    "Reading the version string from 'unifyops_core/__init__.py'",

  "sinks": [
    "No direct sinks identified; the script primarily reads files and sets up package metadata."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Read version string from __init__.py -> pass version to setup()",
    "Read long description from README.md -> pass to setup()"
  ],
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard setup procedures with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard practices to read package version and description data, then calls setuptools.setup() with appropriate parameters. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. The regex used for version extraction is straightforward, and the file reads are simple. No data leaks, malicious code, or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply reads package metadata and configures the package build process.",
