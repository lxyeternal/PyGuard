  "purpose": "Setup script for the unifyops-core Python package to handle installation and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'unifyops_core/__init__.py', reads long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands; primarily file reading.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and long description, then passes configuration to setuptools for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of regex to extract version is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the package version from a specific file using regex, then reads the long description from a markdown file. It sets up package metadata for distribution via setuptools. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and adheres typical setup conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It correctly manages package metadata without executing untrusted code or including hidden behaviors.",
