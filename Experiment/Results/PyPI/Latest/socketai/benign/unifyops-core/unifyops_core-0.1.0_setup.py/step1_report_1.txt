  "purpose": "Setup script for the unifyops-core Python package, primarily used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading version from __init__.py, reading long description from README.md",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data is used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reading version string from __init__.py -> setting package version in setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading version info via regex from a source file, reading a markdown file for long description, and calling setuptools.setup() with metadata. No untrusted input is used in a way that affects security. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The version extraction uses a regex pattern that appears safe and conventional. All dependencies are from known repositories. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and performs standard package setup functions without anomalies.",
