  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'unifyops-core' Python module, performing metadata extraction and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading version from '__init__.py' via regex, reading long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, dynamic code execution, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "File reads for version and description, then passing metadata to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static file reads and setup invocation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script that reads static files for version and description, then calls setuptools.setup() with standard parameters. The regex used for version extraction is conventional and safe. No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The script performs only package configuration tasks, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, performing standard setup operations without any malicious or suspicious elements. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward package configuration script.",
