  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the unifyops-core Python package.",
  "sources": [
    "Reading version from 'unifyops_core/__init__.py'",
    "Reading long description from 'README.md'",
    "Input data includes file contents for version and description"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "None identified that process untrusted data or pose security risks"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "File contents are read and stored in variables, then used in setup() parameters"
  ],
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. Use of regex to parse version is standard and safe here.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: reading version info from a source file, reading README content, and passing these along with metadata to setuptools.setup(). No external untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity are present. The code is straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, conventional setup script with no malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks detected.",
