  "sources": "Reading version from __init__.py, reading README.md file",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; setup configuration and file reads are standard and safe",
  "flows": "Reading version and long description files, then passing data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns observed. The version extraction regex is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: reading version info, long description, and configuring package metadata. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. All file reads are from static, local files. No untrusted data sources or sinks identified. The code adheres to typical Python packaging patterns and appears secure.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for packaging a Python module. No signs of malware, malicious code, or security risks were found.",
