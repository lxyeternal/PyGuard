  "purpose": "A structured logging utility that formats logs as JSON, gathers metadata, manages metrics, and supports trace context for observability.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (HOSTNAME, SERVICE_NAME, ENVIRONMENT), context variables (metadata_var, correlation_id_var, trace_id_var, span_id_var), and log record attributes (message, level, timestamp, source info).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Metadata and context variables are collected and flattened; logs are formatted into JSON with optional trace info; errors during serialization are handled gracefully.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. parse_uuids function's role appears benign; no malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured logging utility. It reads environment and context data, formats logs as JSON, tracks metrics, and implements rate limiting. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. Error handling is appropriate, and the code does not contain obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with its benign, standard nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign logging utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified by potential data leakage if environment variables contain secrets, but this is a common risk in logging systems, not malicious activity.",
