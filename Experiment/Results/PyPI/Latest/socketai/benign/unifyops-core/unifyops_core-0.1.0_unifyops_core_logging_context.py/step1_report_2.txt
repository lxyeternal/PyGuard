{
  "purpose": "This code provides a custom logging adapter for injecting contextual metadata into log records to facilitate consistent and enriched logging across asynchronous boundaries.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from ContextVars (`correlation_id_var`, `metadata_var`) and function arguments (`metadata`, `event`).",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems or perform untrusted output; it only processes and enriches log data internally.",
  "flows": "Source variables (`correlation_id_var`, `metadata_var`) are accessed and their values are added to log records during processing, without any external output or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated or unusual language features. The logging process is standard, and no suspicious data handling or external communication occurs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom logging adapter that enriches logs with module metadata, request metadata, inline metadata, and correlation IDs sourced from ContextVars. The `process` method adds these contextual details to each log record, facilitating comprehensive logging. The `get_logger` function returns an instance of this adapter with optional module metadata. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to serve purely as an internal utility for enhanced logging.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard, well-structured logging utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply enriches log data for debugging and tracing purposes, with no harmful side effects or suspicious behavior detected.",
