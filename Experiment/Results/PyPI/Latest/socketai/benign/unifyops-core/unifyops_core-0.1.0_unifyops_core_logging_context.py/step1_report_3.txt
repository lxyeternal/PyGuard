{
  "purpose": "The code provides a custom logging adapter to inject contextual information into log records, including metadata, correlation IDs, and structured logging, facilitating consistent and enriched logging across asynchronous boundaries.",
  "sources": "The code reads context variables `correlation_id_var` and `metadata_var` via `get()` calls, and uses parameters `metadata` in function calls and class initialization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks that lead to data leaks, code injection, or system compromise. It primarily manipulates logging metadata.",
  "flows": "Context variables (`correlation_id_var`, `metadata_var`) are retrieved and merged into log entries. User-supplied `metadata` is also incorporated. No external network or file operations are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. The code uses standard logging practices, and there are no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging adapter class `ContextLoggerAdapter` that enriches log messages with metadata and correlation IDs from context variables. It also supports structured logging. The `get_logger` function creates and returns an instance of this adapter. The usage pattern is typical for context-aware logging and does not include any suspicious or malicious features. No external data sources, network connections, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be well-structured, safe, and intended solely for logging enhancements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a context-aware logging adapter for Python applications. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It operates within normal logging and context management practices, with no indications of supply chain or malware concerns.",
