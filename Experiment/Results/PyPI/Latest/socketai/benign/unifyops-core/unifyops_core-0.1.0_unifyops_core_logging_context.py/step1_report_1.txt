{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom logging adapter that injects contextual metadata, such as request-specific information and correlation IDs, into log records for better traceability across asynchronous boundaries.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from ContextVars (metadata_var and correlation_id_var), function arguments (metadata), and class attributes (module_metadata).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; the code only formats and enriches log messages without any external data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Sources (ContextVars, function args) flow into the process method to augment log data; this data is then used in logging calls made through the adapter's methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are evident. The code appears to be standard for context-aware logging.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom logging adapter to include contextual metadata in logs. It retrieves per-request data via ContextVars, merges inline metadata, and adds correlation IDs. The get_logger function creates instances with optional module metadata. No external system calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are present. The code focuses solely on logging enhancements without any suspicious or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a context-aware logging system with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and intended for debugging and traceability purposes.",
