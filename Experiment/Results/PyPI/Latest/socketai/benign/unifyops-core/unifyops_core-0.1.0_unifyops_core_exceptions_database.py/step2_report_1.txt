  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for database errors.\n   - All parameters are used solely for constructing messages and details.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external calls, or handling of untrusted data beyond message composition.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious activity or security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that the code only constructs exception messages and details, with no external data flows or dangerous operations.\n   - No inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code only handles exception message formatting without executing untrusted code or performing harmful operations, the risk score should remain low.\n   - The reports' assigned scores (all zero for malware and obfuscation, zero for security risk) are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - No malicious behavior is present.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n   - Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's structure and behavior.\n   - They correctly interpret that the code is purely for error reporting.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (negligible security risk)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for database error handling. It does not pose any security threat or malicious activity risk. The reports' evaluations are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
