{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various database-related errors in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' and 'fastapi'; use of 'app.exceptions.base'; class initializers and attribute assignments; creation of detailed error messages and optional details.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__() calls passing messages and details; error messages constructed from input parameters; no direct data sinks or untrusted data execution observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., operation, host, query_type, constraint_name, filter_criteria) flow into message strings and details dictionaries, then into the superclass constructor.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or data exfiltration logic. The code cleanly defines structured exceptions with customizable messages.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes tailored for database error scenarios, with logic to generate descriptive error messages and optional detailed info. It uses input parameters to craft these messages but does not perform any unsafe operations, dynamic code execution, or external calls. The design focuses on informative error reporting, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. No data leakage, malicious side effects, or security risks are evident from the code. It maintains best practices for exception handling and logging support.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured set of custom exception classes for database errors. It contains no malicious behavior, no malicious data flows, and no suspicious anomalies. The implementation appears to serve purely functional and informative purposes for error handling in a database context.",
