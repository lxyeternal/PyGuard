  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for database error handling.\n   - Exception messages are constructed based on input parameters; no dynamic code execution, external calls, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.\n   - The reports confirm that the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or supply chain risks.\n\n2. **Logical and Structural Soundness:**\n   - Exception classes inherit from a base `ServerError`.\n   - They provide detailed error messages and optional structured details.\n   - The message construction logic is consistent and based on input parameters, which is standard practice.\n   - No anomalies, such as suspicious patterns or hidden behaviors, are detected.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign a very low or zero risk score, consistent with the findings.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Improvements:**\n   - The code is well-structured; no evident flaws or security issues.\n   - The only minor note is that error messages could potentially leak sensitive info if misused, but the code itself is designed to avoid that by carefully constructing messages.\n\n5. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for database error handling.\n   - No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate | Justification                                                  |\n|-----------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                | No malicious activity or payloads detected.                   |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                | Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.           |\n| Security Risk   | 0                | No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or malicious data flows. |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard set of exception classes for database error handling with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified based on the analysis.",
