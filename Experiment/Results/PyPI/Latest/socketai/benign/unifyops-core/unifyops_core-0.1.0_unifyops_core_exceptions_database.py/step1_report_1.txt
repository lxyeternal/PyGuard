{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various database errors in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data primarily through exception instantiation parameters such as message, operation, table, details, host, port, database, query_type, error_code, transaction_operation, migration_version, migration_name, migration_direction, constraint_name, constraint_type, column, filter_criteria.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs exception messages and details, which are used for error reporting. No untrusted data is directly executed or sent over a network; no code injection points are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence the construction of error messages and details within exception objects, which are then raised and potentially logged or returned by API endpoints. No malicious flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward exception class definitions with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base ServerError, used for various database error scenarios. Parameters influence error message composition but do not involve any execution of untrusted input as code. There are no network connections, data leaks, or malicious payloads. All input parameters are used solely for message construction, with no unsafe handling or suspicious operations. No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for database errors, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any dangerous operations, data leaks, or obfuscated behaviors. The overall security risk is negligible.",
