{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for various database-related errors, providing structured error handling and messages.",
  "sources": "None of the classes read input or untrusted data directly; they mainly generate exceptions with optional details.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages and details could potentially leak sensitive information if improperly used; no external network or file access occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this code, as it only constructs exception objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns such as code injection, hidden behavior, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code uses standard exception handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for database errors, with optional detailed messages and structured data. There are no external calls, data leaks, or malicious logic. The messages are dynamically constructed based on provided parameters, but do not include sensitive data like credentials or secrets. The class structures and message formations follow expected patterns for error handling. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of custom exception classes for database errors with no malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily facilitates error reporting and debugging within an application. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
