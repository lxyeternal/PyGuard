{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various database-related errors in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing and fastapi; base class import from app.exceptions.base; internal exception class initializations; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages, details dictionaries, and attributes potentially containing sensitive info, passed to super().__init__.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated with specific parameters, generate messages and details, and pass data to base class, potentially exposing info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No external network or file operations present. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for database errors with customizable messages and details. It carefully constructs messages based on provided info, avoiding inclusion of sensitive info such as credentials. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network access, or backdoors. All data flows are internal, used for error reporting within the application. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns observed. The code appears purely for error handling, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of well-structured exception classes for database error handling in a FastAPI app. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe and intended for error reporting.",
