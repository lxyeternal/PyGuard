{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling various database-related errors in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, class attributes, and optional details parameters. No external data sources or user inputs are directly read within this module.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages and details are constructed from input parameters and included in exception instances. No data is written to external systems, files, or network locations within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence the construction of exception messages and details; these are passed to the superclass constructor for raising exceptions. No external data flows or untrusted data propagation are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code uses standard exception handling patterns. There are no obfuscated constructs or dynamic code execution. It is purely a definition of exception classes with parameter-based message construction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes related to database errors, with constructors that generate descriptive messages and details based on input parameters. It does not perform any external operations, network communications, or data manipulations beyond exception message formulation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code adheres to good practices for exception definitions and parameter handling.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward, well-structured set of custom exception classes for database error handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate application code focused on exception management.",
