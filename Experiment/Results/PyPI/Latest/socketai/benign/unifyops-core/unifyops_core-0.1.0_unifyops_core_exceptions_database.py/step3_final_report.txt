{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for various database-related errors, providing structured messages and details for error handling in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Input parameters used to construct error messages and details within exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data handling; exception messages are generated from parameters only.",
  "flows": "Parameters flow into message and details construction; no external or untrusted data flows into code execution or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and solely for error reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of well-structured custom exception classes inheriting from a base error, constructing messages based on parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data beyond message formatting is present. The code does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. All parameters are used solely for informative messages and structured details, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of database error exceptions. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free from obfuscation. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.",
