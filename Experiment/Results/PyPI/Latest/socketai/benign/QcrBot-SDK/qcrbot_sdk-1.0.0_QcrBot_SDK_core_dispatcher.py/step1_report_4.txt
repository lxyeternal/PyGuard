{
  "purpose": "This code implements an event dispatching system that manages and routes events to appropriate handlers based on rules and priorities.",
  "sources": "Event objects passed to the dispatch method; handler functions invoked with injected parameters.",
  "sinks": "Injected parameters into handlers; potential if handlers perform unsafe operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Event objects flow from dispatch to handlers; match results are used to inject parameters into handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network connections are present. The code primarily manages event-handler registration and invocation. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution identified.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an event dispatcher class that registers, removes, matches, and dispatches events to handlers. It uses inspection to inject event data and match results into handlers. No network calls, file operations, or external data exfiltration are present. The match method supports various rule types, including type-based, string prefix, regex, and callables, with error handling. The dispatch method carefully injects event and match data into handler parameters, with type conversions and error logging. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The focus is on event routing logic, with safe usage of async functions and reflection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard event dispatch system with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It securely manages handlers and performs controlled parameter injection. No malicious code or security risks are detected in the provided code.",
