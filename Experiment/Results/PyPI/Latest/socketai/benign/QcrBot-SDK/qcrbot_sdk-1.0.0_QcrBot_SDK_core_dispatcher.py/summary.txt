  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard event dispatch implementation with no malicious intent or behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2 due to the potential for misuse if malicious handlers are registered externally. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in event-driven systems."
