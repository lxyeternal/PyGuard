{
  "purpose": "Define a base event model for handling events in the QcrBot SDK, specifically for OneBot v11 protocol.",
  "sources": "Imports from datetime and pydantic, class attributes, and class methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points involving untrusted input data; the code mainly defines data structures and validation logic.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., timestamp) flows into the 'format_time' validator, which transforms numeric timestamps into datetime objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The use of pydantic's field validators is standard. No dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'BaseEvent' inheriting from pydantic's BaseModel. It includes a datetime field with a validator that converts numeric timestamps to datetime objects, which is a common pattern for handling timestamp data. The get_session_id method constructs a session string based on the presence of user or group IDs, which appears standard. No external data is fetched or written, and no suspicious code logic is present. The code is well-structured and does not contain any anomalies suggestive of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate part of an event handling SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
