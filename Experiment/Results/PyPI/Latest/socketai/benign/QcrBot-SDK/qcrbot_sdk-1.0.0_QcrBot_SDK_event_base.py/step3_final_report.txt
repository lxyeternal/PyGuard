  "purpose": "Define a base event class for handling OneBot v11 events with timestamp validation and session ID generation.",
  "sources": "Attributes 'time', 'self_id', 'post_type', and optional 'user_id'/'group_id' attributes used in methods.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (timestamp, user_id, group_id) flows through validators and methods to produce formatted time and session ID.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. The only subtlety is reliance on subclass attributes 'user_id' and 'group_id' which are not defined here but are typical in event subclasses.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Pydantic model for event data with a timestamp validator converting numeric timestamps to datetime objects. The get_session_id method constructs identifiers based on optional attributes, which are expected to be present in subclasses. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication. The code is well-structured, safe, and typical for event handling systems. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1, confidence=1) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured event data model with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and align with the code's behavior.",
