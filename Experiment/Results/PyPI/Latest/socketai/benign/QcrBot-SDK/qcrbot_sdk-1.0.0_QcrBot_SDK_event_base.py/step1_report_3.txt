{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for handling events in the OneBot v11 framework with data validation and session ID generation.",
  "sources": "Input data for 'time', 'self_id', 'post_type', and optional 'user_id' and 'group_id' attributes during class instantiation or validation.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent to external systems, network, or stored insecurely within this code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into class attributes; 'format_time' validates and transforms 'time'; 'get_session_id' derives session identifiers from class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Use of pydantic validators for time formatting is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base event class using pydantic for data validation. It safely handles timestamp conversion, allows extra fields, and generates session IDs based on available attributes. No insecure patterns, malicious logic, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured base event class with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs standard data validation and attribute handling without external communication or risky operations.",
