{
  "purpose": "The code implements the core class for a chatbot SDK, handling WebSocket connection, event dispatching, API calls, and message processing.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from WebSocket data received via _handle_raw_data, user inputs in commands, and API responses from API client methods.",
  "sinks": "Methods that send data back over the network, such as send_private_msg, send_group_msg, and other API actions that transmit messages or perform operations on external services.",
  "flows": "Incoming data from WebSocket -> _handle_raw_data -> parse_event or response handler -> event dispatch or API response resolution; Outgoing messages via send methods calling API client.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious domain connections or network calls outside API functions; message processing appears standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected. Proper exception handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK core class, initializing a WebSocket adapter, managing connection lifecycle, parsing events, dispatching handlers, and providing API wrappers for message and group management. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, backdoors, or hidden network communications. All data flows are controlled through defined API methods. No suspicious patterns like hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity are present. Error handling and logs appear standard and legitimate. The code functions as expected for a secure chatbot SDK core.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate core implementation of a chatbot SDK with standard features. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates as expected for managing WebSocket connections, events, and API interactions within a chat platform. Overall, it is secure based on the provided fragment.",
