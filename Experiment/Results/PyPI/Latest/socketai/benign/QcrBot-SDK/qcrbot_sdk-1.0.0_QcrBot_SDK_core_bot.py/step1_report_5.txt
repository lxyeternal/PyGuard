{
  "purpose": "The code defines a core SDK class for a chatbot framework, managing WebSocket connections, event handling, and API interactions.",
  "sources": "Data sources include WebSocket data, event data parsed from incoming messages, and API responses from various API client methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve API calls that send messages or perform actions, and event dispatching that could trigger user-defined handlers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from WebSocket raw data to event parsing and handling, with responses routed back to the API or dispatched as events.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible. The code mostly contains standard SDK setup and event handling logic. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. Logging levels are configurable, but no sensitive info is logged explicitly.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a chatbot SDK core class, with proper separation of concerns, event registration, and API calls. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious data handling mechanisms are present. There are no signs of data exfiltration, system manipulation, or covert channels. The data flows involve typical message handling, API interactions, and event dispatching. No hardcoded secrets or network connections to suspicious domains are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured SDK core component with no evident malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected functions of managing connections, events, and API calls without engaging in any harmful activities.",
