  "purpose": "The code implements a core SDK class for managing WebSocket connections, event handling, and API interactions for a chatbot framework.",
  "sources": "WebSocket raw data, event parsing, API responses, configuration parameters",
  "sinks": "Event dispatching, API call parameters, message sending functions",
  "flows": "WebSocket data → parse_event or response handling → event dispatch or API response resolution",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code segments detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK core class managing connection lifecycle, event parsing, and API calls. It handles data securely, with proper exception handling and no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The data flow is controlled, and external inputs are sanitized. No backdoors, network exfiltration, or dynamic code execution are present. The code's logic aligns with typical SDK patterns, and no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure SDK core component with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The supply chain security risk is negligible, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2). The code does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
