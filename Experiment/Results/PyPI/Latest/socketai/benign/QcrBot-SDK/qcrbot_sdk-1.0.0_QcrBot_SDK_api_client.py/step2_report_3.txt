  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a WebSocket API client, handling messaging, group management, etc. It reads data from parameters and responses, sends data over WebSocket, and validates inputs. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The report correctly notes the absence of hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or backdoors. It emphasizes proper validation, exception handling, and logging.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — seems reasonable given the analysis.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's apparent behavior. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API client behavior, no malicious signs, proper validation, and exception handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. It correctly identifies that the code is a typical WebSocket API wrapper with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a WebSocket API client, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior. Proper validation and error handling are in place.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is thorough. No signs of malicious activity, code injection, or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard WebSocket API client, with safe data flows, no hardcoded secrets, and proper exception handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the code's role as an API wrapper with no malicious signs.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — suitable.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. The code is a typical API client, with no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or misleading constructs.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The reports assign 0.2, indicating low security risk, mainly due to the potential for untrusted data to be sent over WebSocket. This is a reasonable assessment, considering the code's role as an API wrapper.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- **Potential for misuse:** While the code itself appears safe, the main concern is how untrusted data might be used or crafted by malicious actors. However, the code performs validation and error handling, mitigating some risks.\n\n- **Supply chain concerns:** The code is a standard API client; no embedded secrets or suspicious logic are present.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Based on the code and reports, the current scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (confirmed safe)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to potential misuse of untrusted data)\n\n**Overall estimate:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured WebSocket API client with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The current scoring reflects its safety profile accurately.",
