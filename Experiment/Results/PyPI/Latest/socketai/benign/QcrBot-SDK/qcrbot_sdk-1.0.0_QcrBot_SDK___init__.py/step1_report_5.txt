{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the QcrBot SDK by importing various modules, setting up exports, and handling import errors for core components.",
  "sources": "The code reads internal module imports, version information, and optional core class imports. No external data input sources are present.",
  "targets": "The code exports classes, functions, and variables for external use. It does not handle or process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input or output, as the code mainly performs module setup and import handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated sections are present. The try-except blocks for imports are standard and contain no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module imports, error handling for missing core components, and defines __all__ for exports. It includes safe import statements, error logging, and cleanup of imported names. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The error handling is straightforward, logging critical errors if core modules cannot be imported. No suspicious code patterns or hardcoded credentials are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard SDK initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs normal module setup, error handling, and export definitions without any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
