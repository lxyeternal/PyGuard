{
  "purpose": "The code initializes the QcrBot SDK package, importing various modules, handling import errors, and setting up exports and versioning for the SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data mainly from internal module imports and environment during import. No external input or untrusted data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted, such as network connections, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The code flow is limited to importing modules, setting up exports, and error handling; there are no source-to-sink data flows indicative of malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the handling of ImportError for core components with logging failure, but this is standard error handling rather than suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages imports, error handling, and module exports for the SDK. It imports core classes, modules, and utilities, and includes error handling for failed imports of core components. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated sections are evident. The import and cleanup logic is straightforward and typical for SDK initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard SDK initialization script without any malicious intent. There are no suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. It mainly organizes imports and error handling, consistent with secure SDK packaging.",
