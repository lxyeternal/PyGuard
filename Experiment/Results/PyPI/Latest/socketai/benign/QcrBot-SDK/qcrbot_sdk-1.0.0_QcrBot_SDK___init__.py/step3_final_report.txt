  "purpose": "This code initializes the SDK by importing modules, handling optional dependencies, setting version info, and cleaning up temporary variables. It ensures the core Bot class is available if possible and sets up exports for external use.",
  "sources": "Module imports, including .api, .event, .message, .core, and .utils; error handling for optional core Bot import; cleanup of temporary variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external input or network activity.",
  "flows": "Import statements and error handling flow, with optional core Bot import and subsequent cleanup of temporary variables.",
  "anomalies": "Standard try-except for optional import; cleanup of imported variables; no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK setup script, importing internal modules, handling import errors gracefully, setting version info, and cleaning up namespace pollution. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The import error handling is a common pattern for optional dependencies. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident. The cleanup of temporary variables is standard practice. Overall, the code is benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK initialization script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The minimal risk scores assigned in the reports are justified by standard error handling practices but do not indicate actual security issues. The malware score is correctly zero, and obfuscation is absent. The overall security risk is negligible.",
