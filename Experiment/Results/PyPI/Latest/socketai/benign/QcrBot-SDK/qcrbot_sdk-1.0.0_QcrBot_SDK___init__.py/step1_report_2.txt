{
  "purpose": "This module initializes the QcrBot SDK by importing various components, setting up exports, and configuring logging and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.api, .event, .message, .core, .utils), dynamic import of Bot class, and logging setup.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed; no network or file operations are visible.",
  "flows": "Imports and exception handling flow during module initialization; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import with exception handling for core Bot class; standard pattern. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles module setup: importing classes, defining __all__, handling ImportError for core.Bot, and cleanup of temporary variables. No network connections, data leaks, or malicious code are apparent. The try-except for importing Bot appears to be a robustness measure. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as part of a larger SDK setup without evident malicious activity.",
