{
  "purpose": "Initialize and expose components of the QcrBot SDK, including importing various modules and setting up exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.api, .event, .message, .core, .utils), reading module attributes, and error handling via try-except blocks.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Imports and attribute exports, with error handling influencing module availability.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard module import and cleanup practices. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module imports, exception handling, version setting, and cleanup of local variables. The try-except block around importing 'Bot' handles ImportError gracefully, logging a critical error if it occurs. No untrusted input sources, external data flows, or risky operations are present. The cleanup of imported names at the end is a common practice to reduce namespace pollution. The overall structure is consistent with standard Python package initialization scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard, benign module initializer for the QcrBot SDK. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. No evidence of supply chain attacks or malware was detected.",
