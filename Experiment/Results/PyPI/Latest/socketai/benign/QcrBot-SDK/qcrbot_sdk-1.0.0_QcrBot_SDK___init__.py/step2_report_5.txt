  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to determine the accuracy of their assessments and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward SDK initialization script.\n- It performs module imports, error handling for optional core components, sets version info, and defines exports.\n- There is no evidence of external input processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The error handling with try-except blocks is standard practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.\n- Cleanup of imported names at the end is typical to avoid namespace pollution.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states the code's purpose.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No external data sources or sinks, no data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the handling of ImportError, which is normal.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard SDK init code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 (slightly above zero, perhaps due to error handling logs, but acceptable).\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No external data involved.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of dynamic import with exception handling is normal.\n- **Analysis:** Properly identifies the code as standard setup.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data or external data sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard practices.\n- **Analysis:** Well-reasoned.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign SDK initialization.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No external data involved.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Properly identifies the code as standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 (slightly above zero, perhaps due to the dynamic import handling, but still reasonable).\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data or malicious patterns.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Properly states the code is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard SDK initialization script.\n- No suspicious data flows, external inputs, or malicious code are present.\n- The minor risk scores (0.1-0.2) are acceptable given the logging and error handling, but they do not indicate actual security issues.\n- Malware score is correctly zero in all reports, consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code, a **very low risk (0.0-0.1)** is appropriate. Slightly elevated scores (0.1-0.2) are acceptable due to standard error handling but do not indicate real risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**The code is a benign, standard SDK initialization script with no malicious or suspicious elements.** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 (depending on conservative or lenient scoring)\n\n**Overall, no security concerns are identified.**",
