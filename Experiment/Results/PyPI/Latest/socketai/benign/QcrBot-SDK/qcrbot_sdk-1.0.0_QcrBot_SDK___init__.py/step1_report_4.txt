{
  "purpose": "The code initializes the QcrBot SDK module, importing various components and setting up exports for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.api, .event, .message, .core, .utils), dynamic import of Bot class, and logging.",
  "sinks": "Logging statements, dynamic import of Bot class, deletion of imported modules at the end.",
  "flows": "Import statements and exception handling flow to the export setup; the import of Bot class could potentially execute external code if imported modules are malicious, but no external data input is directly involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code attempts to import internal modules and logs errors if import fails, but there are no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Use of try-except around imports is normal for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module imports, exception handling, and cleanup of imported names. The only notable dynamic behavior is the conditional import of the Bot class, with error logging. No external data input, network activity, or malicious payload is evident. The module manages its exports and handles import failures gracefully. No obfuscated code, suspicious network connections, or credential leaks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard Python SDK initialization script with no apparent malicious intent. It performs expected import and cleanup operations, with robust error handling. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
