{
  "purpose": "Defines event data models for a messaging SDK, facilitating structured handling of various message and event types.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters such as user_id, message, group_id, and other event-specific fields.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; primarily data validation and schema enforcement.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input fields into model instances; no external or network data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Pydantic data models representing different message and event types. It uses 'extra=\"allow\"' which permits additional fields but is common for flexible schemas. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The models serve as structured data containers, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of standard imports and straightforward class definitions further indicates benign design. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, standard data models for an event-driven messaging SDK. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The current scoring accurately reflects its benign nature.",
