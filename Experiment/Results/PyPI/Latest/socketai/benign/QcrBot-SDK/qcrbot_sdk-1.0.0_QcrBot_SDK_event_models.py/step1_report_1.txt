{
  "purpose": "Defines various event data models for a messaging SDK, including message, notice, meta, and request events.",
  "sources": "Imports from other modules (message, segment, utils.log) and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Data primarily flows through data models; no execution or external data processing identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present. Usage of dynamic attributes (extra='allow') is benign in this context. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly data model definitions using Pydantic for type validation, representing different event types in a messaging SDK. There are no external data sinks, no code execution, and no suspicious logic. The models allow for flexible data input (via extra='allow') but do not process untrusted data maliciously. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior is observable.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides type-safe data models for event handling within a messaging SDK without any malicious intent or security risks. The code appears safe and typical for such an application.",
