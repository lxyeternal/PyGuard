  "purpose": "Define data models for various event types in a messaging SDK, including message events, notice events, and request events.",
  "sources": "Imports from other modules, type annotations, and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; code primarily defines data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious patterns; code uses standard data modeling with pydantic and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Pydantic models representing different event types, with static type annotations and configuration. No code execution, network operations, or data handling that could be malicious is present. The code's structure and content are typical for SDK data modeling, with no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate data model definition for event handling within a messaging SDK. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is to define structured data models without any suspicious behaviors.",
