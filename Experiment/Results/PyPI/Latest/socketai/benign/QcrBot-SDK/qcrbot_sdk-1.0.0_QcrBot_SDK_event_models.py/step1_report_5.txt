{
  "purpose": "Define data models for various event types in a messaging SDK, including message events, notices, requests, and meta-events.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, type annotations, and default values within class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is processed or output in a potentially unsafe manner.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to data assignment within model classes; no untrusted input processing or data manipulation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. No obfuscated code, external code execution, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data model definitions using Pydantic for structured data validation. It imports modules and defines classes with typed attributes, default values, and allowed extra fields. There are no external inputs processed, no network calls, and no data transformations that could be malicious. The structure aligns with standard SDK event modeling, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data model setup for a messaging SDK with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and does not contain any malicious code or backdoors.",
