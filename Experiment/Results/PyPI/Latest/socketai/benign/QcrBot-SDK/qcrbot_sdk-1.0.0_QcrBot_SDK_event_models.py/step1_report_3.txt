{
  "purpose": "Define data models for various event types related to messages, meta events, notices, and requests in a messaging SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements; class attribute definitions; type annotations; default values; config settings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted in a malicious manner; the code primarily defines data structures.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows leading to unsafe operations; data models are used for serialization/deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing and pydantic modules, then defines multiple data models with type annotations, optional fields, and configuration options. These models represent various event types in a messaging system. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling that could be malicious are present. The code appears to be a typical schema definition for events, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of data model definitions for messaging events, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and serves purely as a schema specification.",
