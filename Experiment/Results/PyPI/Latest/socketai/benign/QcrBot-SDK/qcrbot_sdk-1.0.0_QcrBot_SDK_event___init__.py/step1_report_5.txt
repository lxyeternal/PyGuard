{
  "purpose": "This module initializes the event package by importing necessary classes and functions for event handling within the SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .base, .models, .parser, .typing",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external interactions present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only static imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .models import *' can be risky but is common in package __init__.py files; no suspicious code or hidden behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward import and export operations, setting up the namespace for the package. No user input, network activity, or data processing occurs. The deletion of 'models' after import is standard for namespace cleanup. No signs of malicious code, code injection, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization script with no malicious or security risk behavior. It simply organizes module exports for the SDK.",
