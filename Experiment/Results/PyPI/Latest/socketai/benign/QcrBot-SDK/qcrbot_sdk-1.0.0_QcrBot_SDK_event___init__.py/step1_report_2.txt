{
  "purpose": "This module initializes the event package by importing various components and defining exports for event handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .base, .models, .parser, .typing",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily static imports and export definitions",
  "anomalies": "The line 'del models' is unusual; it removes the 'models' module from the namespace after importing all its contents. This is an uncommon pattern but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules and specific components for event handling. The 'del models' statement is unusual because it removes the 'models' module from the namespace, possibly to prevent external access or to avoid namespace pollution. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The module appears to be straightforward and primarily involved in organizing imports and exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard initialization script with an uncommon but benign 'del models' statement. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
