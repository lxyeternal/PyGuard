{
  "purpose": "This module initializes the QcrBot_SDK event package by importing specific classes, functions, and types for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module files (.py) such as .base, .models, .parser, and .typing, importing their contents.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, network communication, or handling of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only imports and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "The 'del models' statement deletes the imported 'models' module reference, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and specific symbols for package initialization and explicitly exports selected classes and functions. The 'del models' line removes the 'models' import, possibly to prevent exposing it. No user input handling, network operations, or code execution is present. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal package initialization script with no malicious behavior or security risks. The only unusual aspect is the explicit deletion of the 'models' module from the namespace, which does not pose security concerns.",
