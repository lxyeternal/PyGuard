  "purpose": "Initialize the __init__.py module for the QcrBot_SDK/event package by importing specific classes and functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from .base, .models, .parser, and .typing modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs imports and cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .models import *' could potentially import unintended symbols, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module initialization tasks: importing specific components for public API, defining __all__ for exports, and deleting the models namespace. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious behavior is present. The use of 'del models' is a typical cleanup step. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package __init__.py file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to structure the package exports appropriately.",
