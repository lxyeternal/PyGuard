{
  "purpose": "This module initializes the QcrBot_SDK event package by importing relevant classes, functions, and variables for event handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .models, .parser, .typing) and the deletion of the 'models' namespace.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present. No external data input or output handling is evident.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up module namespace; no data flow from input to output or external systems is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The 'del models' statement is unusual but not malicious; it merely removes the 'models' namespace after import. No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules and symbols to structure event handling functionality. The 'del models' statement might be used to prevent namespace pollution, which is a benign pattern. No data processing, external data access, or code execution occurs. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a module initializer for event handling with no malicious or security concerns. The only notable aspect is the removal of the 'models' namespace, which is benign.",
