  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward package __init__.py file.\n- The only unusual element noted is the `del models` statement, which is benign and not malicious.\n- No evidence of dynamic code execution, external data handling, hardcoded secrets, or network activity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n- The code is primarily about organizing imports and exports for the package.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is consistent.\n- The security risk scores are 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1, with one at 0.9), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The use of `from .models import *` is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is common in package __init__.py files. It does not indicate malicious activity.\n- The `del models` statement is unusual but benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is standard package initialization with no security concerns.",
