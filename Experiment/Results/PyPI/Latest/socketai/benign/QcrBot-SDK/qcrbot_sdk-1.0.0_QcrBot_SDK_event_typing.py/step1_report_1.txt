{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases for event handling, matching, and processing within a larger event-driven framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'typing' module and a local module '.base'. No external data input or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; code is solely type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is standard type alias definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing annotations, defines type aliases for event handler functions, match rules, and handler tuples. It references a local 'BaseEvent' class. There are no functions executing logic, no data processing, and no external inputs or outputs. It appears to be purely type annotation setup code, which is typical for type hinting in Python projects. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines type aliases for event handling structures and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard type annotation code used for clarity and type safety in a larger event-driven system.",
