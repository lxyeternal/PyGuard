  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports describe the code as straightforward type alias definitions for an event-driven SDK, with imports from the typing module and a local BaseEvent class. They uniformly conclude that there are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code in question is present and matches the description. It only contains type alias definitions, import statements, and no runtime logic.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malicious behavior, such as data leaks, code injection, or obfuscation, are evident.\n- **External data/input:** No external data sources or untrusted inputs are involved.\n- **Security risk:** Given the nature of the code, the security risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Errors or flaws in logic:** The reports are consistent; no errors or flaws are identified in the reasoning.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- Since the code is purely type alias definitions, no runtime execution, data handling, or external interactions occur.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The uniformity of the reports and their conclusions seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Risk score:** The risk score of 0 in all reports is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the provided reports and code, I agree with the assigned scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**No further action needed.** This code is standard type annotation setup with no security concerns.",
