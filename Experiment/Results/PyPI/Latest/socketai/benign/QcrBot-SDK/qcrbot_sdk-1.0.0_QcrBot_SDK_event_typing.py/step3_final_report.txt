  "purpose": "Type alias definitions for event handling in a Python SDK, establishing types for event handlers, match rules, and handler tuples.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'typing' module and local 'base' module; no data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process or output data, only defines types.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely static type alias definitions with no runtime execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard import and type alias syntax, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only type alias definitions and import statements, with no functions, data processing, or runtime logic. It is a typical setup for type annotations in a Python SDK. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. There are no external data sources or untrusted inputs, and the code does not perform any actions that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as type alias definitions for event handling. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the scores of zero are justified. No further action or modification is necessary.",
