{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and import statements for event handling in a Python SDK related to QcrBot.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' module, local import from '.base' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code primarily defines type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing components and a local BaseEvent class. It defines type aliases for event handler functions, match rules, and handler tuples, using standard Python typing constructs. No user input, untrusted data handling, or external data sources are present. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are apparent. The code's purpose appears to be setting up type annotations for event-driven architecture within the SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for event handling, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of the SDK's internal structure, with no security risks identified.",
