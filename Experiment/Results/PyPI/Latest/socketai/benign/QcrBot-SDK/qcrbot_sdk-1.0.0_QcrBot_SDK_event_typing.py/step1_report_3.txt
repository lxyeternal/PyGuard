  "purpose": "Defines type aliases for event handling and matching in an event-driven SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing module and relative import of BaseEvent from .base.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of type alias definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type hints from the typing module, including Callable, Awaitable, and various type constructs. It defines type aliases for event handlers (functions accepting a BaseEvent and returning an Awaitable[None]), event matcher rules (including types, tuples, regex patterns, and callables), and handler tuples combining handlers, matcher rules, and optional integers. The code appears to be straightforward, with no data processing, no input/output handling, and no suspicious or malicious patterns. The minimalistic nature and standard import pattern suggest it is a typical setup for event handling logic in a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely type alias declarations for event handling; it does not contain or invoke any malicious code or suspicious behavior. There are no security concerns based on this fragment.",
