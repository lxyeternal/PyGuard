  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code consists solely of type alias definitions and import statements.\n   - No dynamic execution, data processing, or untrusted data handling is present.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and is typical for setting up type annotations in a Python SDK.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely type alias definitions with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the code's content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign zero risk, and the code is just type annotations, there's no justification for higher scores.\n   - **Conclusion:** The risk scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n   - The code is standard type alias setup.\n   - **Score of 0** is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward observations.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a standard, harmless type alias setup with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign, purely for type annotations.  \n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behavior is present.  \n- Scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed; the current assessment is accurate.",
