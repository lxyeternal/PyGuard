  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is purely type alias definitions and import statements. There are no functions, data processing, or runtime logic. Therefore, no actual security issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in this code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which is appropriate given the code's nature. Since the code is purely type annotations with no runtime or external interactions, these scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   No report suggests any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code's purpose is internal type hinting, with no external data handling or security concerns. Therefore, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The malware score is correctly set to zero across all reports, as there is no malicious activity or code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions. They focus on what the code actually does—type alias definitions—and correctly conclude that there is no malicious or security concern.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Systematic Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct, no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct, no security risk)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThis code is a straightforward, standard setup for type annotations in a Python SDK. It does not perform any runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions that could pose security risks. The reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate.\n\n**My personal estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThere are no indications of issues, and the code appears entirely benign.",
