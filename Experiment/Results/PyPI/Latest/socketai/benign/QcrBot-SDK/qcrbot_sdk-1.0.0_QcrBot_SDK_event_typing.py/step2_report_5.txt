  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is purely type alias definitions and import statements. There are no functions, data processing, or external inputs. The code is straightforward and standard for setting up type annotations in a Python SDK.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly state that no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.  \n   \n   These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely type annotations with no runtime logic, no external data handling, and no suspicious patterns, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The reports' zero scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Claims about Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly state that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided. All assessments are aligned.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis code is a standard type alias setup for an event-driven system, with no security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No changes are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Overall estimated scores** based on this review:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThese align with the detailed analysis above.",
