  "purpose": "Define type aliases and import necessary modules for event handling in a SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements from typing and relative import from base module.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow analysis needed for this static code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type alias definitions and import statements. It imports standard Python typing constructs and a local BaseEvent class. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, network operations, or other suspicious behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured type annotation setup for an event handling SDK module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type annotation setup for an event-driven SDK and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
