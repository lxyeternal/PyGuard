{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases and imports for event handling in a Python SDK related to QcrBot, specifically for event typing and matching.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' module and relative import of 'BaseEvent' from the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; code mainly defines type aliases and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely type definition and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type hinting constructs and a base class, then defines type aliases for event handler functions, matching rules, and handler tuples. There are no dynamic executions, data manipulations, or untrusted data handling. The code appears to be standard for type annotation setup and does not perform any runtime operations or data processing. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a straightforward setup of type aliases for event handling, with no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard part of a larger SDK structure.",
