{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and import modules for typing and data validation in the QcrBot SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' and 'pydantic'; no data input sources are explicitly present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is observable; the code only defines types and imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type-related modules and defines type variables and union types for use elsewhere in the project. It leverages pydantic's BaseModel for type safety. No dynamic execution, input handling, or data processing is present. The code is minimal and seems to serve as a type alias and interface definition. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a simple, non-malicious module defining type aliases for the SDK. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or network communication. It appears safe and serves purely as a type interface.",
