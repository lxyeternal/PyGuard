  "purpose": "Define type variables and type aliases for use in the QcrBot SDK, facilitating type annotations for parameters, response data, and action messages.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing module and pydantic BaseModel; type variable definitions",
  "sinks": "No data flows to external systems or untrusted data sinks; purely type definitions",
  "flows": "TypeVar and Union declarations used for static type hinting within the codebase",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists of standard type alias and variable definitions",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard type hinting tools and a data validation model from pydantic, then defines type variables bound to BaseModel and unconstrained, as well as a union type for action messages. The code appears to be straightforward, serving as type annotations for the SDK. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The purpose is purely to facilitate type safety and clarity in larger codebase. No external data is read or written, and no untrusted data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign type alias and variable definitions for use in a Python SDK. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
