{
  "purpose": "Define generic type variables and a union type alias for use in a Python SDK, facilitating type annotations for models and responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' and 'pydantic', definitions of TypeVar and Union types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external data handling, or runtime data processing present.",
  "flows": "TypeVar and Union definitions serve as type hints; no data flow or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, minimal, and standard for type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines type variables bound to pydantic's BaseModel and an unbounded type variable, along with a union type alias. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. The code's simplicity and reliance on well-known modules indicate no malicious intent or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code serves purely for static type hinting within a larger project, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard type annotation module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
