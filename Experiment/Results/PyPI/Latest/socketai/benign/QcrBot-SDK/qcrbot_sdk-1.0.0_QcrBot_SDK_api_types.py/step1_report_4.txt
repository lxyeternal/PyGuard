  "purpose": "Define type variables and imports for API typing and response models in the QcrBot SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements for typing and pydantic, and the declaration of type variables and unions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code only defines types and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; straightforward type definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python modules for type annotations and pydantic for data validation. It defines two generic type variables constrained to pydantic's BaseModel and a union type for ActionMessage. All elements serve as type hints for other parts of the SDK, with no dynamic code, data handling, or external input processing. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard setup for type annotations and models in a Python SDK. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
