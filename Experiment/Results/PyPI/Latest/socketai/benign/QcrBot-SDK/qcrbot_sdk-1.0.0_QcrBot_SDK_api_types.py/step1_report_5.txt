  "purpose": "Define type variables and import necessary modules for API typing and data modeling.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' and 'pydantic' modules; type variable declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data flow or potential data leaks; no user input handling present.",
  "flows": "Type variable definitions used for type annotations, no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type variable and alias declarations. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python typing tools and the 'pydantic' library for data validation. It declares two type variables bound to 'BaseModel' and unbound, respectively, and an ActionMessage type union. All are used for type annotations, with no data processing or runtime logic present. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. The code appears to be a simple, safe setup for API typing support.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a minimal, benign module for defining type variables and aliases for API data models. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
