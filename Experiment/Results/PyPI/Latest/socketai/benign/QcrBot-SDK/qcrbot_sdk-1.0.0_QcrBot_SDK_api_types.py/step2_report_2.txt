  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the details step-by-step.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The original code is a straightforward Python module defining type variables and a union type for use in an SDK.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no data processing, I/O, or suspicious behavior.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malware indications are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code?**  \n   - No. The code only imports standard modules (`typing`, `pydantic`) and defines type variables and a union type alias.  \n   - No dynamic code, external data handling, or runtime logic exists.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n   - None. The code is syntactically correct, and the type annotations are appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores given in reports:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Confidence scores are high (1.0), reflecting certainty about benignity.\n\n4. **Risk score justification:**  \n   - Since there's no malicious activity, the risk score should remain at 0.  \n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's content.\n\n6. **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code does not process data or perform operations that could introduce security issues.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct, code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct, no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign, standard type alias module with no security risks.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, safe type definition module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It serves its purpose for type hinting within the SDK without introducing any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. No modifications needed. The code is safe and benign.",
