  "purpose": "Define type aliases and import necessary modules for data validation and typing in the QcrBot SDK API.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'typing' module and 'pydantic' for data validation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O.",
  "flows": "The code only defines types and constants, with no data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules for type annotations and data validation. It defines TypeVars for generic typing constrained to pydantic's BaseModel and an unbounded TypeVar. It also defines a union type for action messages. There are no data processing, I/O, or execution flows present. The code appears straightforward and standard for setting up typing structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple type definition module with no malicious or suspicious elements. It provides type aliases for use elsewhere in the project, with no evident security risks.",
