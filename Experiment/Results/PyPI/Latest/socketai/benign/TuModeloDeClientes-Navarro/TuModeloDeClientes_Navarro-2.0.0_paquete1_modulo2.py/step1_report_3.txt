{
  "purpose": "The code implements a user registration, login, and shopping cart system, including user management and interaction with a 'Cliente' class for shopping functionalities.",
  "sources": "User inputs via input() calls for username, password, age, email, gustos, product, quantity, and store name.",
  "sinks": "User data storage in the USUARIOS dictionary, display functions, and 'Cliente' class methods, which likely handle cart operations and purchases.",
  "flows": "Input data (username, password, personal info, product details) flows into data structures or class methods; user login/authentication logic checks credentials; shopping actions invoke methods on 'Cliente' objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No use of environment variables or insecure code patterns. The code relies on user input without validation for data types (e.g., age and quantity are cast to int without exception handling). No obfuscated code detected. No network connections, data exfiltration, or suspicious system commands observed.",
  "analysis": "The script provides user registration and login functionalities with straightforward data storage in a dictionary. It uses console input/output for interaction. The 'Cliente' class is imported and used for shopping functionalities, but details are not provided. The code contains no suspicious or malicious operations, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. It lacks network activity, external data transmission, or system modifications. Input validation is minimal but typical for such scripts. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for simple user management and shopping simulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard user registration and shopping interface with no apparent malicious intent. It does not perform any harmful actions, data exfiltration, or system tampering. Its security risk is low.",
