{
  "purpose": "To set up and package a Python project named 'TuModeloDeClientes_Navarro' with executable entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads package information, version, author, description, and long description from files and parameters; it also reads 'README.md' for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the main potential sink is the entry point command that executes 'main:main'.",
  "flows": "The setup script defines package configuration and an entry point that would invoke 'main.main' when executed via command line.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution are present. The use of 'open' for reading 'README.md' is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setuptools setup configuration for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, uses 'find_packages()' to include all sub-packages, and defines a console script entry point. The code does not perform any data processing, network operations, or malicious actions. All functions used are part of the standard setup procedure. No anomalies or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate packaging configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical project setup file with no suspicious behavior.",
