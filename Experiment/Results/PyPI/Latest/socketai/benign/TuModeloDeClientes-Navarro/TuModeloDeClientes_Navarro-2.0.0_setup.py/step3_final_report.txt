  "purpose": "Package setup configuration for 'TuModeloDeClientes_Navarro', defining metadata, package discovery, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, README.md content, and defines entry points for CLI execution.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the 'main:main' entry point, but no malicious or unsafe data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Setup script initializes package info, reads README, and registers CLI command 'TuModeloDeClientes+Navarro' linked to main:main.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual '+' character in the CLI command name; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata, finds packages, and sets an entry point for CLI. The command name includes a plus sign, which is unconventional but not malicious. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The 'main:main' entry point depends on external code, but the setup script itself appears benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal, around 0.1 to 0.2 due to the command name's unusual character. Overall, the code is safe and typical for packaging a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor anomaly is the CLI command name containing a plus sign, which does not pose a security threat. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk. The code is safe for use.",
