  "purpose": "Define classes for customer management and shopping cart functionality, including premium customer with discount features.",
  "sources": "Input data includes customer details (nombre, edad, email, gustos), product names, and quantities. No external data sources or user inputs are directly present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Methods that output data via print statements, mainly for displaying cart contents, purchase confirmation, and total price with discount.",
  "flows": "Customer adds products to cart → views cart → makes purchase → purchase details (including total and discount) are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no use of environment variables, no code injection points, and no external network calls or data exfiltration mechanisms observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages customer data and shopping cart operations locally. It uses simple data structures and print statements for output. There are no suspicious or malicious operations such as network communication, file manipulation, or secret handling. The code's logic is straightforward and does not perform any hidden or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of customer and shopping cart classes with premium features. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident based on static analysis. It is safe from supply chain malware or malicious code injection.",
