  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, managing customer data, shopping cart, and purchase logic.\n- No external data access, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The print statements are used for user interaction, not malicious purposes.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code segments are detected.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1 or 0.2), which seems reasonable given the code's scope.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Malware presence:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The **scores for malware (0)** are consistent and justified.\n- The **security risk scores** are also reasonable, given the code's simplicity.\n- The **confidence levels** are high (0.9 or 1), which is appropriate.\n\n### Potential improvements:\n- None necessary; the reports correctly identify the code as safe.\n- The only minor note is that input validation isn't implemented, but this is typical for such code and doesn't imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, typical for simple code)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
