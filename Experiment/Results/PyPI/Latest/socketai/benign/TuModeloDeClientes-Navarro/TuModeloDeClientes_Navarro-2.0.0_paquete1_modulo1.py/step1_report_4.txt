  "purpose": "Define customer classes for managing shopping cart behavior and purchase processes, including premium customers with discounts.",
  "sources": "Input data for customer details (nombre, edad, email, gustos), product names, and quantities.",
  "sinks": "Printing statements that output cart contents, purchase summaries, and total prices.",
  "flows": "Data flows from customer attributes and product inputs to print statements for cart viewing and purchasing summaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes for managing customer shopping behavior, with methods for adding items to cart, viewing cart, and purchasing. The purchase functions only output purchase details and clear the cart, with no data leaks or malicious actions. The premium customer class adds discount calculations, but all operations are straightforward calculations and prints. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation for customer and shopping cart management. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior detected.",
