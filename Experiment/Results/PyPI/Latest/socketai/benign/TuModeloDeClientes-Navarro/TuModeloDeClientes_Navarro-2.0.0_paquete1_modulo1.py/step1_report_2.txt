{
  "purpose": "Define classes for managing customer data, shopping cart, and purchase behavior in an e-commerce context.",
  "sources": "Constructor methods (__init__), methods that modify attributes (agregar_al_carrito, comprar), and print statements.",
  "sinks": "Print statements output customer actions and purchase summaries; no direct data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Customer inputs (name, email, gustos) flow into object creation; carrito list is modified via agregar_al_carrito; comprar methods read carrito data and output summaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The only potentially unusual aspect is the print statements used for transaction summaries, but this is typical for debugging or logging.",
  "analysis": "The code implements basic customer and premium customer classes with shopping cart functionality. No external data access, network communication, or obfuscation present. Methods correctly handle data without executing untrusted code or revealing sensitive information. The print statements are for user interaction, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of customer and shopping cart classes with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain malware or suspicious behaviors. The use of print statements for output is typical and not indicative of malicious activity.",
