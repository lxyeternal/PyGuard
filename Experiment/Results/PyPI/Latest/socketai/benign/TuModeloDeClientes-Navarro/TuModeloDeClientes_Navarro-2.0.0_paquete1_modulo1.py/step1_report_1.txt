  "purpose": "Define classes for clients and premium clients for an e-commerce system, managing shopping carts and purchases.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for class constructors (nombre, edad, email, gustos, descuento), method calls to agregar_al_carrito, ver_carrito, comprar.",
  "sinks": "Print statements displaying user actions and purchase details; no external data writes or network communications.",
  "flows": "User inputs (client info and actions) flow through methods to generate outputs and modify internal state (carrito).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no use of unsafe functions; no suspicious data handling or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, Cliente and ClientePremium, with methods for managing shopping carts and purchases. The logic is straightforward and typical for such applications. No input validation, sanitization, or external data access is present, but these are not inherently malicious. The print statements serve user interface purposes only. No network, file I/O, or system commands are used that could indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical implementation of client management in an e-commerce context, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It does not contain malware or suspicious logic. It appears safe for use.",
