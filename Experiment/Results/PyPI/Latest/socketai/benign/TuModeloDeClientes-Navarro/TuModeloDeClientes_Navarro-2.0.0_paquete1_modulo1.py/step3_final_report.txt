  "purpose": "Defines Cliente and ClientePremium classes for managing shopping carts and purchases with basic user interaction.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; data is stored in class attributes and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for user feedback; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Method calls flow from cart management to purchase confirmation via print outputs; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements simple classes for customer management with methods for adding items, viewing cart, and purchasing. No external data access, network calls, or malicious patterns are present. The print statements serve UI purposes only. The logic is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Security considerations are minimal, primarily due to lack of input validation, but this does not imply malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The security risk score is appropriately low, reflecting minimal threat in its current form.",
