  "purpose": "Importing classes and functions from local modules for use in the application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules 'modulo1' and 'modulo2'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; simply importing modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements importing specific classes and functions from local modules. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data. The code appears standard for module imports and does not exhibit signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks based on this snippet.",
