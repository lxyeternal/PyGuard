{
  "purpose": "This code performs relative imports of classes and functions from local modules within a package, likely to organize and reuse code components.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing classes 'Cliente', 'ClientePremium' from '.modulo1' and function 'menu' from '.modulo2'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely static import statements with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A - static imports without data flow or runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements from local modules, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence in this assessment. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of import statements with no malicious or security issues. The current scores and assessments are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
