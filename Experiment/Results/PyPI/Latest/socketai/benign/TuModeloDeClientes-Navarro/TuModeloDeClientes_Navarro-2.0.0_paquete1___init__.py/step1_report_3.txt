  "flows": "No data flow observed within this small code fragment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs identified",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple imports from relative modules within the package. There are no functions, data processing, or untrusted input handling present. This is standard practice in Python projects and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is part of a typical package structure for a Python application.",
