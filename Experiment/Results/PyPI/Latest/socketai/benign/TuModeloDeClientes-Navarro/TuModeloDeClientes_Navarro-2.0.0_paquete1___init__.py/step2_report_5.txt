  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code carefully.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .modulo1 import Cliente, ClientePremium\nfrom .modulo2 import menu\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code is simply importing classes `Cliente`, `ClientePremium` from `.modulo1` and a function `menu` from `.modulo2`.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is typical for a Python package structure, with relative imports.\n\n### Evaluation of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, importing local modules/classes/functions.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The confidence score is 1 in all reports, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n- Malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- Security risk is 0, as there are no evident vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that this is standard import code with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n- **Scores and reasoning:**  \n  The scores (confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable. Given the code snippet, there is no reason to adjust these scores.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n  Since the code is purely import statements with no suspicious activity, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n- **Malware considerations:**  \n  No malicious intent or activity is detected. The malware score remains 0.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n  The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that this code alone is benign.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  All scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is standard, safe, and poses no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                       | No malicious activity or behavior detected.                |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                       | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.           |\n| Security Risk    | 0                       | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors evident.             |\n\n**Overall, this is a benign, standard module import snippet with no security concerns.**",
