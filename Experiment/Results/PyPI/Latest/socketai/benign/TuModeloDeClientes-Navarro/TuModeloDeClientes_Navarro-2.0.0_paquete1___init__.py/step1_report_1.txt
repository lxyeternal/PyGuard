{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package or module that imports classes and functions from other modules within the same package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal module files: '.modulo1' and '.modulo2'. No external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network operations, file writes, or execution of untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve importing classes 'Cliente' and 'ClientePremium' and the 'menu' function, with no data processing or transfer observable in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with simple relative imports; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module imports within a package. It does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior, nor does it manipulate untrusted data. The absence of complex logic, input/output handling, or external data sources suggests a benign purpose. The structure and formatting are typical of Python modules, and no anomalies or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import statement, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears safe and typical of a well-structured Python package.",
