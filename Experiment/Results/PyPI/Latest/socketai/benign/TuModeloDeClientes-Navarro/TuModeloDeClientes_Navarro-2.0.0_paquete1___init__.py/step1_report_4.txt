  "purpose": "Import classes and functions from local modules for further use in the application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .modulo1 and .modulo2",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; code only performs imports",
  "flows": "Imports from modulo1 and modulo2 are used elsewhere in the application, no direct flow evident in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, which is standard practice for modular Python code. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. Since this code is just imports, it doesn't contain harmful operations. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard module imports with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project and does not pose any security concerns on its own.",
