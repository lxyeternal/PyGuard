{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a utility script for handling data processing, possibly related to network communication or data transformation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, environment variables, or external configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Data is outputted to files, network sockets, or logs, and some data may be sent via HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters/env vars) through processing functions and then to sinks like files, logs, or network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; no unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Usage of environment variables appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from specified sources such as function inputs and environment variables. It processes this data through transformations or encoding steps. Sinks include writing to files, logging, or network transmissions. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network connections are evident. The structure is straightforward, with clear source-to-sink flow. No anomalies like obfuscated code or hardcoded secrets are present. All third-party library usage is standard and justified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be a benign utility script with standard data handling practices.",
