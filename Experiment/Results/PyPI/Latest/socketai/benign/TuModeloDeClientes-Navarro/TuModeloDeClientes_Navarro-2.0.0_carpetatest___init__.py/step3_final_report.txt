  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, network communication functions, dynamic execution functions ('exec', 'eval'), hardcoded IPs/URLs, environment variables, file I/O.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system, environment variables, dynamic code execution points, data exfiltration channels.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks via functions like 'exec', 'eval', network calls, or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'exec'/'eval' with untrusted inputs, hardcoded suspicious IPs/URLs, obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets in reports 1-4 are straightforward, with no suspicious functions, obfuscation, or network activity, leading to low malware and risk scores. Report 5 exhibits behaviors typical of malicious scripts, including 'exec'/'eval' with untrusted inputs, hardcoded addresses, and potential C2 communication, justifying higher malware (0.6), obfuscation (0.6), and risk (0.7) scores. The assessments are consistent with the described behaviors, and no false positives are evident. The overall evaluation aligns with standard security analysis practices.",
  "conclusion": "Reports 1-4 are benign with appropriate low scores. Report 5 shows suspicious patterns warranting higher scores. The scores are justified and consistent with the code descriptions, indicating a low overall threat level with a notable exception requiring further review.",
