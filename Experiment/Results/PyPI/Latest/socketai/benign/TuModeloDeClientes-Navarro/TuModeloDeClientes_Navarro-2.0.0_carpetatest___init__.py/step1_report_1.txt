{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a module, import necessary libraries, and perform some operations that are typical in Python scripts. Without specific functions or detailed logic, the purpose is unclear but seems to be related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Any data input may come from function parameters, environment variables, or external files if present (not explicitly shown). The code does not explicitly read user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls if any are present in unseen parts of the code, but none are explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flow is evident in the visible code. The code snippet does not demonstrate data passing from input sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or unusual code constructs are evident. The code is straightforward and lacks obfuscated or misleading elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard import statements and function or class definitions with no evident malicious logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The absence of external data reads, unsafe operations, or obfuscated code suggests it is benign. Without additional context or code, there are no suspicious activities or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and safe, with no malicious intent detected. Confidence is high due to the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
