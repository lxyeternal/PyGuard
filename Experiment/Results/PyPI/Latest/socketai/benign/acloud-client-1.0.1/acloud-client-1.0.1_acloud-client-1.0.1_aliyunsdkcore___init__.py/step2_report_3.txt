  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as simply assigning a static string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, network activity, or complex logic.\n   - The original code snippet `__version__ = \"2.14.0\"` is straightforward and standard practice in Python packages.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected in any report.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The assessments are thorough and align with typical Python version declaration practices.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a securityRisk of 0, and the code is a straightforward version string assignment, there is no justification for a higher risk score.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, data handling, or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports agree on malware: 0.\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n   - No change needed.\n\n6. **Claims About Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly state that this is a benign, static assignment.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard version declaration.\n- No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. No further action or concern is warranted for this code snippet.",
