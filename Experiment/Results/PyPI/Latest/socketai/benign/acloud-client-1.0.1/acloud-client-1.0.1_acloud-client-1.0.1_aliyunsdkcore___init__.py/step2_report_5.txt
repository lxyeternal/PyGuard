  "review": "Let's systematically analyze these reports:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports describe a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No input/output operations, network activity, or code execution is involved.\n   - No obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and widely used in Python packages for versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no security concerns.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely static and does not involve any external data or executable logic, raising risk scores would be unjustified.\n   - The malware score remains 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score remains 0, as the code is straightforward and clear.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - None of the reports make unwarranted assumptions; they are cautious and accurate.\n   - They correctly conclude that this is a standard version declaration.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code snippet and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk, as the code is harmless)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, benign version string assignment with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own estimates, they would match the current scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nsince there's no evidence of malicious or risky behavior in this code snippet.",
