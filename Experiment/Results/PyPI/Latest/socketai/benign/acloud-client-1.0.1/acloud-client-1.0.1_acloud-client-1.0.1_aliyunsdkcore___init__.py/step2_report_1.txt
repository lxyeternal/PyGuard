  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe a simple assignment: `__version__ = \"2.14.0\"`.\n   - This is a standard practice in Python packages to declare version info.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, network calls, or logic.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their description.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is minimal, static, and benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n   - No changes needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is just a static version string assignment, there's no basis for a high security risk.\n   - The risk scores are correctly set to 0, indicating no security concern.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This is accurate; the code shows no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions; they state the code is benign.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a straightforward, harmless version declaration.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n  *The code contains no malicious behavior.*\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  *The code is clear, simple, and not obfuscated.*\n\n- **Risk:** 0  \n  *No security risks are present.*\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and no further action or concern is necessary.",
