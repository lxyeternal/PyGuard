  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the issue in the code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a simple assignment: `__version__ = \"2.14.0\"`.\n   - The original code confirms this, and no other code or logic is present.\n   - **Conclusion:** The described issues are accurate; the code is just a version string assignment.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports consistently state that the code is benign, with no input/output, no external data handling, and no malicious behavior.\n   - Given the simplicity of the code, this reasoning is correct.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are apparent in these assessments.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These seem appropriate, as the code is straightforward and harmless.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, indicating no risk.\n   - Since the code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or risky behavior, this is justified.\n   - **Conclusion:** No higher risk scores are warranted here.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - **Note:** The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they simply state that the code is benign.\n   - No unsupported claims are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard version string assignment.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate; no changes are necessary.",
