  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, assess the reasoning, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - All reports describe a single line: `__version__ = \"2.14.0\"`.\n   - The code is a static assignment of a version string to a variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external data, network activity, or executable logic.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity:**\n   - Each report correctly states that this is a standard, benign practice for version declaration.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and accurate; no anomalies or security concerns are detected.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which aligns with the correctness of the assessment.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n   - This is appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The overall risk score is also 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Mistakes:**\n   - No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports. They are consistent and thorough.\n   - The reasoning is sound; no assumptions about malicious intent are made without basis.\n\n5. **Final Justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely a static version string assignment, the malware score should remain 0.\n   - The obfuscated score is correctly 0, as there is no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is correctly 0, given the lack of any security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security concerns.",
