  "purpose": "Assigns version information for the Python package, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the string '__version__' with value '2.14.0'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data, network calls, or input/output operations.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string, common in Python packages. It contains no inputs, outputs, network activity, or executable logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or obfuscation are present, and the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
