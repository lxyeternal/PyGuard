  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Availability of the reported issues in the code:**\n   - The reports contain no details—only \"Empty response\" errors. Therefore, there is no information about any vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or flaws.\n   - Without specific issues reported, I cannot confirm the presence of any security concerns or code flaws.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**\n   - The reports are empty; they do not provide any reasoning, analysis, or evidence.\n   - This lack of information makes it impossible to evaluate or critique the report's conclusions.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - Since no issues are described, any scores assigned are likely arbitrary or default.\n   - Without details, I cannot suggest changes; however, assigning high scores without evidence would be unreasonable.\n\n4. **Risk and malware scores justification:**\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation is provided.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should be low or zero.\n   - Malware score should be zero unless there's proof of malicious behavior, which there isn't.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - Any assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware without evidence are unjustified.\n   - The empty reports do not provide any basis for such claims.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - Since no issues are described, scores should reflect that—likely zero or minimal.\n\n7. **Code review of the provided script:**\n   - The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - The only potential concern is the `install_requires` dependency `'snapshot-photo'`, which I am not familiar with, but that alone does not imply maliciousness or vulnerability.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Code Security:** No issues detected in the code itself.\n- **Reports:** No data to evaluate; all are empty.\n- **Scores:** Should be minimal or zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.\n- **Overall:** No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities based on provided information.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Request more detailed reports or evidence to perform a meaningful security assessment.\n- Current scores should be set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk, given the lack of any reported issues.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nPlease provide more detailed reports for a thorough review.",
