  "purpose": "Declare the version of the Python Universal Framework for Model Version Control (PUF).",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "None; the code only assigns a version string without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a simple static declaration with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and a version string assignment, with no executable logic, input/output, or dependencies. All reports correctly identify its benign, metadata-only nature. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of security concerns. The reasoning is sound, and no further analysis or modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, serving as a version indicator with no security risks or malicious intent. The current assessments and scores are appropriate and accurate.",
