  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the validity of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py configuration script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is identified.\n- The dependencies are common, and the script does not process untrusted input or execute dynamic code.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, dependencies are well-known, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent and justified. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, confirms benign nature, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Standard setup, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate and justified.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, static configuration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Same as others, benign setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable given the static, standard nature of the setup script.\n- The confidence levels are justified at 1.0, given the clear and typical setup code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**These scores align with the analysis and the nature of the code.**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided reports and the code review, **the package setup script is benign, standard, and poses no security risks**. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the detailed analysis.",
