  "purpose": "Define package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers for the Python package 'puf-cli'.",
  "sources": "Static setup configuration data; no runtime input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard setup script with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script using setuptools, specifying package info, dependencies, extras, entry points, and classifiers. Dependencies are common open-source packages, and the script does not execute any dynamic code, handle untrusted input, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or network activity are present. The code is declarative and static, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and align with the analysis. The code is a typical, safe package configuration.",
