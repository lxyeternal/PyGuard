  "purpose": "Define type aliases for UUID columns with different configurations using SQLAlchemy, primarily for database schema definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, uuid, and sqlalchemy modules that provide UUID handling and ORM features.",
  "sinks": "The mapped_column function that creates database column configurations, specifically handling UUIDs.",
  "flows": "UUID variables and functions (uuid4) flow into mapped_column calls which generate database schema definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The use of uuid4 is standard for generating UUIDs. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases for UUID columns with various database properties (default, primary key, index). It imports standard libraries and SQLAlchemy functions. The uuid4 function is used correctly for UUID generation. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to common patterns for database schema setup. No suspicious or malicious activity identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and safe setup for defining UUID columns in a SQLAlchemy ORM model. No malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
