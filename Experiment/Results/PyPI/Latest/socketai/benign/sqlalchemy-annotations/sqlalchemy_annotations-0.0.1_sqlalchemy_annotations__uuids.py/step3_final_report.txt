  "purpose": "Define type aliases for UUID columns in SQLAlchemy models with default UUID generation, primary key, and index options.",
  "sources": "Code imports from typing, uuid, and sqlalchemy modules; usage of uuid4() for default UUID values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that could leak data or execute malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Initialization of UUID default values via uuid4() during schema definition; no runtime data flow involving external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code follows standard practices, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup for defining UUID columns in SQLAlchemy ORM models. It employs safe, cryptographically secure UUID generation with uuid4(). There are no external inputs, no malicious or suspicious code, and no obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code's purpose is schema definition, not execution or data processing, further reducing security concerns. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, and the scoring is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for UUID column definitions in SQLAlchemy models. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk present. The scores are appropriate and require no adjustment.",
