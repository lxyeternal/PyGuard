  "purpose": "Define type aliases for UUID columns in SQLAlchemy models, including default UUID generation and indexing options.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines type aliases and imports modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or cause data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code is only defining type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed. The use of UUIDs with default generation appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines three type aliases for UUID columns with different configurations (default UUID, primary key, indexed). Usage of 'uuid4()' as default is standard for generating new UUIDs. All imported modules are used appropriately. No indications of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The code appears to be a typical setup for SQLAlchemy ORM models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward and standard setup for UUID column definitions in SQLAlchemy. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not contain obfuscation or malware characteristics.",
