  "purpose": "Define type aliases for UUID columns in SQLAlchemy models with default values and indexing",
  "sources": "Imported modules, type annotations, and mapped_column calls setting defaults and primary key/index",
  "sinks": "mapped_column calls where data is configured for database schema",
  "flows": "Imports -> type alias definitions -> mapped_column configurations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of uuid4 for default UUID generation is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases for UUID columns using SQLAlchemy, specifying default UUIDs via uuid4(). It imports necessary modules and applies annotated types with mapped_column configurations for primary key and indexed columns. No external inputs, user data, or network interactions are present. The usage of uuid4() is a common method for generating unique identifiers. The code appears to be purely schema definition with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard way to define UUID columns in SQLAlchemy models. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
