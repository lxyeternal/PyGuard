  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines three type aliases for boolean columns in SQLAlchemy ORM models, with optional default values (`True`, `False`, or none).\n   - It imports `typing.Annotated` and `sqlalchemy` modules, uses `mapped_column` with `Boolean()` type.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic execution, user input handling, or external data processing.\n   - The code appears purely declarative, intended for schema definition.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n   - The code is straightforward and adheres to standard SQLAlchemy practices.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Analysis of Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - Security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1—this seems overly cautious given the benign nature.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1), which is appropriate.\n   - No reports suggest any code behavior that could lead to vulnerabilities or exploits.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Misjudgments:**\n   - The only point to consider is the `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in report 4. Given the code's simplicity and lack of external data handling, this seems unnecessarily elevated.\n   - All other assessments correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n5. **Summary of Findings:**\n   - The code is a standard, safe setup for defining boolean columns in SQLAlchemy ORM models.\n   - No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are present.\n   - The scores assigned are consistent with the code's nature, except perhaps the minor security risk score in report 4, which should be 0.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - The malware scores should remain at 0 across all reports.\n   - The security risk score in report 4 should be adjusted to 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n   - The overall assessment should be that the code is entirely safe, with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely structural, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
