  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code to verify the claims, scores, and any potential issues.\n\n**1. Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines type aliases for boolean columns with default values for ORM models; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Verification:** The code indeed imports `typing` and `sqlalchemy`, and defines three type aliases with `mapped_column` and `Boolean()`, with defaults `True`, `False`, or none.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is accurate; no data flow from untrusted sources, no anomalies, and the code is purely structural.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**2. Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard ORM schema setup, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Verification:** Same as above; code matches description.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; reasoning sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**3. Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard schema definition, no anomalies.\n- **Verification:** Code matches description.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**4. Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Slightly different score for `securityRisk` (0.1), but the report states the code is benign.\n- **Verification:** The code is the same pattern; no dynamic or external data.\n- **Assessment:** The small security risk score seems unwarranted, as the code is purely declarative.\n- **Recommendation:** The `securityRisk` score should be 0, consistent with other reports and the code's nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — more appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is correct; the score for `securityRisk` should be lowered to 0.\n\n**5. Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as others, benign schema setup.\n- **Verification:** Matches the code.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural, defining type aliases for ORM columns.\n- No malicious activity, malware, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The only inconsistency is in Report 4's `securityRisk` score of 0.1, which should be 0 given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 for all reports, as the code poses no security risk.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe schema definition snippet with no security concerns.",
