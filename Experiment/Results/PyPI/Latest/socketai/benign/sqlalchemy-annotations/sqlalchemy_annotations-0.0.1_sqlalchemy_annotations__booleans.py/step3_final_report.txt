  "purpose": "Define type aliases for boolean columns with default values in SQLAlchemy ORM models.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing and sqlalchemy modules; usage of mapped_column with Boolean() type.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or external data sources; purely declarative schema definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only sets up type aliases for ORM columns.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected; straightforward schema setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines three type aliases for boolean columns with optional default values. It contains no dynamic execution, input handling, or external data processing. The code is purely declarative, intended for schema definition. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this benign nature, except for a minor overestimation of security risk in one report, which should be adjusted to zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe ORM schema setup with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature; the only necessary correction is to set the security risk score to 0 in report 4. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
