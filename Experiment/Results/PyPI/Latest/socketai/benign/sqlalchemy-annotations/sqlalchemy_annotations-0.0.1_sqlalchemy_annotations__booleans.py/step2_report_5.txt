  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it defines type aliases for boolean columns with defaults.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None detected. The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1. These are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are present. The code is purely structural.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is consistent with the description; no issues found.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The analysis is correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1. Valid.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard ORM schema definition.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is as described; no issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 1.\n- **Discussion:** The securityRisk score is slightly above zero. Given the code's benign nature, this seems overestimated. The code does not introduce any vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The minor securityRisk might be a default or conservative estimate but isn't justified here.\n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk should be 0, aligning with the benign analysis.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are 0, correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Almost all are 0, except report 4 which has 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, a risk score of 0 is justified across the board.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence that the code is purely structural, standard ORM schema setup, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The only adjustment needed is the securityRisk score in report 4, which should be lowered from 0.1 to 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is safe and free from security concerns.",
