  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code defines type aliases for boolean columns with default values using SQLAlchemy. It is purely structural, with no data flow, input handling, or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected. The report assigns malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, which are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code is straightforward ORM schema setup, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no anomalies or malicious activity. Scores are all zero, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a standard schema definition with no malicious intent or anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is safe, and scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with a note that `securityRisk` is 0.1. This is slightly higher than the others but still very low.\n- **Analysis:** The slight increase in `securityRisk` score appears to be an overestimation, as the code is purely declarative schema setup with no data handling or external inputs.\n- **Recommendation:** The `securityRisk` score should be 0, matching the other reports, unless there's an explicit reason for concern.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same benign schema definitions, no issues.\n- **Assessment:** Scores are appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (`malware = 0`).\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation (`obfuscated = 0`).\n- **Risk Score:** \n  - The only outlier is Report 4, which assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and lack of external data or dynamic behavior, this is an overestimate.\n  - The other reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk, as the code is purely structural and declarative)\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. The only adjustment I recommend is reducing the `securityRisk` score in Report 4 from 0.1 to 0, as there's no evidence of any security concern.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign ORM schema setup.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores should reflect this, with all being zero.",
