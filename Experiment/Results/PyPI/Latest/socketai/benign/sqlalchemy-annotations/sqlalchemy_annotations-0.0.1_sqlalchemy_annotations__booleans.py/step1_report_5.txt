  "purpose": "Define type aliases for boolean columns using SQLAlchemy with default values.",
  "sources": "No external or user input sources; the code only defines type aliases and imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink, as the code only sets up type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code uses standard SQLAlchemy constructs and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines three type aliases for boolean SQLAlchemy columns, with default values specified. It appears to serve as a utility or schema definition. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data handling, or security risks. The code is straightforward, standard, and non-obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign setup for boolean column definitions using SQLAlchemy. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious flows, or security issues detected.",
