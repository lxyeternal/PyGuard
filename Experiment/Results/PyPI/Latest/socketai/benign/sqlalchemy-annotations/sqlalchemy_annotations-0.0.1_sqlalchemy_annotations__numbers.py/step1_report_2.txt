  "purpose": "Define type aliases for SQLAlchemy columns with various primary key, index, and data types for database models.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, sqlalchemy, and sqlalchemy.orm; annotated column definitions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly handles untrusted input or data; it only defines data structures.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this code is purely defining type aliases and column schemas without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and standard for defining ORM models.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes type aliases for different SQLAlchemy column configurations, including primary keys, indexed columns, and different integer types. It uses annotations to tie data types to database column definitions. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated logic. The use of Identity for autoincrement is standard. No input handling or untrusted data processing present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe setup for SQLAlchemy ORM column definitions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
