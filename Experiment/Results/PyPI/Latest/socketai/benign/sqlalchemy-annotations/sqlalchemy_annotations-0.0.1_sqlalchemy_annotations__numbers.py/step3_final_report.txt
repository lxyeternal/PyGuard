  "purpose": "Define type aliases for SQLAlchemy ORM columns with primary keys, indexes, and data types for schema consistency.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only declares static type aliases for ORM column configurations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code is purely declarative schema definitions without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions for ORM columns using SQLAlchemy constructs. It employs standard patterns such as mapped_column, Identity, primary_key, autoincrement, and index. There are no runtime operations, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for schema definitions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of ORM schema aliases with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign, declarative nature of the code. No modifications are necessary.",
