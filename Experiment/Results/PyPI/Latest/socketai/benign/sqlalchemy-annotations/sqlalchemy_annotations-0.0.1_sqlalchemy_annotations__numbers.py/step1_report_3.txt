  "purpose": "Defines type aliases for SQLAlchemy mapped columns with various primary key, index, and data type configurations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from typing and sqlalchemy modules, defining type aliases with mapped_column configurations.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; code only defines type aliases and column configurations.",
  "flows": "Type alias definitions and annotations, no data flow from untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code uses standard SQLAlchemy constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type aliases for different SQLAlchemy column configurations, including primary keys, indexes, and data types. No input or output operations are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are identified. All elements are standard for defining ORM models.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign setup for database column definitions using SQLAlchemy. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
