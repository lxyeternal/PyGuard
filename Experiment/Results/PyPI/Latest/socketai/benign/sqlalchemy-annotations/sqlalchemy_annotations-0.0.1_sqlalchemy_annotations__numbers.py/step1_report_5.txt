{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for SQLAlchemy ORM column configurations to be reused in database models.",
  "sources": "The code imports type annotations and SQLAlchemy column and ORM utilities, but does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to potential vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up type aliases for database schema definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code purely defines schema components.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes type aliases using SQLAlchemy's mapped_column with various configurations for primary keys, indexes, and identity columns. It does not perform any data processing, input handling, or network operations. All usage aligns with standard ORM schema definition practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup of ORM schema aliases for database models, with no malicious behavior or security risks observed.",
