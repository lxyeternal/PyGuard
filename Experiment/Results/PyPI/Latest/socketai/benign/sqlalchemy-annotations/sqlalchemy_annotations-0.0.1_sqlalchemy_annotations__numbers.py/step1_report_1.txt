  "purpose": "Define type aliases for SQLAlchemy mapped columns with various data types and constraints",
  "sources": "Imports from typing and SQLAlchemy modules, annotations for column definitions",
  "sinks": "None; code defines type aliases without executing or processing untrusted data",
  "flows": "Type alias definitions serve as templates; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and consists of type alias definitions for database columns, specifying primary keys, autoincrement, indexing, and identity properties. It uses standard SQLAlchemy patterns without any dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. There are no external data inputs, no network or file operations, and no potential sink points for malicious data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, safe, and designed for schema definitions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks present.",
