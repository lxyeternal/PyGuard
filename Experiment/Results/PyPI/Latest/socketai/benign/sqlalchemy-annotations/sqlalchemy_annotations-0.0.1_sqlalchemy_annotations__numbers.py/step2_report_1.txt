  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of type alias definitions for SQLAlchemy ORM columns.\n- It uses standard SQLAlchemy constructs such as `mapped_column`, `Identity`, `primary_key`, `autoincrement`, and `index`.\n- There are no runtime data flows, no external input handling, no network or file operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- The code appears to be a utility module for schema definitions, not executable logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports conclude that the code is straightforward, standard, and safe. The code matches the description and contains no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The logic and syntax are correct and align with SQLAlchemy best practices.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None. The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks or malware.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct. There are no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All assessments correctly identify the code as non-malicious and purely schema definition.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The reports are thorough and accurate. They correctly identify that this code is purely defining type aliases for ORM columns, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n- The high confidence scores (1.0) are justified.\n\n- The obfuscated scores (0.0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n\nGiven all the above, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n  No malicious activity or code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n  Clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.0  \n  No security risks present.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe set of type aliases for SQLAlchemy ORM schema definitions. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n**Malware: 0.0**  \n**Obfuscated: 0.0**  \n**Risk: 0.0**",
