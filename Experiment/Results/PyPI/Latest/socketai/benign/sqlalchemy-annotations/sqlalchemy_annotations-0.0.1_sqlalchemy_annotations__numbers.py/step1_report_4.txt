  "purpose": "Define type aliases for SQLAlchemy column configurations, including primary keys, indexes, and data types for use in ORM models.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations, no untrusted data handling or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only defines type aliases without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Usage of SQLAlchemy's mapped_column and Identity features appears standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes type aliases for various SQLAlchemy column configurations, primarily for primary key fields with autoincrement and identity. No external data sources, input handling, or insecure operations are present. The use of SQLAlchemy's features is typical and aimed at ORM model definition, not runtime logic or data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward and standard setup for ORM column definitions. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It serves as a type annotation utility for database models.",
