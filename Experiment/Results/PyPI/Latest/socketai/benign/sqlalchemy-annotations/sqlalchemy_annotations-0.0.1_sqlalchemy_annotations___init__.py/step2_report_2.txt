  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is just import statements for various database column classes.\n- No runtime logic, data handling, or external network activity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n- The report correctly concludes that this is a benign module import setup.\n- The assigned scores (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, only import statements.\n- No data flow or processing, no suspicious patterns.\n- The report's conclusion that it’s safe and standard is justified.\n- Scores (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: import statements for schema definitions.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- The conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, just import statements for data columns.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- The conclusion is consistent.\n- Scores are suitable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Identical assessment: standard import statements, no suspicious activity.\n- No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The conclusion and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign module importing schema components.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent and reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely static import statements with no runtime logic, data processing, or external communication.\n- The absence of dynamic code, network calls, or data handling indicates no malicious activity.\n- The structure is typical for a schema or ORM module.\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The code appears entirely benign and standard for its purpose.",
