  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely import statements from internal modules, with no runtime logic or data handling.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate given the evidence.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, only import statements with no data processing.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—simple imports, no runtime logic.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Import statements for schema definitions, no data handling.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Standard import statements for ORM or schema components.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is solely composed of import statements with no runtime data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as there is no obfuscation or suspicious code structure.\n- The security risk score is 0, aligning with the absence of any malicious or vulnerable code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- Since the code only imports internal modules related to database schema definitions, there is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, standard for a schema or ORM setup, with no signs of supply chain security issues.",
