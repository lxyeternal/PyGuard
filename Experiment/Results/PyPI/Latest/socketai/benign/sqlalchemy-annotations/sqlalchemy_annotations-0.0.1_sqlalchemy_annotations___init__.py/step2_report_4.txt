  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code only contains import statements; no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification for risk score:** Zero risk is justified; no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.  \n- **Overall:** The report is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above—only import statements, no data processing or external calls.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Overall:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Again, only imports; no runtime or data flow.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No security risks or malicious behavior.  \n- **Overall:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above—import statements only.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.  \n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern—imports only.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No security concerns.  \n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.  \n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- No evidence suggests any hidden malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.  \n- The code is purely structural, serving as a module that imports various database column classes, typical in ORM or schema definitions.  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and safe.",
