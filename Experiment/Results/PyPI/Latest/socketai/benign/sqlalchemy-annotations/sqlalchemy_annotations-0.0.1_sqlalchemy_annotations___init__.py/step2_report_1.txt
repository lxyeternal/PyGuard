  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements of internal modules defining database column classes.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or input handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be part of a schema or ORM setup, which is typical and benign.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; no issues detected.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** All scores (malware, securityRisk, obfuscated) are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or security risks are evident; the score is reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Confirmed; the code is just import statements.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** Correctly assigned.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zero, fitting the benign description.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Standard import pattern, no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assigned 0; the code is just import statements.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assigned 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** All reports correctly assigned 0; no security risk.\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code snippet, I concur with the assigned scores. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Therefore, my final scores are:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or concern is necessary.",
