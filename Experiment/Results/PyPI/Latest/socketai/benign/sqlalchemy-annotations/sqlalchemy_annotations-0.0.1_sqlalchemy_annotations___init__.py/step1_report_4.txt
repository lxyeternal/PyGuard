{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various column definitions for a database ORM or data validation library, categorizing them by data type.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported module attributes such as BooleanColumn, DateColumn, IntegerColumn, TextColumn, UUIDColumn, etc.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks related to untrusted data handling, network transmission, or system modification within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports data definitions that could be used elsewhere for database schema creation or data validation; no direct data flow or processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hard-coded secrets are present. The code structure is straightforward and typical for such import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, likely part of a larger data modeling or ORM library. No input/output operations, network connections, or security-sensitive functions are present. The pattern suggests a schema or column definition setup, with no suspicious or malicious behavior visible. The absence of dynamic code execution, external data handling, or system modification points to benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of import statements for data column definitions. It poses no security risks, malware, or malicious behavior based on the provided content.",
