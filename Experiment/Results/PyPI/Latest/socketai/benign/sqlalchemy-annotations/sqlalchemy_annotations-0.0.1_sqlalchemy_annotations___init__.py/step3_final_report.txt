{
  "purpose": "This code imports various database column classes from internal modules, likely for schema or ORM definitions.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules (_booleans, _dates, _numbers, _strings, _uuids).",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; only static imports, no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for schema-related classes, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external communication. It is typical for ORM or schema setup modules. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module import pattern for database schema components. There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports and scores are accurate and require no modifications.",
