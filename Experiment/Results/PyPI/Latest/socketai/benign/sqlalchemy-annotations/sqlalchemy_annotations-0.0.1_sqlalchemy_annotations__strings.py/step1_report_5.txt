  "purpose": "Define type aliases for SQLAlchemy column configurations with specific constraints for text fields.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only type alias definitions and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward use of SQLAlchemy's mapped_column with typical parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines several type aliases for text columns in SQLAlchemy ORM models, specifying attributes like default value, primary key, uniqueness, and indexing. All definitions are standard and follow common ORM patterns. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or hidden behavior. No hardcoded secrets or risky constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe setup for defining database column types using SQLAlchemy. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
