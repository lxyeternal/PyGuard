  "purpose": "Define type aliases for SQLAlchemy columns with specific constraints for database models.",
  "sources": "Imported modules from 'typing' and 'sqlalchemy' which are used for type annotations and ORM column definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or affects system behavior; the code only defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as the code only establishes type aliases without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, defining type aliases for ORM columns with no hidden or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Annotated' and 'TypeAlias' to define clear type aliases for different kinds of SQLAlchemy ORM columns. It specifies default, primary key, unique, and indexed text columns. There is no input handling, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution. The structure is simple and typical for ORM model definitions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup for defining ORM column types using SQLAlchemy with no malicious intent or security risks.",
