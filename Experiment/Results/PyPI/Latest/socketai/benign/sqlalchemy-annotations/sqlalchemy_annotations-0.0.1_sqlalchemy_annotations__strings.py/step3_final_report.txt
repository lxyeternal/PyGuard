  "purpose": "Define ORM column type aliases with specific constraints for SQLAlchemy models.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing and SQLAlchemy modules, no runtime data input or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; the code is declarative and schema-focused, with no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A; static schema definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines type aliases for ORM columns with constraints such as default, primary key, unique, and index. It is purely declarative, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code aligns with best practices for schema definitions in SQLAlchemy. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup for defining ORM column types with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The assigned scores are accurate and justified.",
