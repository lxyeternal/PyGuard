  "purpose": "Defines type aliases for SQLAlchemy columns with specific constraints for use in ORM models.",
  "sources": "The code reads from type annotations and SQLAlchemy functions to define column types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "Type aliases are used for defining database columns; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python typing and SQLAlchemy ORM constructs to define column types with specific attributes like primary key, unique, index, and default values. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing is present. The use of type aliases improves code readability and consistency but does not introduce security risks. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, standard definition of SQLAlchemy column type aliases for ORM models. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
