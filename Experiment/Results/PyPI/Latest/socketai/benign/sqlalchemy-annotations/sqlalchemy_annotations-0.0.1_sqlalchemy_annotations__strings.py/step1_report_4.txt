  "purpose": "Define type aliases for various SQLAlchemy text column configurations",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading present in this code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code primarily sets up type annotations for database schema",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink occurs in this static code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists of type alias definitions and import statements, with no suspicious logic or obfuscated constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines four type aliases for annotated string columns with specific SQLAlchemy column configurations, such as default, primary key, unique, and index. All parts are straightforward, using standard SQLAlchemy syntax for ORM model definitions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious operations. The code does not perform any runtime data processing, network activity, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign code snippet for setting up type aliases related to SQLAlchemy columns. There are no indicators of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks present.",
