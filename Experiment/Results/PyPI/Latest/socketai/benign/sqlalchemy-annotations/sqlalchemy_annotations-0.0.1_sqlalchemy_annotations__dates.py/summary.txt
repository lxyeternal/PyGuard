  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for defining date/time columns in SQLAlchemy ORM models. The only flaw is the incorrect import of 'UTC', which should be fixed for correctness. There is no malicious activity or security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1) due to the bug, but not a security threat."
