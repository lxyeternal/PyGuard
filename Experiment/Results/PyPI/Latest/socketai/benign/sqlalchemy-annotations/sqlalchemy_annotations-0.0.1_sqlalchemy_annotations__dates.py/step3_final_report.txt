  "purpose": "Define type aliases for date, time, and datetime columns with optional timezone support and default UTC timestamp, using SQLAlchemy's mapped_column.",
  "sources": "Imports from datetime and sqlalchemy modules, especially the use of datetime.now(tz=UTC) for default timestamp.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines type aliases and column configurations, with no data input/output or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is declarative type alias definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Incorrect import of 'UTC' from datetime module; 'UTC' does not exist in Python's standard library, leading to a runtime error.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up ORM column type aliases with timezone options and a default UTC timestamp. The use of lambda for default timestamp is standard. The main issue is the import of 'UTC', which is invalid and would cause a NameError at runtime. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is straightforward and typical for ORM schema definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for defining date/time columns in SQLAlchemy ORM models. The only flaw is the incorrect import of 'UTC', which should be fixed for correctness. There is no malicious activity or security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1) due to the bug, but not a security threat.",
