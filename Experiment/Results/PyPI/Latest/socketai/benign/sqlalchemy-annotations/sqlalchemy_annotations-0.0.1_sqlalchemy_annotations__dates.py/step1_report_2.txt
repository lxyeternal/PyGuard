  "purpose": "Define SQLAlchemy column types for date, time, and datetime with optional timezone support, including a default UTC now datetime.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or user inputs; code defines type aliases and column configurations for ORM models.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks; only ORM column configurations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only sets up type annotations and column defaults.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda with datetime.now(tz=UTC) is a typical pattern for default datetime; no suspicious or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard datetime modules and SQLAlchemy components. It defines type aliases for date, time, and datetime columns with timezone options. The default value for DateTime includes a lambda function setting default to current UTC time. All code appears to be standard ORM setup without any dynamic code execution, input handling, or potentially malicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for SQLAlchemy ORM models defining date/time columns with timezone support and default UTC timestamp. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
