  "purpose": "Define type aliases for SQLAlchemy column types with specific timezone configurations for date and time fields.",
  "sources": "Imports from datetime and sqlalchemy modules, particularly datetime functions and mapped_column.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "The default lambda function in DateTimeDefaultUtcNowColumn flows from default to mapped_column, setting default timestamps.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'UTC' from datetime import does not exist; likely a typo or mistake, since 'UTC' is not defined in the import. The code uses datetime.now(tz=UTC), but UTC is not imported properly, which could cause runtime errors. No malicious code, but a potential bug.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several type aliases for SQLAlchemy columns with timezone-aware and timezone-naive configurations. It imports 'UTC' from datetime, which does not exist in the standard library, indicating a typo or missing import. The default lambda in DateTimeDefaultUtcNowColumn uses datetime.now(tz=UTC), which will raise a NameError at runtime. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code’s purpose is to streamline database schema definitions, not to perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and intended for defining database column types. It contains a bug due to the incorrect import of 'UTC', but no malicious intent or security issues are evident. The primary concern is a runtime error, not a security threat.",
