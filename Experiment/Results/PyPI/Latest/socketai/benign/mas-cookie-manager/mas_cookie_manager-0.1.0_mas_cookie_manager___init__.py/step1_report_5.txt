  "purpose": "Importing a component called cookie_manager from the local module mas_cookie_manager, likely related to managing cookies in a web context.",
  "sources": "The import statement, which loads code from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points are present in this single-line import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious activity or unusual code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a module import, which is standard in Python. It references a local module named mas_cookie_manager and imports cookie_manager. Without additional context or code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The simplicity suggests no obfuscation or malware presence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It appears to be a normal part of a larger codebase.",
