  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:  \n   All reports are based on a minimal import statement:\n   ```python\n   from .mas_cookie_manager import cookie_manager\n   ```\n   There is no evidence in the code snippet itself of malicious behavior, data processing, or obfuscation. The import is straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement. They do not overstate or understate the potential risks. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Obfuscated score (0)**: Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Malware score (0)**: Correct, since no malicious activity is indicated.  \n   - **Security risk score (0)**: Correct, given the lack of any suspicious behavior or data handling.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports suggest any activity that would warrant a higher risk score. The code is benign, and the context does not imply any hidden malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   Since the code only imports a local module, and there's no indication of malicious payloads or behavior, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign and typical for modular Python projects.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n### Additional Notes:\nGiven the simplicity of the code snippet, there is no evidence to suggest any malicious intent or security risk. The module name \"mas_cookie_manager\" could imply cookie management, but without further code or context, this remains a benign import.\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate and appropriately score the snippet as non-malicious and non-obfuscated. No adjustments are necessary.",
