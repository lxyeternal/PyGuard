  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports are about a simple import statement: `from .mas_cookie_manager import cookie_manager`.\n   - The code snippet is minimal and only performs a local import.\n   - No external input, data processing, or output occurs.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - **Conclusion:** There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors in this code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that this is a benign import statement with no security implications.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they are cautious and accurate.\n   - They acknowledge the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate given the limited code context.\n- The minimal import statement poses no security concern on its own.\n- Without additional code or context, there's no basis for concern.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
