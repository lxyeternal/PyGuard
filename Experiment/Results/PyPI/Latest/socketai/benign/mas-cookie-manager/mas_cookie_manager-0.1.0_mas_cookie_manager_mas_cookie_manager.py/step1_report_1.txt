{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Streamlit custom component for managing cookies, supporting different deployment modes (local development or production).",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration from the _RELEASE variable and the file system to determine the component's URL or path.",
  "falls": "The component function _component_func is called with parameters action, name, value, days, and default, which could potentially handle untrusted input if provided externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (action, name, value, days) flow into _component_func; the output depends on the component's implementation, but there are no explicit source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The URL for development is localhost, which is typical. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a cookie management component, switching between local and production environments based on the _RELEASE flag. The function passes user-provided parameters directly to the component, but since the component's internal implementation is external and not included, potential security issues depend on that component. The code itself does not process or manipulate sensitive data insecurely. No malicious behaviors or anomalies are evident within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a Streamlit custom component with environment-based configuration. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The main consideration is ensuring the external component handles inputs securely.",
