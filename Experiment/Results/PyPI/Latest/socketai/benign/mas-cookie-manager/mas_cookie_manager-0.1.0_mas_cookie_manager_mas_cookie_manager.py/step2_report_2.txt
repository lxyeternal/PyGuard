  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Sets up a Streamlit custom component for cookie management.\n- Switches between local development (`localhost`) and production build directory based on `_RELEASE`.\n- Exposes a `cookie_manager` function that forwards parameters (`action`, `name`, `value`, `days`) to the component.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code relies on external component implementation, which is not included here.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no evident security flaws or malicious behavior.  \n  **Confirmed:** No issues are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is a standard environment-based setup for a frontend component, passing user parameters directly to an external component.  \n  **No flaws are evident** within this code snippet.\n\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and low `securityRisk` scores (~0.1-0.2).  \n  These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis of the Reports:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign **malware = 0**.  \n- The code only declares a component and forwards parameters; no malicious activity or code injection is evident.  \n- **Conclusion:** Malware score is appropriately low.\n\n#### Obfuscated:\n- All reports assign **obfuscated = 0**.  \n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.  \n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscation is correctly scored.\n\n#### Security Risk:\n- The scores are very low (0.1-0.2), which seems reasonable.  \n- The code relies on an external component; if that component is malicious, risks could exist, but within this snippet, no direct issues are visible.  \n- **Note:** The risk scores are appropriately conservative.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Issues or Assumptions:\n- The reports mention that parameters are passed directly to an external component, which could be a concern if the component is malicious or poorly implemented.  \n- However, since the code itself does not process or manipulate sensitive data beyond forwarding, and no suspicious patterns are present, these concerns are external to this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Overall malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0,** given the code snippet.  \n- The current scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Ensure the external component (`mas_cookie_manager`) is from a trusted source, as the security of this setup depends heavily on that component's implementation.\n- No changes needed to the scoring based on this code alone.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n| Score Type      | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                   | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                   | Code is clear, no obfuscation.                                |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1-0.2             | Low, considering external component reliance, but no direct issues. |\n\n**Final note:** The code appears safe and standard for a frontend component setup, with no evident security flaws or malware. The main concern remains the trustworthiness of the external component implementation.",
