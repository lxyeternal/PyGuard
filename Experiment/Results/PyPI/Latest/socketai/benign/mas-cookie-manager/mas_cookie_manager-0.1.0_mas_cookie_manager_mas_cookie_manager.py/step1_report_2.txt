{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Streamlit component for managing cookies, either by running a local development server or loading a pre-built frontend.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable '_RELEASE' and the file system to determine component loading paths.",
  "sinks": "The function 'cookie_manager' passes user-provided parameters ('action', 'name', 'value', 'days') to the component, which could potentially influence cookie behavior.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from 'cookie_manager' flow into '_component_func', which interfaces with either a local server or a build directory, then executes cookie operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a local URL for development ('http://localhost:3001') and loads files from a relative path. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Streamlit custom component for cookie management, switching between a local development URL and a production build directory based on the '_RELEASE' flag. It reads environment/configuration flags, loads files from the filesystem, and exposes a function that passes parameters to the component. No external or untrusted data sources, nor suspicious behaviors, are evident. The code does not perform any network operations, data leakage, or malicious activities. It appears to be a straightforward implementation of a UI component interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a Streamlit custom component, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is used for managing cookies via a frontend component and does not include any harmful or suspicious code.",
