{
  "purpose": "This code is used to declare and utilize a custom Streamlit component for cookie management, either locally during development or via a built frontend in production.",
  "sources": "Reads the environment variable _RELEASE, file system for __file__ and directory paths, and parameters passed to cookie_manager function.",
  "sinks": "Calls to _component_func with parameters including action, name, value, days, which could potentially influence client-side behavior or data.",
  "flows": "Environment variable _RELEASE determines which component URL/path is used. Function cookie_manager passes user-controlled parameters to the component, potentially influencing client-side cookie operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No use of insecure practices. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a component for cookie management, switching between development and production modes based on _RELEASE. It uses standard methods to determine file paths and environment setup. The function cookie_manager forwards user-supplied parameters to the component, which is typical for such UI components. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or insecure practices are present. The code itself appears straightforward and secure in its context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for managing a Streamlit component with no apparent malicious intent or security issues. It primarily handles frontend component declaration and invocation without suspicious logic.",
