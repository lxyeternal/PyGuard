  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Sets up a Streamlit custom component for cookie management.\n- Uses a `_RELEASE` flag to determine whether to load from a local URL (localhost) or from a build directory.\n- Exposes a `cookie_manager` function that forwards parameters (`action`, `name`, `value`, `days`) to the component.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude that the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. This aligns with the code, which is straightforward setup code.  \n  **Yes, the reports are consistent with the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or security flaws?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code simply passes parameters to an external component, with no internal processing or validation.  \n  **No errors or flaws are evident in the code itself.**\n\n---\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is evident.  \n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern due to external component reliance but no direct issues.  \n- **Obfuscated:**  \n  All correctly note no obfuscation.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes, they are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign scores above 0.5, which is appropriate.  \n- The code itself doesn't perform any malicious activity, handle sensitive data insecurely, or have vulnerabilities.  \n- The main concern is reliance on an external component that could be malicious, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Concerns and Assumptions:\n- The reports mention that parameters are passed directly to the component, which could be a concern if the component is malicious.  \n- However, since the component's implementation is external and not included, we cannot evaluate its behavior.  \n- The code itself is benign, and the risk is primarily from the external component.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** Given the reliance on an external component that could be malicious, but no evidence within this code, a cautious but reasonable score would be around **0.2** to **0.3**.  \n- **Confidence in assessment:** High, as the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Risk             | 0.2 - 0.3      |\n\n**The code appears benign and standard, with no internal malicious activity. The primary concern is external dependency security, which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.**",
