{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Streamlit custom component for managing cookies, supporting different environments (development and production).",
  "sources": "Reads the environment variable _RELEASE, file path for the frontend build, and component invocation parameters.",
  "sinks": "Invokes the _component_func with parameters that could potentially be controlled externally, but no untrusted data handling or output to external systems is evident.",
  "flows": "Depending on _RELEASE, loads the component from a URL or local build directory; the cookie_manager function passes action parameters to the component, which may handle cookies internally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious or malicious behavior observed. The only dynamic aspect is loading a local or remote frontend component based on environment variable.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a conditional setup for a Streamlit component. In development mode, it loads from localhost; in production, it loads from a build directory. The cookie_manager function serves as an interface to this component, passing parameters like action, name, value, and days. There are no evident sources of untrusted input other than function parameters, which are passed directly to the component. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. It mainly manages UI component loading and invocation, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a frontend component loader with environment-based configuration. No malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no obfuscated or malicious code found. It is a straightforward implementation for cookie management in a Streamlit app.",
