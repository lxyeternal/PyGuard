  "purpose": "Setup for a Streamlit custom component to manage cookies, switching between local development and production deployment.",
  "sources": "Environment variable _RELEASE, __file__ path, parameters passed to cookie_manager function",
  "sinks": "Parameters forwarded to external component 'mas_cookie_manager'",
  "flows": "Parameters (action, name, value, days) flow from cookie_manager to _component_func, which delegates to external component",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns; straightforward delegation",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Streamlit component based on environment, passing user parameters directly to an external component. No internal processing or sensitive data handling occurs. The external component's security is unknown, but the code itself is benign. No malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup for a frontend component with no internal security issues. The primary concern is trusting the external component, which is outside the scope of this code snippet. Overall, the code is safe, with scores correctly reflecting its benign nature.",
