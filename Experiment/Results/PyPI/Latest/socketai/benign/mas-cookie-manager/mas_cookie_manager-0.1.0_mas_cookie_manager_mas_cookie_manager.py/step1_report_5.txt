{
  "purpose": "Define a Streamlit custom component for cookie management, supporting actions like set/get/remove.",
  "sources": "os.path and __file__ to determine build directory; _component_func invoked with parameters for cookie operations.",
  "sinks": "The _component_func call passes parameters to a frontend component, potentially for execution in the browser or server.",
  "flows": "The function cookie_manager passes user-specified actions and parameters to the frontend component, which executes accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The use of local URLs and build directories is standard for local development.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Streamlit component with different configurations based on the _RELEASE flag. In development mode, it connects to localhost; in production, it loads a built frontend. The cookie_manager function simply forwards actions and parameters to the component. No user input is directly handled here, nor is there evidence of data leakage, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard setup for a web component without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for a Streamlit custom cookie management component with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on the frontend component for cookie operations, which is typical. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
