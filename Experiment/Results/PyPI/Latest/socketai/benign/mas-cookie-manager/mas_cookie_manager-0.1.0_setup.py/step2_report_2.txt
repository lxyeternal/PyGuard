  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The provided code appears to be a standard `setup.py` configuration for a Python package named \"mas-cookie-manager\".\n   - It specifies dependencies, metadata, and package information.\n   - There are no apparent malicious code snippets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns within this setup script.\n   - The only dependency specified is `streamlit==1.43.2`, which is a legitimate package.\n\n2. **Review of Reports:**\n   - All reports are empty, indicating no detailed issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity have been provided for review.\n   - Without specific reports or findings, I cannot confirm any issues, errors, or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Assessment of Scores and Claims:**\n   - Since no reports contain content, there are no claims to evaluate or justify.\n   - The absence of evidence makes it impossible to assign meaningful malware, obfuscated, or risk scores.\n   - Any scores assigned without evidence would be arbitrary and unjustified.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the provided code and the empty reports, there are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is straightforward and follows standard practices.\n   - Without additional information, I would assign:\n     - **Malware score:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n     - **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (code is clear and standard)\n     - **Risk score:** 0.0 (no identified risks)\n\n**Final note:**  \nIf further reports or detailed findings are provided, I can re-evaluate accordingly. For now, the package appears benign and well-structured based on the available data.",
