  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'mas-cookie-manager' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reads README file -> passes metadata to setup() -> installs specified dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file for the long description, specifies a fixed dependency on 'streamlit==1.43.2', and includes standard metadata such as author info, classifiers, and Python version requirements. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious dependencies, or suspicious patterns. The dependency is a legitimate package, and the code structure adheres to common practices. The reports provided are empty, with no detailed findings or claims, indicating no detected vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Given the absence of evidence, the malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The package appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues based on the provided code and reports. All scores should be set to zero or near-zero, reflecting the lack of any detected threats or anomalies.",
