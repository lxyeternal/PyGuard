  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The provided code appears to be a standard `setup.py` configuration for a Python package named \"mas-cookie-manager.\"\n   - The code reads a README.md file for the long description, specifies dependencies, classifiers, and Python version requirements.\n   - There are no obvious malicious or suspicious elements in this code snippet.\n   - The dependencies are explicitly listed, with a specific version of `streamlit` (1.43.2), which is a legitimate package.\n\n2. **Reports Content:**\n   - All reports are marked with \"Empty response\" errors and contain no additional information.\n   - This suggests that the reports did not provide any details about vulnerabilities, malware, or issues related to this package or its dependency.\n\n3. **Assessment of Report Validity and Scores:**\n   - Since the reports are empty, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security flaws.\n   - The absence of details means we cannot confirm any issues, nor can we justify higher risk scores.\n   - The malware score should be zero, as there is no indication of malicious behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be zero, given the straightforward code.\n   - The overall risk score should be minimal, reflecting the lack of evidence.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns and Considerations:**\n   - The dependency `streamlit==1.43.2` is a specific version; if that version has known vulnerabilities, that could be a concern, but as of October 2023, no critical issues are publicly known about this specific version.\n   - The package name and author information seem legitimate; no signs of impersonation or malicious intent.\n   - Without additional details, no assumptions about malicious activity or vulnerabilities can be made.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Code is clean and standard.**\n- **No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities based on provided data.**\n- **Scores should be minimal:**\n  - Malware score: 0\n  - Obfuscated score: 0\n  - Risk score: 0\n\n**Final note:** Given the empty reports, the most reasonable conclusion is that there are no issues to report or score higher. However, continuous monitoring and updates are recommended, especially for dependencies.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nLet me know if further details or analysis are needed.",
