  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The provided code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools.\n   - There are no obvious malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscated or malicious code snippets.\n   - The dependencies are explicitly specified, and the package metadata seems straightforward.\n\n2. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All reports are marked as \"Empty response,\" meaning no specific issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behaviors have been documented.\n   - Without detailed reports, it’s impossible to identify specific flaws, malware, or vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - Since no issues are reported, the malware score should be zero.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be zero, as there's no indication of obfuscation.\n   - The risk score should be minimal, close to zero, given the lack of evidence of any problem.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - Without concrete reports, any assumptions about malicious intent or vulnerabilities would be unfounded.\n   - The package name, author, and email appear legitimate, and no suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the available data, the package seems benign.\n   - The lack of detailed reports prevents any higher risk assessment.\n   - The scores should reflect this, with all being very low or zero.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Score | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score   | 0.0               | No evidence of malicious code or behavior.                  |\n| Obfuscated Score| 0.0             | No obfuscation detected or suggested.                        |\n| Risk Score      | 0.1               | Minimal, given no reports or suspicious activity.          |\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code appears clean and standard.\n- No issues are present in the code.\n- The reports are empty, so no concerns can be derived.\n- The scores should be minimal, reflecting no detected threats.\n\nPlease provide more detailed reports if further analysis is needed.",
