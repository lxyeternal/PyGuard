  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscation but has significant security vulnerabilities due to the embedded API key and lack of input validation. These issues should be addressed to mitigate potential misuse. The malware score is 0, while the security risk score should be around 0.75, reflecting the critical credential exposure."
