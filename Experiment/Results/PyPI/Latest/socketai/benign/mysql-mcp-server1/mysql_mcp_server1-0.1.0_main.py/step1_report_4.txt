{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple main function that prints a greeting message, indicating a minimal script likely intended for informational or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's execution context to determine if it is run as the main program (__name__ == '__main__') and calls main().",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to the console using print(). No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "If executed directly, the flow calls main() which outputs a static message; no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated elements, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward Python program that outputs a static string message when run. It does not process any external inputs, does not connect to databases, networks, or perform any file operations. The use of __name__ == '__main__' is standard practice for script execution. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and serves likely for informational purposes. It poses no security risk or malicious intent based on its current content.",
