  "purpose": "A minimal Python script that prints a static greeting message.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static print statement in main()",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "No data flow; static code execution only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, simple code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a main() function that prints a fixed message and executes it if run as the main module. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, trivial script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It poses no security risk, and the assessments are accurate. No adjustments are necessary; the code can be considered safe.",
  "confidence": 1,
