{
  "purpose": "Initialize and run a MySQL MCP server for database interactions.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'mcp' from a local module, which is used in the main() function to run the server.",
  "sinks": "The 'mcp.run()' method is called, which could potentially be a sink if 'mcp' performs network operations or interacts with external systems.",
  "flows": "Import of 'mcp' -> execution of 'mcp.run()' in main() -> server operation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated logic, no input/output handling shown.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing 'mcp' and executing its 'run' method within main(). No user input, no environment variables, no network or data handling is visible in this snippet. The 'mcp' module's internal implementation is unknown; thus, potential malicious behavior depends on its content. Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward server launcher.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple launcher for a MySQL MCP server, with no apparent malicious behavior or security issues in this fragment. It relies on the 'mcp' module, which is not shown; without inspecting 'mcp', no further security assessment can be made. Overall, the code itself is benign.",
