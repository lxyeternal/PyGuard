  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports `mcp` from a local module `.server`.\n- Defines a `main()` function that calls `mcp.run()`.\n- Exposes `mcp` and `main` via `__all__`.\n- The code is minimal, with no hardcoded credentials, no data input/output, and no suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code itself appears benign; no malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The `mcp` object’s internal behavior is unknown; the security assessment depends on its implementation.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- All reports correctly identify the simplicity of the code and the reliance on the `mcp` module.\n- They uniformly conclude no immediate malicious activity or security risks are visible based solely on this snippet.\n- No assumptions are made about the behavior of `mcp.run()`, which is appropriate given the limited context.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code in this snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal risk given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- Since no suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are observed, higher scores are unwarranted.\n- The scores seem consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The main concern is the `mcp` object, which could contain malicious code or vulnerabilities. However, since the snippet doesn't include its implementation, we cannot evaluate it.\n- The reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about `mcp`.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, based on the code snippet; could be slightly higher if `mcp` is untrusted, but we lack info)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since the code delegates to an external module, which could be a risk if untrusted, but not evident here)\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\nThe reports are consistent and cautious, which is appropriate. Without inspecting the `mcp` module, no further security concerns can be confidently identified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward server launcher.\n- No malicious or suspicious code is present.\n- Scores are reasonable and justified based on the provided snippet.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate; no changes needed.",
