  "purpose": "A server for interacting with MySQL databases through MCP.",
  "sources": "The import of `mcp` from `.server` and the call to `mcp.run()`",
  "sinks": "Potential execution within `mcp.run()`, which is external and not provided",
  "flows": "From import of `mcp` to invocation of `mcp.run()` in `main()`",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; minimal code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, straightforward structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports a `mcp` object from a local module, defines a `main()` function that calls `mcp.run()`, and exposes `mcp` and `main`. The code is minimal and appears benign. The security assessment depends on the implementation of `mcp`, which is not provided. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the simplicity of the code and reliance on an external module. Without inspecting `mcp`, no definitive malicious activity can be concluded, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward server launcher with no inherent security issues or malicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate given the minimal and clear code snippet. The primary concern is the behavior of the external `mcp` module, which requires separate review. Overall, the code itself is benign.",
