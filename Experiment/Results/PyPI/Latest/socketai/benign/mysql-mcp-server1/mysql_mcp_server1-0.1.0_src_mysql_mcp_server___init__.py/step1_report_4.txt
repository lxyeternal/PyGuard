{
  "purpose": "Defines a module for running a MySQL MCP server, providing a main entry point to execute the server.",
  "sources": "Imports 'mcp' from a local module 'server'. No other input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'mcp.run()' which likely starts the server; the actual sink is the server process execution.",
  "flows": "From importing 'mcp' to executing 'mcp.run()', which initiates server operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal, straightforward, and lacks suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module and exposes a 'main' function to run the server. There are no user inputs, environment variables, or external data handling within this snippet. The 'mcp.run()' call is a standard way to start server processes. Since the actual implementation details of 'mcp' are not provided, no malicious behavior can be inferred from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple entry point for starting a MySQL MCP server, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign module with standard structure.",
