  "purpose": "Set up and run a MySQL MCP server interface",
  "sources": "Import from relative module .server, specifically mcp object",
  "sinks": "Calling mcp.run() method",
  "flows": "Import -> mcp.run() method execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; simple import and function call",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'mcp' object from a local module '.server' and defines a main() function that executes mcp.run(). There are no hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or data input/output operations. The code appears to be straightforward setup logic for a server component, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal setup for starting a MySQL MCP server. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. It relies on the imported mcp object, which may contain further logic, but based solely on this snippet, it appears benign.",
