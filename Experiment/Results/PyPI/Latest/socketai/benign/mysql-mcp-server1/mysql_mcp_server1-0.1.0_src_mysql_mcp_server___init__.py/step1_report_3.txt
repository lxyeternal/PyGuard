{
  "purpose": "Provides a script to run a MySQL MCP server for database interactions.",
  "sources": "Import from .server module, specifically the 'mcp' object.",
  "sinks": "Calling mcp.run() function, which likely starts server operations.",
  "flows": "The script imports 'mcp' and invokes its 'run' method to initiate server processes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code constructs, no suspicious functions or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'mcp' object from a local module, then defines a main function that executes 'mcp.run()'. There are no user inputs, environment variable manipulations, or network operations directly visible. The '__all__' declaration indicates intended public interface. Without access to the implementation of 'mcp', we cannot evaluate whether 'mcp.run()' performs malicious actions; however, based solely on this code, it appears to be a straightforward server startup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal entry point for running a MySQL MCP server, with no evident malicious intent or security risks within this snippet. It primarily delegates server operations to the 'mcp' object. No suspicious behaviors or security issues are detected at this level.",
