  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of asynchronous functions that open a WebSocket connection to `ws://127.0.0.1:7777`.\n- Each function constructs a protobuf message, serializes it, and sends it over the WebSocket.\n- No responses are processed; only outgoing messages.\n- Input parameters are directly embedded into protobuf messages.\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present.\n- The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors.\n- The communication is strictly local (localhost).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**Presence of issues in code:**\n- The code appears straightforward; no malicious behaviors or anomalies.\n- The only potential concern is that functions open a new WebSocket connection each time, which is inefficient but not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n**Logical flaws or mistakes:**\n- In `setTeamName`, the protobuf field is misspelled: `teanId` instead of `teamId`. This is a clear bug that would prevent proper message serialization.\n- The rest of the code appears syntactically correct and consistent.\n\n**Scores for malware, obfuscated, and risk:**\n- All reports assign malware score = 0, obfuscated = 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2). These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Risk justification:**\n- The code's purpose is to control a game lobby via local WebSocket, which is inherently not malicious.\n- However, if misused, it could manipulate game sessions, but this is typical for such tools.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2), justified by the fact that if untrusted input is supplied, it could manipulate game states. But no malicious intent is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Critical issues identified:\n\n- **Typo in `setTeamName`:** The protobuf field `teanId` should be `teamId`. This is a bug, not a security concern but affects functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Update the `setTeamName` function** to correct the typo:\n  ```python\n  request.customMatch_SetTeamName.CopyFrom(events_pb2.CustomMatch_SetTeamName(teamId=team_id, teamName=team_name))\n  ```\n- **Potential optimization:** Reuse WebSocket connections instead of opening a new one per call, but this is not a security issue.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (small risk due to untrusted input handling and local control, but no significant security flaw)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward local WebSocket API for game lobby manipulation, with no malicious intent or malware. The only flaw is a typo in `setTeamName`, which should be fixed for proper functionality. The security risk is minimal and justified.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions.**",
