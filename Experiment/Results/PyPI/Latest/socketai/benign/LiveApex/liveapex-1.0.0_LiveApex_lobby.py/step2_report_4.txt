  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code interacts solely with a local WebSocket server at 'ws://127.0.0.1:7777'.\n- No external network activity, hardcoded credentials, or secrets are present.\n- The functions construct protobuf messages based on user input parameters, serialize, and send them over WebSocket.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- Repeated pattern of establishing a new WebSocket connection per function call, which is inefficient but not malicious.\n- No response handling or data exfiltration observed.\n- The purpose appears to be for game lobby manipulation, likely for modding or automation.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, citing no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, noting no obfuscation.\n\n**Security Risk Scores:**\n- Slight variation, mostly around 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal concern about misuse if parameters are untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- No issues are identified in the code itself. The code is straightforward and well-structured for its purpose.\n\n### Logical or Reasoning Flaws:\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports. They all correctly interpret the code's behavior as benign.\n\n### Score Reasonableness:\n- The assigned malware scores of 0 are appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n- Obfuscation scores of 0 are justified.\n- Security risk scores are low, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Justifications for Scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- Given the code's purpose and behavior, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:\n- The reports acknowledge that if parameters are untrusted, misuse could occur (e.g., sending malicious data). However, this is a typical concern with any API that accepts user input.\n- No assumptions of vulnerabilities are made beyond the scope of the code's functionality.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's behavior.\n- The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified.\n- Slightly higher security risk scores reflect potential misuse, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n**Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, primarily related to potential misuse if parameters are untrusted.\n\n**Note:** While the code itself appears benign, its capability to manipulate game lobbies could be misused in unauthorized contexts, but that doesn't constitute malware or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a legitimate API wrapper for local game lobby management with no malicious intent. The low scores are justified, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to potential misuse, but not inherently risky)\n\nProceed with these assessments, emphasizing that the code is benign but could be misused if parameters are untrusted.",
