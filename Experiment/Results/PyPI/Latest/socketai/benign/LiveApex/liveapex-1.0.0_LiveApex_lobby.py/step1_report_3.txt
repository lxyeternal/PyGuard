{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of asynchronous functions to interact with the Apex Legends custom match lobby via WebSocket communication, enabling actions like sending chat messages, toggling pause, creating/joining/leaving lobbies, and modifying game settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters (e.g., text, lobby_code, team_id, bans), environment variables are not used, and it constructs protobuf messages for WebSocket communication.",
  "sinks": "The untrusted data flows include serialized protobuf messages sent over WebSocket connections to localhost (ws://127.0.0.1:7777), which could affect game state or lobby configuration if manipulated maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters through protobuf message construction, serialization, and is transmitted via WebSocket to localhost, impacting game lobby and match settings.",
  "anomalies": "The code opens a WebSocket connection for each function call without validation, but there are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. All actions seem aligned with intended lobby manipulations. No suspicious code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple asynchronous functions that interact with a local WebSocket server for game lobby control. Each function constructs specific protobuf messages based on parameters and sends them over a WebSocket connection. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or reverse shells. The use of protobuf messages for lobby manipulation appears legitimate for game modding or automation purposes. The code does not contain obfuscated patterns, hidden backdoors, or unauthorized network activity outside localhost communication. All flows are consistent with intended game lobby management functionalities. No anomalies indicating malicious sabotage or malware are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing Apex Legends custom lobbies via WebSocket communication, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It solely interacts with a local server for game modifications. No security risks or malware indicators detected.",
