{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to interact with a game lobby via WebSocket, enabling actions such as chat messaging, lobby management, player management, and game settings adjustments in a gaming environment.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters (e.g., text, lobby_code, team_id, etc.) and uses fixed WebSocket URI ('ws://127.0.0.1:7777') to send data.",
  "sinks": "Sends serialized protobuf messages over WebSocket connections to a local server; potential for misuse if parameters are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., text, lobby_code, team_id) are embedded into protobuf requests, serialized, and transmitted via WebSocket to localhost; no external or untrusted network sources observed.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated pattern of opening a WebSocket connection for each call without reuse; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; code does not include obfuscated or suspicious language features; no hidden backdoors or stealth behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly facilitates interaction with a local game server via WebSocket using protobuf messages. Each function constructs a specific protobuf request based on input parameters, serializes it, and sends it to a fixed local address. No data is read from untrusted sources or external network endpoints. Functions like 'setLegendBan' or 'setDropLocation' accept user input but only transmit that data to localhost. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. The repeated connection pattern could be inefficient but not malicious. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious code is present. The code appears to be a utility for game lobby manipulation, likely intended for use with a game client or modding tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of local WebSocket interactions for game lobby management, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It could be misused if provided untrusted parameters, but itself does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
