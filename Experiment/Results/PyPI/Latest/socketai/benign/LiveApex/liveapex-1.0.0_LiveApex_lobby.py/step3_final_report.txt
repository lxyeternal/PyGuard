{
  "purpose": "The code provides an API for manipulating a local game lobby via WebSocket connections, sending protobuf messages based on user input to control lobby features such as chat, team settings, lobby creation, and game start.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters from function arguments, constructs protobuf messages, and establishes WebSocket connections to 'ws://127.0.0.1:7777' to send serialized messages.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the WebSocket connection to localhost where protobuf messages are sent; no external network activity or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are embedded into protobuf messages which are serialized and sent over a new WebSocket connection for each function call, with no response handling or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The only notable issue is a typo in 'setTeamName' where 'teanId' should be 'teamId'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of asynchronous functions that open a WebSocket connection to localhost, construct protobuf messages based on parameters, serialize, and send them. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external network activity is detected. The repeated pattern of opening a new connection per call is inefficient but not malicious. The typo in 'setTeamName' affects functionality but not security. Overall, the code appears to be a utility for local game lobby control, with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, local utility for game lobby management, with no malicious intent or activity. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are justified. The only necessary correction is fixing the typo in 'setTeamName'.",
