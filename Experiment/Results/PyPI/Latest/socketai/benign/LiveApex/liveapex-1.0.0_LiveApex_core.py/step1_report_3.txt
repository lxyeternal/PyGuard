{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to start a WebSocket server and listen for events, decode socket events, and process game-related messages.",
  "sources": "Reading environment paths, starting subprocess for server.py, WebSocket message reception, protobuf message parsing",
  "sinks": "Running server.py as a subprocess, network communication over WebSocket, decoding protobuf messages",
  "flows": "Starting subprocess -> reading stdout/stderr -> WebSocket connection -> receiving messages -> decoding protobuf messages -> callback processing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No suspicious network connections or data exfiltration observed. Use of subprocess to run server.py could be misused if server.py is malicious, but the current code simply executes an existing script. No obfuscation or unusual code structures. No data leaks or privacy violations evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages subprocess execution of a server script and WebSocket communication for game event handling. It reads from environment paths dynamically, manages subprocess output streams asynchronously, and decodes protobuf messages. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are directly evident. The subprocess execution could be a vector if the script being run is malicious, but the code itself does not include malicious logic. The WebSocket handling appears straightforward and intended for legitimate event processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, focusing on WebSocket server management and protobuf message decoding. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration within this code snippet. Its potential risk depends on the content of 'server.py', which is external and not analyzed here. Overall, the code itself seems safe.",
