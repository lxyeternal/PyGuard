  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears benign, with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the external execution of server.py from site-packages, which could be malicious if compromised. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, but the security risk should be elevated to reflect the supply chain risk associated with executing external scripts, approximately 0.4. Proper validation or sandboxing of external scripts would mitigate this risk."
