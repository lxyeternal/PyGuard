{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to start and manage a WebSocket server and listener for the LiveApex application, decoding socket events into Python dictionaries.",
  "sources": "os.path.join for path construction, asyncio.create_subprocess_exec for subprocess execution, websockets.connect for WebSocket communication, and protobuf parsing for message decoding.",
  "sinks": "None directly—no data is sent to untrusted external entities or saved insecurely; the subprocess output is printed, and messages are processed internally.",
  "flows": "Subprocess executes server.py, output streams are read and printed; WebSocket messages are received and decoded into dictionaries for callback processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The subprocess management and decoding logic appear standard and appropriate for intended use.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes subprocess execution for server.py located in the site-packages directory, managing its output streams asynchronously. It also establishes WebSocket connections to localhost and processes incoming protobuf-encoded messages, decoding them into dictionaries with specific handling for response types. Error handling is present, and no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or credential misuse are evident. Usage of third-party libraries (websockets, protobuf) is standard, and no obfuscation or hidden code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a WebSocket server and client for internal communication within the LiveApex application. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified based on the provided code. The implementation is straightforward and does not exhibit signs of tampering or sabotage.",
