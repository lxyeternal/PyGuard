{
  "purpose": "This code implements a simple WebSocket server that broadcasts messages received from clients to all connected clients, primarily intended for real-time communication within the LiveApex library.",
  "sources": "The code reads incoming messages from WebSocket clients within the 'echo' function's async for loop.",
  "sinks": "The server sends messages back to clients using 'client.send(message)' within asyncio tasks, which could potentially be exploited if untrusted data is maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Incoming messages from clients (sources) are received in the 'async for message in websocket' loop and then broadcasted to all clients via 'client.send(message)' (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code structures. The exception handling for 'OSError' specifically checks for a port conflict but is standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious imports beyond 'asyncio' and 'websockets'.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a WebSocket server listening on localhost port 7777, broadcasting any received message to all connected clients. It manages client connections in a set, adding on connect and removing on disconnect. Exception handling is in place for port conflicts. The use of asyncio for concurrency appears standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All data flows are internal, with no external network connections or data leaks evident. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward WebSocket server with typical behavior for message broadcasting. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks based on its current content. It operates solely on localhost and does not appear to perform any harmful actions.",
