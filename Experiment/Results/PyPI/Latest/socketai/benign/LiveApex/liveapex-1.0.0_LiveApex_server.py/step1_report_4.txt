{
  "purpose": "To implement a simple WebSocket server that echoes messages to all connected clients for the LiveApex library.",
  "sources": "The code reads incoming WebSocket messages within the async for message in websocket loop.",
  "sinks": "The code sends messages to all connected clients via client.send(message). No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly present beyond WebSocket messages.",
  "flows": "Incoming messages from clients (source) are broadcast to all connected clients (sink) within the echo function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. No use of insecure environment variables, unsafe SQL, or random number generation. The code is straightforward, primarily server setup and message broadcasting.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a WebSocket server listening on localhost (127.0.0.1) at port 7777. It maintains a set of connected clients and broadcasts any received message to all clients. Exception handling addresses the case where the port is already in use. The code uses asyncio and websockets libraries in a standard manner. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code appears to be a typical echo server implementation intended for local communication within the LiveApex library context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign WebSocket echo server with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard operations without malicious patterns or supply chain attacks.",
