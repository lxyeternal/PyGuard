{
  "purpose": "This code implements a simple WebSocket server that echoes messages to all connected clients, likely intended for real-time communication or broadcasting within an application.",
  "sources": "The code reads incoming messages from connected WebSocket clients via 'async for message in websocket'. It also reads environment or system error messages during the server startup, particularly from the exception handling during 'websockets.serve'.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data back to clients using 'client.send(message)', which could potentially send untrusted data received from clients to all other clients. No other sinks such as file writes, network calls to external domains, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Input from clients (messages received) flows through to be broadcast to all connected clients via 'client.send'. During startup, error messages related to socket binding are processed to detect if an instance is already running.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. The server does not connect to external systems or perform unusual actions. The exception handling checks for specific OS error codes but does not perform any malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a WebSocket server on localhost port 7777, broadcasting received messages to all clients. It includes exception handling for address conflicts. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity is evident. Usage appears standard for a local WebSocket server with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward WebSocket echo server intended for local communication. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. It functions as a simple message broadcasting server without external data leaks or harmful actions.",
