{
  "purpose": "This code implements a WebSocket server for LiveApex, enabling real-time message broadcasting among connected clients.",
  "sources": "The code reads incoming messages from WebSocket clients within the 'echo' function via 'async for message in websocket'.",
  "sinks": "The broadcast of messages to all connected clients via 'client.send(message)' potentially exposes data to all clients, but no external or untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input from WebSocket clients (messages) flows through the 'echo' handler and is broadcast to all connected clients, including the sender.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The server listens only on localhost ('127.0.0.1') and a fixed port (7777). No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a local WebSocket server that accepts connections and broadcasts received messages to all clients. It manages connections using a set and handles connection exceptions gracefully. The server binds to localhost, limiting remote access. No external data sources, credentials, or sensitive data handling observed. No suspicious or malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a local WebSocket server for message broadcasting with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is designed for internal use on localhost and does not include any suspicious behaviors or malicious payloads.",
