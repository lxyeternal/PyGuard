  "purpose": "A simple WebSocket echo server listening on localhost for internal testing or development purposes.",
  "sources": "WebSocket messages received from clients",
  "sinks": "Broadcasted messages to all connected clients",
  "flows": "Incoming messages from clients are broadcasted to all clients",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward WebSocket server that manages client connections, broadcasting received messages to all clients. It binds only to localhost, reducing external attack surface. No external data sources, malicious network activity, or system modifications are present. Exception handling is standard. The code is transparent, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward WebSocket echo server intended for local use, with no malicious activity or security issues detected. The current scores accurately reflect its low risk profile.",
