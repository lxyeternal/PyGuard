  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a simple WebSocket echo server listening on localhost (127.0.0.1) at port 7777.\n- It manages client connections in a set, broadcasting received messages to all connected clients.\n- No external inputs beyond WebSocket messages.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns.\n- Exception handling for port conflicts is standard.\n- No obfuscation, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration is evident.\n- The server is intended for local use only, reducing attack surface.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 1\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- malware: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- The report correctly identifies the server as benign, with no malware.\n- The security risk score of 0.2 seems somewhat high for a local-only echo server with no known vulnerabilities. It could be lowered to 0.1 or 0, considering the limited scope and environment.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n- Reduce securityRisk to 0.1, reflecting minimal risk in a local environment.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 2\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- malware: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- Same as above; no malicious activity detected.\n- The broadcast of messages could be exploited if clients send malicious data, but this is inherent in echo servers and not a specific security flaw.\n- The score seems appropriate, but again, the risk is minimal given the server runs only locally.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n- Lower securityRisk to 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 3\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- malware: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- Same reasoning applies.\n- The server's local scope limits potential attack vectors.\n- No malicious code or backdoors.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n- Reduce securityRisk to 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 4\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- malware: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- Same as previous reports.\n- No external dependencies or suspicious code.\n- The server's purpose is benign.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n- Lower securityRisk to 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 5\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- malware: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.1\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- Slightly lower securityRisk score (0.1) is appropriate given the server runs only on localhost.\n- No malicious intent or activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scores:**\n\n| Report | malware | obfuscated | securityRisk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.1          |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.1          |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.1          |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.1          |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.1          |\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly inflated at 0.2; given the server's local-only operation, a score of 0.1 is more appropriate.\n\n**Note:** No issues are present in the code, and the environment limits potential attack vectors.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, straightforward WebSocket echo server intended for local use. The scores should reflect minimal security risk and no malware presence.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and limited scope.",
