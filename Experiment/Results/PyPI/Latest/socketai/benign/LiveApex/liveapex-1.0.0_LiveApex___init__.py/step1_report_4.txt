{
  "purpose": "The code imports three modules: Core, Lobby, and Translator, likely to be used elsewhere in the package for core functionality, lobby management, and translation features.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports from relative package modules: .core, .lobby, .translator.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, user input, or external communication are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible from this minimal snippet, as it only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of import statements for three modules within the same package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code. No input/output operations, no environment variable manipulations, and no code execution or network activity are visible. The code is simple and standard for modular Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import code snippet, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be a standard part of a larger package structure.",
