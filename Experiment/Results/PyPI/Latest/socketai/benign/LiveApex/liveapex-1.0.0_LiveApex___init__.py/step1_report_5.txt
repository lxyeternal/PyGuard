  "purpose": "This code imports three modules: Core, Lobby, and Translator, likely for a larger application to organize functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the package, which may load additional code or dependencies",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output points are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "The code potentially facilitates access to classes Core, Lobby, and Translator; no data flows or untrusted input processing shown",
  "anomalies": "Only import statements; no suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected",
  "analysis": "The snippet consists solely of import statements from local modules. No input, data processing, or untrusted data handling occurs here. The code structure is straightforward and typical for modular Python projects. Since only imports are present, there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. No anomalies or malicious indicators are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement module, with no malicious activity or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a larger, benign project setup.",
