  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of static import statements from local modules (.core, .lobby, .translator).\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, data handling, or external input processing.\n   - No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and contains no malicious or security-related issues.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as standard import statements with no security concerns.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - **Note:** The reports assign a malware score of 0 and very low security risk scores, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 or 0.1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** The small `securityRisk` scores (0.1) seem to be a conservative placeholder; since there's no security concern, they could be set to 0 for clarity.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports justify a risk score above 0.5, and given the code's simplicity, such a high score would be unwarranted.\n   - **Conclusion:** All risk scores should remain at 0 or very close to it.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n\n6. **Claims About Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid speculative claims; they correctly identify that import statements alone do not pose security risks.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The only minor inconsistency is the `securityRisk` scores being slightly above zero; these could be uniformly set to 0 for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is purely import statements with no dynamic or external interactions.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The scores should reflect the benign nature, thus all should be zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is standard, safe, and free of security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate, with minor room for adjustment to reflect zero risk more explicitly.",
