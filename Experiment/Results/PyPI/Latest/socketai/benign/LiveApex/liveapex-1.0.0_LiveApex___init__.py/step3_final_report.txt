{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules Core, Lobby, and Translator from the current package, likely to use their functionalities in the larger application.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.core, .lobby, .translator).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data handling or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The code only imports modules; there are no data flows, source-to-sink paths, or dynamic behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of these import statements. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the security risk scores are minimal, reflecting no security concerns. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only standard import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores should be set to malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0, accurately reflecting its safe nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
