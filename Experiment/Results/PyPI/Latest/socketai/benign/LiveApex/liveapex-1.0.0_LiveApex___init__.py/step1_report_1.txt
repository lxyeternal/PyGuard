  "purpose": "Importing modules Core, Lobby, and Translator from the current package",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package directory",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external output observed",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling; imports are static references",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no unusual code constructs, and no malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing specific modules from the same package. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of external or untrusted input. The structure is straightforward and standard for Python modules. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent based on these imports alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard module import statements with no indication of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs no harmful actions and is typical for modular Python projects.",
