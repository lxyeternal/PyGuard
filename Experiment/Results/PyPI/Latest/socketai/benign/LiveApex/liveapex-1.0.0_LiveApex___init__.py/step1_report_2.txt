  "purpose": "Import statements for modules Core, Lobby, and Translator, likely part of a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data sources and sinks, as these are simple import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; only module imports with relative paths, standard for Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for local modules. There is no input handling, data processing, or execution logic present that could be exploited. The imports suggest modular design but do not in themselves pose security risks. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident from these lines. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only import statements of internal modules, with no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. It appears to be standard package setup code.",
