  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the descriptions.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a set of static dictionaries and functions to translate between internal identifiers and human-readable names for maps, weapons, and datacenters.\n- Functions perform straightforward dictionary lookups with exception handling for unknown entries.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code appears to be a benign utility for data normalization.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No. The code matches the descriptions; all functions and dictionaries are consistent and straightforward.\n\n- **Malicious behavior?**  \n  None detected. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports are consistent: all describe static dictionary lookups with exception handling, no suspicious patterns, and no external dependencies.\n- No errors or flaws in reasoning are evident; the reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Confidence:**  \n  All reports have high confidence (1), justified by the straightforward analysis.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code does not include any hidden or dynamic behaviors.\n- Exception handling is standard.\n- The dictionaries are static and do not pose security risks.\n- No signs of backdoors, code injection, or external data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a simple, static translation utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is well-structured, transparent, and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the existing scores and assessments. The code is benign, and there are no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code analysis.",
