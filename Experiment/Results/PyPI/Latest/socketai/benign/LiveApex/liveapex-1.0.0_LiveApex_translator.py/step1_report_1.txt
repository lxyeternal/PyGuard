{
  "purpose": "The code provides translation functions to convert between internal identifiers and user-friendly common names for maps, weapons, and datacenters, primarily for data normalization and presentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as datacenter, weapon, map, and their respective translation dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "The functions return translated strings or raise exceptions for unknown entries. No direct data leak or external effect is observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are checked against translation dictionaries. Valid entries are translated and returned; invalid entries cause exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, using simple dictionary lookups. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static dictionaries for mappings and untranslations. The functions perform direct lookups with error handling via exceptions, with no dynamic code execution, external network activity, or data manipulation beyond translation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The structure is clean and predictable, serving a translation utility purpose without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign translation utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs simple, safe dictionary lookups to convert data between internal and common naming conventions. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
