{
  "purpose": "Provide translation functions for internal and common names of maps, weapons, and datacenters used in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Constant dictionaries defining mappings and the methods within the Translator class accessing these dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written to external systems or transmitted over networks. No untrusted input is used directly in security-critical operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; functions perform lookups within predefined static dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward mapping logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Exception handling is simple and descriptive.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises static mappings and a Translator class with methods translating between internal and common naming conventions for datacenters, weapons, and maps. All translations rely solely on predefined dictionaries with no dynamic or external input affecting control flow. The methods check dictionary membership and raise exceptions if entries are missing, which is standard. No code injection, external data handling, or malicious operations are present. The code appears benign and solely aimed at data translation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign translation utility with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It is well-structured and uses static dictionaries for data mapping, with no external dependencies or untrusted data processing.",
