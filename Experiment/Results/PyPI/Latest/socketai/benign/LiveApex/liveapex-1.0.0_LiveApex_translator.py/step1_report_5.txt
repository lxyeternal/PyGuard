{
  "purpose": "This code provides translation functions for converting internal game data identifiers to human-readable names and vice versa, specifically for maps, weapons, and datacenters in the game LiveApex.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data when functions are called with map, weapon, or datacenter identifiers or names to translate or untranslate them.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could come from user input or external data sources, but the functions themselves only perform lookups in predefined dictionaries and raise exceptions if unknown data is encountered.",
  "flows": "Input data is received via function parameters, checked against dictionaries, and either returned as translated/untranslated strings or cause exceptions to be raised if not found.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The dictionaries are static mappings, and the functions are straightforward lookups with exception handling. No code executes dynamic code or interacts with external systems.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static lookup functions for data translation between internal identifiers and human-readable names. All mappings are explicitly defined in dictionaries. The functions perform simple existence checks and raise exceptions for unknown inputs, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present. Overall, the code appears purely functional for its intended purpose without security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely provides translation utilities with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses static dictionaries for lookups and standard exception handling. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
