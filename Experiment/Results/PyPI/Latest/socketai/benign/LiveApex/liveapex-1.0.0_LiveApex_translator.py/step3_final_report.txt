{
  "purpose": "The code provides static dictionaries and functions to translate between internal identifiers and human-readable names for maps, weapons, and datacenters, facilitating data normalization within a larger system.",
  "sources": "Dictionary lookups within translate and untranslate functions for datacenters, weapons, and maps.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising on unknown entries; no external data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (internal or common names) are used to perform dictionary lookups, resulting in translated names or exceptions if unknown.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; straightforward static data access.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static dictionaries for bidirectional translation between internal and common names for maps, weapons, and datacenters. The Translator class provides methods for translating and untranslating these entities via dictionary lookups with exception handling for unknown entries. The code is free of dynamic execution, network activity, obfuscation, or external dependencies. All signals point to a benign utility designed for data normalization. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected, and the code's structure is transparent and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static translation utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as benign, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
