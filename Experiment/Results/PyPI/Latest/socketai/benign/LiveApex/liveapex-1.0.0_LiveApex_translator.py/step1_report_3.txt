{
  "purpose": "The code provides translation functions between internal identifiers and human-readable names for maps, weapons, and datacenters used in a game context.",
  "sources": "The functions read input data through parameters (datacenter, weapon, map) that are provided by external callers.",
  "sinks": "The functions return translated strings based on lookup tables; potential sinks include the return statements where the translated names are returned.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are checked against lookup dictionaries; if found, the corresponding translation is returned; if not, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and primarily consists of dictionary lookups with exception handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is well-structured and does not perform any network operations or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static translation mappings for game-related data, providing methods to translate and untranslate identifiers. Each method performs a dictionary lookup and raises an exception if the input is unknown. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network communication, data leakage, or malicious side effects. The functions are purely data mapping utilities. No obfuscation or malware-like behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility for translating game-related identifiers. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The functions operate solely on internal static dictionaries, raising exceptions for unknown inputs, which is expected behavior for such translation utilities.",
