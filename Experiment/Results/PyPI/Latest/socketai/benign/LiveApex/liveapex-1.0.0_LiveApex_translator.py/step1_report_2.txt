{
  "purpose": "The code provides translation functions for converting internal identifiers to user-friendly names and vice versa for maps, datacenters, and weapons in a gaming context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as 'datacenter', 'weapon', and 'map'. It also accesses internal translation dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "The code raises exceptions if an input value is not found in the translation dictionaries, which could be a control flow or error handling sink.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are checked against translation dictionaries; if found, the function returns the corresponding translation. If not, an exception is raised, terminating the flow.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns; the functions are straightforward dictionary lookups with exception handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network activity is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of static mappings between internal and common names for maps, datacenters, and weapons, with simple functions for translation and reverse translation. No external data sources, network calls, or file operations are involved. Error handling via exceptions is standard and only occurs on unknown input values. The logic is transparent and directly related to data translation without any suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a straightforward translation utility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It operates purely on static data dictionaries with standard error handling. Overall, it is safe and aligns with its intended purpose.",
