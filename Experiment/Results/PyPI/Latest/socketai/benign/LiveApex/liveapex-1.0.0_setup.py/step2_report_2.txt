  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n1. **Assessment of the code:**  \nThe provided code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package named 'LiveApex'. It specifies dependencies, metadata, and packaging details. There are no obvious signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities within this snippet.\n\n2. **Evaluation of the reports:**  \nAll five reports are empty, providing no details about potential issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior. This makes it impossible to identify any errors, flaws, or malicious activity based solely on the reports.\n\n3. **Potential issues or concerns:**  \n- Since the reports are empty, there's no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security flaws.  \n- The dependencies specified ('protobuf==6.30.1' and 'websockets==12.0') are common libraries, and nothing suspicious is immediately apparent.  \n- The package's purpose is to interact with the Apex Legends LiveAPI, which by itself isn't suspicious.\n\n4. **Scores and justification:**  \n- **Malware score:** Given the lack of evidence, the malware score should be very low or zero.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward and not obfuscated; thus, this should also be low or zero.  \n- **Risk score:** Without any reported issues or suspicious activity, the overall risk should be minimal, likely close to zero.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  \nSince no specific issues are reported, and the code appears standard, I recommend the following scores:  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the unknowns and the fact that the reports are empty but the package interacts with game APIs, which could be sensitive depending on context)\n\n**Final notes:**  \n- If future reports provide details, a re-evaluation would be necessary.  \n- The absence of evidence of malicious activity suggests this package is likely safe, but always remain cautious when dealing with packages that interact with game APIs or external services.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is standard and does not show signs of malware or obfuscation.  \n- The empty reports do not provide any grounds for concern.  \n- The scores should be minimal, reflecting the lack of detected issues.\n\nWould you like me to assist further with a different package or more detailed analysis once more information is available?",
