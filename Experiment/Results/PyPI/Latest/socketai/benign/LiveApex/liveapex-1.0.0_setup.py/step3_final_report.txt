  "purpose": "A setup script for the Python package 'LiveApex', defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependencies ('protobuf==6.30.1', 'websockets==12.0'), and package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the script does not process external input or output data beyond package configuration.",
  "flows": "The script flows from defining package info to calling setup(), with dependencies specified for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The provided reports are empty, offering no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. Dependencies are common libraries with no signs of malicious payloads. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest a benign package. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be minimal, reflecting the lack of issues. The overall assessment indicates a safe and standard package with no detected security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The package appears benign, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks based on the code and empty reports. Scores are set to reflect minimal threat.",
