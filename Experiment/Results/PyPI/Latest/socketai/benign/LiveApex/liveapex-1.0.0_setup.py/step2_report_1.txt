  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The provided code appears to be a straightforward setup script for a Python package named \"LiveApex.\" There are no obvious malicious or suspicious elements in this code snippet itself. It primarily defines package metadata and dependencies.\n\n2. **Review of the reports:**  \n   All five reports contain only \"Empty response\" errors with no additional details or raw responses. This suggests that the reports lack substantive information about potential vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or flaws.\n\n3. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   Since the reports are empty, there's no reasoning or claims to evaluate or critique. They do not provide any evidence or analysis to support concerns about the package.\n\n4. **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n   Without any content in the reports, there are no issues to score. Any scores assigned would be arbitrary and not justified by evidence.\n\n5. **Malware and risk scores:**  \n   - **Malware score:** Given the absence of any malicious code or behavior in the provided setup script, the malware score should be very low or zero.  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** There is no obfuscation apparent in the code snippet. The code is straightforward and readable.  \n   - **Risk score:** Without any reported issues or suspicious activity, the risk score should also be minimal.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   Since the reports are empty, there are no claims or assumptions to challenge.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   As no issues are reported, any high scores would be inconsistent. The scores should reflect the lack of evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal risk due to lack of information, but always leave a small buffer for potential unknowns)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The provided setup script does not include any suspicious or malicious code such as network activity, obfuscated strings, or hidden payloads.\n- The empty reports suggest a need for more detailed analysis or that no issues were found or reported.\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the available information, the package appears benign, and the scores should reflect that. No evidence supports higher malware or obfuscation scores, and the overall risk is minimal.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores low unless new, substantive reports emerge.",
