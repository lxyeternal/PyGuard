{
  "purpose": "The code exports three functions related to intercepting print statements, exceptions, and logging, likely for debugging or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from local modules: .console, .exceptions, and .logging",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that handle untrusted data or lead to data leakage or malicious actions",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; just module exports of imported functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing functions from relative modules and defining __all__ for exports. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The modules imported may implement interceptors, but this code only re-exports them, which is common practice for modular design. No malicious intent or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module exporting functions for intercepting console, exception, and logging behaviors. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are present.",
