{
  "purpose": "The code is exporting functions that likely intercept or modify standard output, exceptions, and logging behavior, possibly for debugging, monitoring, or instrumentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .console, .exceptions, .logging",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no use of untrusted data or external systems within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly visible in this snippet; possible flow involves imported functions being called elsewhere to intercept standard behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions from local modules and exposes them via __all__, which is standard for defining public API components in a package. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or obfuscation. The purpose appears to be for intercepting or modifying output, exceptions, and logging, which is common in monitoring or debugging tools. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward public API declaration for intercepting print, exceptions, and logging functionality, with no malicious intent or security risks evident.",
