{
  "purpose": "Module that imports and re-exports functions for intercepting print, exceptions, and logging, likely for debugging or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.console, .exceptions, .logging).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no external data handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Import statements to __all__ export list; no data flow beyond module scope.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports three functions from local modules and re-exports them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. The functions' internal implementations are not shown, but based on naming, they are standard interceptors for print, exceptions, and logging. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No issues or suspicious behaviors are detected or inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module for re-exporting monitoring functions. All reports are accurate, and the security risk and malware scores are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
