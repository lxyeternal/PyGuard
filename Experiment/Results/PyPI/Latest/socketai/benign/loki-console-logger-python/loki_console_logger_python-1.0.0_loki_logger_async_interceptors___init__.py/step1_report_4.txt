{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports functions for intercepting print statements, exceptions, and logging, likely for debugging or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from local modules: console, exceptions, logging",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules, then re-exports these functions via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions related to intercepting print, exceptions, and logging from local modules and re-exports them for external use. There are no apparent data flows involving untrusted input, no external network connections, or suspicious code patterns. The module appears to be a straightforward interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It serves as an interface to other interception functionalities, likely part of a debugging or monitoring tool.",
