{
  "purpose": "Define configuration options for a Loki logger, including URL, tenant ID, application name, authentication token, batching, flushing, and labels.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the __init__ constructor method: url, tenant_id, app_name, auth_token, labels, dynamic_labels.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly shown in this code; potential sinks could include usage of auth_token or URL in logging or network operations elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Constructor parameters are assigned directly to instance variables; no data flow analysis is possible without additional context.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward class definition with parameter assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class constructor defining configuration options with default values. There are no signs of suspicious code, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The auth_token is optional, and labels are set with default empty dictionaries if not provided, which is typical. No external data is read or written in this snippet, and no code injection, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign configuration class for a logging utility. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present based on this fragment.",
