  "purpose": "Configuration holder for Loki logging options, encapsulating connection details, authentication, batching, and labeling.",
  "sources": "Parameters provided during class instantiation: url, tenant_id, app_name, auth_token, labels, dynamic_labels.",
  "sinks": "None within this code snippet; potential external use of parameters could involve network transmission or data handling, but not present here.",
  "flows": "Assignment of input parameters directly to class attributes; no data processing or external data flow occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; use of optional auth_token and dynamic_labels with callables is standard, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data container class with no data processing, network activity, or code execution. Parameters like auth_token and dynamic_labels are optional and handled safely. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The use of callables for labels is flexible but not malicious. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration class with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misconfiguration of sensitive parameters, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
