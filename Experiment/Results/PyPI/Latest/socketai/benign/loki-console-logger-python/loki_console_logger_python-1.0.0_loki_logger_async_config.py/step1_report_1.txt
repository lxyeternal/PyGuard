{
  "purpose": "Define a configuration class for Loki logging options, encapsulating connection details, authentication, batching, and labels.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the __init__ method: url, tenant_id, app_name, auth_token, labels, dynamic_labels",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows into the class via constructor parameters, especially url, tenant_id, app_name, and auth_token",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to class attributes, but no data is processed or transmitted within this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or unusual code structures",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward class for storing configuration options. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. Sensitive fields like auth_token are optional and set via parameters, which is standard. The class does not contain any apparent malicious behavior or malicious intent. It does not perform any operations beyond assigning constructor parameters to attributes.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard configuration class without any malicious code or security issues. It is a typical pattern for setting up logging options and does not exhibit malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
