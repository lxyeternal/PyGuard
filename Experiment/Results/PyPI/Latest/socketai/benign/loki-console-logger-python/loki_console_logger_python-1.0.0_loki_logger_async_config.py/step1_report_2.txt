{
  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for Loki logging options, including parameters for URL, tenant ID, application name, authentication token, batching, flushing, and labels.",
  "sources": "Input data for the class constructor parameters: url, tenant_id, app_name, auth_token, labels, dynamic_labels.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not directly process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Initialization assigns input parameters directly to class attributes; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be straightforward data container with no suspicious logic or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an __init__ method that initializes various configuration attributes for a logging setup. It accepts parameters that could come from untrusted sources (e.g., URL, auth_token), but the code itself does not perform any operations beyond assigning these parameters. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated elements, or suspicious behavior observed. The class serves as a simple data holder, with optional parameters for labels and dynamic labels, which are standard for such configurations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply stores parameters related to Loki logging options without any harmful logic or hidden actions.",
