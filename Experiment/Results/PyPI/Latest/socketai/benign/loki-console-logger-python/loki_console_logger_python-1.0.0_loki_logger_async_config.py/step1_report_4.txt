{
  "purpose": "Define configuration options for a Loki logging client, including URL, tenant ID, application name, authentication token, batching, flushing, and labels.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the __init__ method, especially url, tenant_id, app_name, auth_token, labels, and dynamic_labels.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as url, tenant_id, app_name, auth_token, labels, and dynamic_labels could be used insecurely if accessed improperly or exposed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to class attributes; no external data sources or sinks are evident in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated features, or suspicious behaviors are present. The auth_token is optional but could be misused if misconfigured; however, that alone isn't suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class constructor setting attributes for logging configuration. There are no input/output operations, no external calls, and no use of dangerous functions or dynamic code execution. The auth_token being optional might raise concern if misused, but it is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply stores provided parameters for later use in logging operations.",
