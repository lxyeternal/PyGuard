{
  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for Loki logging options, encapsulating various settings such as URL, tenant ID, app name, authentication token, batch size, flush interval, and labels.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the __init__ method: url, tenant_id, app_name, auth_token, labels, dynamic_labels.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive attributes like auth_token; no direct data sinks are present, but auth_token could be misused if accessed maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the initialization parameters to instance attributes; dynamic_labels may invoke functions to generate label values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or malicious code patterns observed; use of dynamic_labels with callable functions is flexible but not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an initializer setting multiple attributes related to Loki logging options. It allows optional authentication tokens and dynamic labels, which could be used for flexible label generation. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of optional callables for labels is common for dynamic label assignment but should be used cautiously to avoid unintended side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward configuration class without malicious intent. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. It is a standard pattern for setting up logging options.",
