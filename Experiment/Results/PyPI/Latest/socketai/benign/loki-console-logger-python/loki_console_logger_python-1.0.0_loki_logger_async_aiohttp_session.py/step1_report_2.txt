  "purpose": "Send log data to a Loki logging server asynchronously.",
  "sources": "get_labels(options), log_buffer, options.url, options.tenant_id, options.auth_token",
  "sinks": "session.post to options.url with payload and headers",
  "flows": "get_labels(options) -> payload['streams'][0]['stream']; log_buffer -> payload['streams'][0]['values']; headers including options.tenant_id and optionally options.auth_token -> session.post -> response handling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of async HTTP request appears standard; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a payload with labels and log values, sets headers with tenant ID and optional auth token, then makes an asynchronous HTTP POST request to send logs to a Loki server. It handles responses by printing failures but suppresses exceptions. No malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of options for configuration is typical and not suspicious. The error handling is minimal but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard asynchronous logging client to Loki, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It securely uses options provided externally for configuration. No anomalies or malicious signals detected.",
