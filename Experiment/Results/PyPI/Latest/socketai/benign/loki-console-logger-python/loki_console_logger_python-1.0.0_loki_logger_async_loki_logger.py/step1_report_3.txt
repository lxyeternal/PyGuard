{
  "purpose": "This code implements a logging class (LokiLogger) for capturing and flushing logs, including event tracking and integration with interceptors for exception, print, and logging interception.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters (event_name, properties), current timestamp via now_ns(), and potentially from interceptors that may override print, logging, and exception behaviors.",
  "sinks": "Uses log_buffer to store log messages, which are eventually flushed; no direct data leaks or untrusted outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> log_buffer append -> flush_logs called -> buffer copied and cleared -> send_logs with buffer copy.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious logic observed. Use of interceptors might modify behavior but are not inherently malicious. atexit ensures logs are flushed on exit, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages logging functionalities, intercepting print, logging, and exceptions for enhanced logging or debugging. It uses timestamps and safe_json for serializing properties. The atexit ensures logs are flushed when the program terminates. No external data leaks, malicious payloads, or backdoors are apparent. The code adheres to expected patterns for logging utilities without suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility with interceptors to enhance logging. No malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are evident. The overall design is benign and intended for safe log management.",
