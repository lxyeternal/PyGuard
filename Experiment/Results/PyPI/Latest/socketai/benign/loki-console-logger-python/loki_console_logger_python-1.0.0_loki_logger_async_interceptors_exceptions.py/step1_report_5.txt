  "purpose": "To intercept uncaught exceptions, log them with a timestamp, and flush the logs asynchronously.",
  "sources": "sys.excepthook, traceback.format_exception, time_ns, asyncio.get_event_loop",
  "sinks": "logger.log_buffer.append, logger.flush_logs()",
  "flows": "Uncaught exceptions trigger custom_hook -> log exception details -> attempt to flush logs asynchronously",
  "anomalies": "Uses sys.excepthook to globally intercept exceptions, which is a common debugging technique but can be misused for malicious purposes if logger or flush_logs are maliciously implemented elsewhere. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors evident in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code replaces the default sys.excepthook with a custom handler that logs exception details with a timestamp. It then attempts to flush logs asynchronously depending on whether an asyncio event loop is running. The code employs standard modules and functions for exception handling and asynchronous execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious network activity, or malicious code. The logger object and its methods are assumed to be provided and safe. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no malicious intent apparent in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to enhance exception logging by capturing unhandled exceptions and asynchronously flushing logs. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain security threats. It appears to be a legitimate debugging or monitoring utility.",
