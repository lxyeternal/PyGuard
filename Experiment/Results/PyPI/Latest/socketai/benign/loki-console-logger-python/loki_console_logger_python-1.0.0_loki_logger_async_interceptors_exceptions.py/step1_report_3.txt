  "purpose": "Intercepts unhandled exceptions in the Python runtime and logs exception details with timestamps, then attempts to flush logs asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Exception occurrences that trigger sys.excepthook; traceback.format_exception for exception details.",
  "sinks": "logger.log_buffer (appending exception info); asyncio.get_event_loop and asyncio.run for asynchronous log flushing.",
  "flows": "Uncaught exception -> sys.excepthook -> log_buffer append; then attempt to flush logs asynchronously via event loop.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or hidden backdoors. Use of exception handling and asyncio appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the default sys.excepthook to capture uncaught exceptions, appends the exception details with a timestamp to a log buffer, and then tries to flush logs asynchronously using asyncio. The implementation involves standard Python debugging and asynchronous patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior. The code does not leak sensitive data, connect to external domains, or perform harmful actions. It is a typical error handling and logging pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception interception and logging mechanism with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It primarily enhances error tracking within an application. There are no security risks or suspicious behaviors observed.",
