  "purpose": "Override sys.excepthook to log unhandled exceptions with traceback and timestamp, then asynchronously flush logs.",
  "sources": "sys.excepthook, traceback.format_exception, time.time_ns, logger.log_buffer",
  "sinks": "logger.log_buffer (appending exception info), asyncio.create_task, asyncio.run",
  "flows": "Exception occurs -> custom_hook invoked -> traceback formatted -> appended to log_buffer -> flush_logs scheduled via asyncio -> original excepthook called",
  "anomalies": "Use of asyncio.run() inside exception handler, which may interfere with existing event loops; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code intercepts unhandled exceptions, logs traceback info with timestamp, and attempts to flush logs asynchronously. It employs standard modules and patterns, with the unconventional use of asyncio.run() in an exception context. No malicious activity, external connections, or obfuscation are present. Potential operational issues may arise in environments with existing asyncio event loops, but this does not constitute security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign exception logging utility with no evidence of malicious intent. The main concern is the unconventional use of asyncio.run(), which could cause runtime issues but not security threats. Overall, supply chain security risk is low.",
