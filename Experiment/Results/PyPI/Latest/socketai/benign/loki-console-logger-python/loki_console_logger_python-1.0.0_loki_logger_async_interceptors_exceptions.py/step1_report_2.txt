  "purpose": "The code sets up a custom exception hook to intercept uncaught exceptions, log them with a timestamp, and attempt to flush logs asynchronously.",
  "sources": "sys.excepthook (replaced with custom_hook), traceback.format_exception (reads exception details), time_ns (reads current timestamp), logger.log_buffer (reads stored logs)",
  "sinks": "logger.flush_logs (potentially involves I/O or network if implemented to send logs elsewhere), appending to logger.log_buffer",
  "flows": "uncaught exception -> custom_hook -> log buffer append -> attempt to flush logs asynchronously",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated behavior. Use of exception hook to capture and log exceptions is standard. No malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the default sys.excepthook with a custom function that logs exception details with a timestamp. It then tries to flush logs asynchronously, either by creating a task if an event loop is running or by running a new event loop with asyncio.run(). It catches exceptions during this process silently, which is generally good practice to avoid crashing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The purpose appears to be robust exception logging. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard exception handling and logging mechanism without evidence of malicious intent. It could be part of a monitoring system to capture uncaught exceptions for debugging or auditing purposes.",
