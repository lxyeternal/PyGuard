  "purpose": "Define type aliases for dictionaries containing dynamic label generators and fixed string labels.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, output, or data leaks occur.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and does not contain unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing constructs and creates type aliases for dictionaries. 'DynamicLabels' maps strings to callable objects returning any type, potentially used for dynamic label generation. 'FixedLabels' maps strings to fixed string values. There are no inputs, outputs, or runtime behavior; the code is purely type annotation definitions. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as type alias definitions for better code clarity and type checking. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
