{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases for dynamic labels (callables returning any value) and fixed labels (string to string mapping).",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read any input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or process data in a way that could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only declares type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and idiomatic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias declarations using Python's typing module. It introduces two dictionary types: one for labels whose values are callables returning any type, and one for labels with fixed string values. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no untrusted data handling. The structure and syntax are standard and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, non-malicious, and serves only to define type aliases for labeling purposes. It poses no security risk or malicious behavior.",
