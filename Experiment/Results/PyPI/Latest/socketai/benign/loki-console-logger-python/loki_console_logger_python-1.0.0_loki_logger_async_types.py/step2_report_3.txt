  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code to ensure accuracy and consistency.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code.**  \nAll reports describe straightforward type alias definitions with no input/output, data processing, or dynamic behavior. The code snippets are identical in purpose: defining `DynamicLabels` and `FixedLabels` as type aliases.  \n**Conclusion:** There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious elements in the code.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning.**  \n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely for type annotations and does not perform any data handling or contain malicious patterns.  \n- They consistently state that there are no anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The analysis is accurate, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned to each report.**  \n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.  \n- The confidence is 1 for all, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5.**  \n- No report assigns a risk score above 0.0.  \n- Given the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious activity, this is appropriate.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware scores.**  \n- All reports correctly assign `malware: 0`.  \n- No malicious behavior is indicated or implied.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge any assumptions about vulnerabilities.**  \n- All reports correctly state that there are no vulnerabilities, given the code's static and benign nature.\n\n**Step 7: Ensure score consistency.**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 for all reports.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 for all reports, as there's no security concern.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\nGiven the totality of the reports and the code, I concur with the assessments. The code is purely type alias definitions with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign, with no security risks or malware.  \n- The reports are accurate in their reasoning.  \n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0**.",
