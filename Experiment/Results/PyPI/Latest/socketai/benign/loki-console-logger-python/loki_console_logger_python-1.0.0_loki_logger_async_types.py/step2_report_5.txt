  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions using Python's typing module.\n- No input/output, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- The purpose is to improve code clarity and type safety, likely used as a utility module.\n- All reports agree on benign intent and security safety.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is purely type alias definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or flaws?**  \n  None. The code is syntactically correct and semantically straightforward.\n\n- **Any reasoning mistakes?**  \n  No. The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature. No change needed.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0 or 0.5, generally indicating minimal or no risk. Since there's no malicious activity, a score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  None. All reports correctly dismiss potential vulnerabilities, as the code is only type annotations.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  Consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the uniformity and correctness of the reports, I agree with their conclusions. The code is harmless, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's benign nature and lack of security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is a simple, safe set of type alias definitions with no security implications. No adjustments needed.",
