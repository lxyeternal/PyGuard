  "purpose": "Define type aliases for dictionaries with specific key/value types to improve code clarity and type safety.",
  "sources": "Type alias definitions using Dict[str, Callable[[], Any]] and Dict[str, str]",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data",
  "flows": "None; the code only declares type aliases without runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward type alias declarations with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two type alias definitions: 'DynamicLabels' as a dictionary with string keys and callable values returning any type, and 'FixedLabels' as a dictionary with string keys and string values. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or dynamic behaviors. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code is static and serves purely for type hinting. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of type alias definitions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
