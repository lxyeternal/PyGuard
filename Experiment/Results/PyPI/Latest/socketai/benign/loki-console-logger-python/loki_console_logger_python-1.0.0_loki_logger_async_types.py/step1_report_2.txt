  "purpose": "Defines type aliases for label dictionaries, one with callable values and one with fixed string values.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only declares type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type annotations and declares two type aliases for dictionaries: one with string keys and callable values returning any type, and another with string keys and string values. There are no data flows, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be straightforward type alias declarations with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple type alias declaration for organizing label dictionaries. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks.",
