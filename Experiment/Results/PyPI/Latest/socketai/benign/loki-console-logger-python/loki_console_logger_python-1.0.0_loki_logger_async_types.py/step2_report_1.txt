  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the accuracy of their conclusions, the appropriateness of the scores, and identify any potential issues.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward type alias definitions.\n- No data input/output, data flow, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity are indicated.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), which seems justified given the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the descriptions: it only defines two type aliases:\n  - `DynamicLabels = Dict[str, Callable[[], Any]]`\n  - `FixedLabels = Dict[str, str]`\n- No actual data processing, input/output, or runtime behavior exists.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence scores of 1 are justified.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since the code is purely type alias declarations, the risk scores should remain at zero.\n- The malware score should stay at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0, given the code's clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThese align with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The scores are appropriate, and there are no overlooked security concerns or malicious indicators.\n\n**Final note:** The code is harmless, serves only as type annotations, and poses no security threat.",
