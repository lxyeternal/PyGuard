  "purpose": "Define type aliases for label dictionaries with dynamic and fixed values",
  "sources": "No input or data reading in this code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only declares type aliases",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports type annotations and defines two type aliases: 'DynamicLabels' for dictionaries mapping strings to callable functions returning any value, and 'FixedLabels' for dictionaries mapping strings to strings. No data input, output, or execution logic is present. The code appears to serve as a type hinting utility or a module for later use, with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as type alias definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
