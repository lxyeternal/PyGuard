  "purpose": "Utility functions for timestamp generation, safe JSON serialization, and dynamic label extraction.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from time.time(), options.dynamic_labels, options.labels, and options.app_name.",
  "sinks": "The json.dumps() function serializes data; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from options.dynamic_labels and options.labels into get_labels, then is serialized via safe_json.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic_labels with potential for executing callables; exception handling is broad, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: now_ns() generates a nanosecond timestamp as a string; safe_json() attempts to serialize data with json.dumps, returning an empty object string on failure; get_labels() constructs a label dictionary from static options and dynamic_labels, invoking callables to generate label values. There is no evidence of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of callables in dynamic_labels could theoretically be misused if options.dynamic_labels contains malicious functions, but this is context-dependent and not inherently malicious. Exception handling is broad but not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve benign utility purposes without any malicious intent or security risks. There are no signs of malware or malicious data flows. The use of dynamic callables warrants cautious use but is not inherently dangerous.",
