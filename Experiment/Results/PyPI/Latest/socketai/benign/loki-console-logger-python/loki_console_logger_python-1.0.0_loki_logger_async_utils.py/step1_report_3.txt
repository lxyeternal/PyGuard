  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for generating current timestamp in nanoseconds, safe JSON serialization, and retrieving labels from options.",
  "sources": "time module for current timestamp; json module for serialization; options.dynamic_labels, options.app_name, options.labels for data extraction",
  "sinks": "json.dumps for serialization, which outputs data but does not directly execute or leak input data; no other sinks identified",
  "flows": "Data from options.dynamic_labels, options.app_name, and options.labels flows into label dictionary; then through json.dumps",
  "anomalies": "The function get_labels executes functions from options.dynamic_labels, which could potentially be unsafe if the functions are malicious or maliciously designed, but this is standard usage and not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three utility functions: now_ns() generates a timestamp in nanoseconds as a string; safe_json() serializes data to JSON with exception handling; get_labels() attempts to build a labels dictionary from options, executing functions in options.dynamic_labels if present. The functions use standard libraries and do not include any suspicious or malicious behavior. The execution of functions in options.dynamic_labels could be risky if the functions are untrusted, but that depends on external context, not the code itself. Overall, the code appears to be standard utility functions with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides benign utility functions for timestamping, JSON serialization, and label retrieval. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment. The only minor consideration is the execution of dynamic functions which could be risky if untrusted, but this is typical in flexible configurations.",
