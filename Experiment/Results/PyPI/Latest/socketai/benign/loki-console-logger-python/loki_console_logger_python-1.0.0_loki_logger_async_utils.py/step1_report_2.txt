  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating a timestamp, safe JSON serialization, and label collection from options.",
  "sources": "The function get_labels reads from options.dynamic_labels and options.labels; options.app_name is also read.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write or send data outside; no untrusted sink operations are present.",
  "flows": "The dynamic_labels are generated from functions in options.dynamic_labels, then merged with labels from options.labels and app_name.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of try-except blocks around JSON dumping and label extraction is standard. No dynamic code execution or malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for timestamp generation, safe JSON serialization, and label assembly from an options object. It employs try-except blocks for error handling but does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No suspicious behavior or malware indicators are detected. The code appears to be straightforward and intended for standard application support.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic utility functions without any malicious intent or security risks. No malware or malicious activity is evident, and the structure is clear and conventional.",
