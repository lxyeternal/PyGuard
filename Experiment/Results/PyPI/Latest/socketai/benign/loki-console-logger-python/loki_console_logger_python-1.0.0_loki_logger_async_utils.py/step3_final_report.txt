  "purpose": "Utility functions for timestamp generation, safe JSON serialization, and dynamic label collection.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from options.dynamic_labels, options.labels, and options.app_name.",
  "sinks": "Execution of functions within options.dynamic_labels, potential for untrusted code execution.",
  "flows": "get_labels() calls functions in options.dynamic_labels to generate label values, which are then combined with static labels.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of functions stored in options.dynamic_labels could be risky if untrusted, but this is a known pattern and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions with no network activity or data exfiltration. The only potential security concern is executing functions in options.dynamic_labels, which could be malicious if those functions are untrusted. Exception handling is broad but typical for such utility code. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code, with a cautious note on dynamic function execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with a minor security consideration regarding dynamic function execution. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
