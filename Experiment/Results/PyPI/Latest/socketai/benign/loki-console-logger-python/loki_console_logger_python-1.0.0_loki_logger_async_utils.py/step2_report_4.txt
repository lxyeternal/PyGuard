  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code is straightforward utility functions with no malicious behavior. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Broad exception handling could mask issues but is not suspicious.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — slightly elevated but justified given the execution of callables in dynamic_labels; however, if options.dynamic_labels contains malicious functions, it could be risky, but this is context-dependent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent detected. The risk score is modest, reflecting the potential danger if untrusted functions are used.\n- **Overall:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; no malicious code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Use of try-except is standard.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.\n  - Security Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is benign utility functions.\n- **Overall:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to previous; no malicious behavior. The execution of functions in options.dynamic_labels could be risky if untrusted, but this is standard and not inherently malicious.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No major flaws; broad exception handling is typical.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.\n  - Security Risk: 0.1 — slightly higher than previous reports, justified by the dynamic execution aspect.\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score is appropriate; execution of arbitrary functions can be risky if untrusted, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern; no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Broad exception handling, but standard.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent; execution of dynamic functions could be risky but is typical.\n- **Overall:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar utility functions, with the note that executing functions from options.dynamic_labels could be risky if untrusted.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No malicious code, but the potential for misuse exists.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — justified given the dynamic function execution.\n- **Justification:** No malware or obfuscation; the risk is theoretical and context-dependent.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2) depending on the perceived risk of executing dynamic functions. These are reasonable given the context.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — a minimal but noteworthy concern due to execution of potentially untrusted callables, but overall low.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores are consistent with the code's nature. The only point of contention could be the risk score, but given the context, a value around 0.1-0.2 is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns well with the code's benign nature. No significant adjustments needed.",
