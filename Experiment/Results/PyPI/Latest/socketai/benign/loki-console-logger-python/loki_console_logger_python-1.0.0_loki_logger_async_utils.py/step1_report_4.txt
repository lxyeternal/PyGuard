  "purpose": "Utility functions for timestamp generation, JSON serialization, and label aggregation.",
  "sources": "time module for current timestamp, options object for dynamic labels and labels",
  "sinks": "json.dumps for serializing data, potential exception handling for unsafe data",
  "flows": "Data from options object and options.dynamic_labels functions flow into label dictionary and then into JSON serialization",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except blocks with broad exception catching; no suspicious code patterns or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: 'now_ns' generates a timestamp in nanoseconds, 'safe_json' serializes data safely with exception handling, and 'get_labels' constructs a label dictionary, calling functions stored in options.dynamic_labels. The code appears to be straightforward and does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. Exception handling is broad but typical for robustness. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for timestamping, JSON serialization, and label management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
