{
  "purpose": "The code replaces the built-in print function with a custom version that logs printed messages with timestamps.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from any part of the program that calls print(), which is globally overridden.",
  "sinks": "The logged messages are appended to logger.log_buffer and may be processed or stored later; no direct leak or external transmission is evident.",
  "flows": "Calls to print() → custom_print() function → appends timestamped message to logger.log_buffer → calls logger.flush_manager.check_and_flush()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated code present. The code dynamically replaces a core function but does not do anything malicious or unexpected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports builtins and time, defines a function to intercept print statements, and replaces the global print with a custom function that logs messages with timestamps. It uses the logger object to store logs and triggers a flush check. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are evident. The code serves as a logging utility, possibly for debugging or audit purposes. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility to intercept and log print statements with timestamps. It does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks but could be used in a monitoring context. No malicious behavior detected.",
