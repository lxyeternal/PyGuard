{
  "purpose": "Override the built-in print function to log printed messages with timestamps and trigger buffer flushing.",
  "sources": "Reading input from the built-in print function call arguments.",
  "sinks": "Appended log buffer which stores timestamped messages; potential for log leakage if buffer is insecurely stored or transmitted.",
  "flows": "print() → custom_print() → logger.log_buffer.append() and logger.flush_manager.check_and_flush()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior; usage of standard library functions is typical. No obfuscation or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the global print function to capture all printed output. It logs each message with a timestamp and calls methods to manage log flushing. The implementation appears straightforward and intended for logging or debugging purposes without any malicious side effects. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation is present. The code does not perform any insecure operations beyond logging, which is common practice.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a logging wrapper around the print function for debugging or auditing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard pattern for capturing output, with no suspicious or malicious intent.",
