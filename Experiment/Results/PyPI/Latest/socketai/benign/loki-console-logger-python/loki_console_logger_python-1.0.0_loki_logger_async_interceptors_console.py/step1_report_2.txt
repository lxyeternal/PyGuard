{
  "purpose": "Intercepts and logs calls to the built-in print function by redirecting print to a custom logger that records messages with timestamps.",
  "sources": "The built-in print function is overridden, so the source of input is any call to print within the code that uses this module.",
  "sinks": "The logger's buffer appends timestamped messages; no external data sinks are directly involved in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "When print is called, the custom_print function captures the message, timestamps it, stores it in the logger's buffer, checks for flushing, and then calls the original print.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution observed. The code modifies global behavior of print, which is a common pattern for logging or debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code replaces the built-in print function with a custom function that logs each print call with a timestamp to a buffer. It then calls the original print to display the message. This pattern is typical for logging or debugging purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The only potential concern is the global override of print, which might be used maliciously in a different context, but in this isolated snippet, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign logging utility designed to intercept print statements and log them with timestamps. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior based on this fragment.",
