{
  "purpose": "Override the built-in print function to log printed messages with timestamps and manage buffer flushing.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it intercepts calls to print by replacing the built-in print function.",
  "sinks": "The logger's log_buffer is appended with timestamped messages; no data leaks or external outputs are directly involved.",
  "flows": "Intercepted print calls are redirected to custom_print, which appends data to logger.log_buffer and calls flush_manager.check_and_flush(), then proceeds to original print.",
  "anomalies": "Code replaces the global print function without restriction, which could be used to hide malicious logging or interfere with standard output behavior; however, no malicious intent evident from this snippet alone.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the global print function to capture all print output, timestamp it, and store it in a buffer managed by a logger object. It calls a flush check after each print, potentially to control log size or timing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful actions. The code's purpose appears benign: enhanced logging of print statements. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present. The interception method is straightforward and common in logging or debugging scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code replaces the print function for logging purposes, which is a standard technique. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware. However, the global override could be misused in some contexts, but based on this snippet alone, it appears benign.",
