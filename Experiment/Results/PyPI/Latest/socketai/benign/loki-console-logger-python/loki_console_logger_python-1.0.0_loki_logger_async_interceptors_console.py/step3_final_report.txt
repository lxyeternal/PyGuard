  "flows": "print → custom_print → logger.log_buffer.append → logger.flush_manager.check_and_flush → original_print",
  "anomalies": "Global override of builtins.print; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the print function to log messages with timestamps into a buffer and then calls a flush check, finally invoking the original print. No external inputs, no malicious code, no obfuscation. The global override could be misused but is common in logging contexts. No signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging utility that intercepts print calls, logs messages with timestamps, and calls the original print. No malware or obfuscation detected. The slight security concern is the global override, which is typical in debugging but could be misused; however, in this context, it is not malicious.",
