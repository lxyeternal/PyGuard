  "purpose": "The code imports and exposes a LokiLogger class for logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .loki_logger import LokiLogger",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only imports and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a class from a relative module and defining __all__ for export. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The code is typical for a module exposing a class for logging, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign module setup for exposing the LokiLogger class with no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
