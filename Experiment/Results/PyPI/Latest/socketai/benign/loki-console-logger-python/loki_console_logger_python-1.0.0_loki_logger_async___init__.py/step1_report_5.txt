  "purpose": "Exports the LokiLogger class for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement for loki_logger module, which may contain data reading logic.",
  "sinks": "None directly visible; no data sinks or untrusted data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only module import and export definition.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a local module and defines an __all__ list for exports. It does not process input data, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious logic. The presence of a relative import suggests it is part of a larger package. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module export statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe.",
