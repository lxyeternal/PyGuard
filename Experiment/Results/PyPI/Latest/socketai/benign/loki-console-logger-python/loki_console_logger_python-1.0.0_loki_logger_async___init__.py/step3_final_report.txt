  "purpose": "This code module imports the LokiLogger class from a local module and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .loki_logger module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or network activity present",
  "flows": "Import of LokiLogger to external modules via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal re-export module with a straightforward import statement. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain any obfuscated or malicious code. All signals indicate benign behavior. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The code's purpose is solely to expose the LokiLogger class for external use, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks. All scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
