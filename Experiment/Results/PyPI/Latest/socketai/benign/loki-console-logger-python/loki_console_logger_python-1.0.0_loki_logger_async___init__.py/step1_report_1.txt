  "purpose": "Define and expose the LokiLogger class for external use",
  "sources": "Import statement importing LokiLogger from a relative module",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted input or output data",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only sets up export for LokiLogger",
  "anomalies": "Absence of credentials, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior; minimal code with straightforward import/export",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named LokiLogger from a local module and exposes it via __all__ for module export. There are no input sources, no data processing, no network connections, or other potentially malicious behavior. The code is minimal and appears to serve as an interface or re-export of a logger class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that re-exports the LokiLogger class, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
