  "purpose": "Export the LokiLogger class from the current module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .loki_logger import LokiLogger",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no data flows or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class named LokiLogger from a local module and exports it via __all__ for public API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving as an interface or API exposure.\n\nNo suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, hidden network calls, or credential handling are present. It is a typical pattern for module exports in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard module export statement.",
