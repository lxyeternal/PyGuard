  "purpose": "Determine the script's environment setup and import dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__, os.path functions, sys.path modification, import from 'meta'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Source (__file__, os.path functions) to sys.path modification, then to import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup code, no obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code calculates its directory, appends the parent directory to sys.path, and imports a module. No malicious activity, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or sabotage. The slight modification of sys.path is common in setup scripts and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment setup snippet with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are accurate; minor securityRisk of 0.1 in some reports is justified but could be conservatively lowered to 0. Overall, the code is safe and benign.",
