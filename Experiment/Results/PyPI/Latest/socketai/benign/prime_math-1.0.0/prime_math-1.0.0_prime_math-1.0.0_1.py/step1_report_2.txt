{
  "purpose": "The code sets up environment paths and imports a module called 'meta'.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath(__file__), os.path.dirname(__file__), sys.path.append()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data output or external connections.",
  "flows": "Reads the current script file path, modifies sys.path, then imports 'meta'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior or suspicious constructs observed. The import of 'meta' is standard if the module exists locally.",
  "analysis": "The code computes the directory of the current script, appends its parent directory to sys.path, and then imports a module named 'meta'. This is typical for adjusting module search paths during runtime. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. It appears to be a standard environment setup snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, intended to modify the module search path and import a module. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
