  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script with custom install class utilizing a dynamically imported 'meta' module and a custom metaclass.",
  "sources": "Import of 'meta' from parent directory, reading 'README.md', and class definition using 'Metaclass'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; potential for malicious behavior exists if 'meta' or 'Metaclass' are malicious, but none are evident here.",
  "flows": "Import 'meta' -> class creation with 'Metaclass' -> setup execution.",
  "anomalies": "Importing 'meta' from parent directory via sys.path modification; use of a custom metaclass; no obfuscation or code injection detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with a custom install class that uses a metaclass imported from an external 'meta' module. No malicious commands, network activity, or data leaks are present. The main concern is the trustworthiness of 'meta', which could execute code upon import or class creation if malicious. The code itself is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the evidence. The confidence levels are justified based on the limited code and the external dependency. Overall, the supply chain risk appears minimal, but verification of 'meta' is recommended.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard, with potential concern solely about the external 'meta' module. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is found. The current scores are appropriate; the malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and risk at 0.2, pending verification of 'meta'.",
