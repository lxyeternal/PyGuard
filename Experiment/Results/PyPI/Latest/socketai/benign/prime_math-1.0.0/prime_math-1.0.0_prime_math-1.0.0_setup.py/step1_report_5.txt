{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'prime-math', including custom installation behavior via a subclass of setuptools' install command.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md'; imports 'meta.Metaclass'; accesses the 'resources' package data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data is being executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reads README file -> imports 'meta.Metaclass' -> defines custom install class -> executes setup with package data.",
  "anomalies": "Importing 'meta.Metaclass' without further context; potential to execute code upon import if 'meta' contains malicious code. The class 'MeInstall' inherits from 'ina' with a metaclass, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures: reading a README, importing a custom metaclass, defining a custom install class, and executing setup with package data. The only potentially suspicious element is the import of 'meta.Metaclass', which could execute code if 'meta' is malicious or maliciously crafted. However, this is typical for complex setup scripts that customize installation. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution are present. The code is straightforward and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a custom install class, importing an external 'meta' module. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The overall risk is low, assuming 'meta' is trustworthy.",
