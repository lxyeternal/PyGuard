{
  "purpose": "Set up script for packaging and installation of the 'prime-math' Python package, extending the default setuptools installation process with a custom command class.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; importing 'Metaclass' from 'meta' module; executing 'setup' with package data and custom command class.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or eval-like functions are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads a static README file, imports a class, and runs the setup process; no external data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The custom class 'MeInstall' uses a metaclass 'Metaclass', which could potentially introduce unusual behavior, but there is no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. The 'author' field is set to 'None', which is unusual but not malicious. The package data and packages are straightforward. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious code are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard setup procedures with minor customizations. It imports a 'Metaclass' which may alter class creation, but without further details, it does not suggest malicious intent. The code reads a README file for long description and sets up package metadata. There are no obvious security issues, external data sources, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with a custom metaclass. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident. The presence of a potentially unconventional metaclass warrants a minor review, but overall, the code is safe.",
