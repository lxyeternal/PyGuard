{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup process for the 'prime-math' Python package, including a custom install command.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; importing 'meta' module; reading sys.argv and environment; importing setuptools modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks found; no data or commands executed that process untrusted input or lead to data leakage.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup process appears straightforward and static.",
  "anomalies": "Importing a custom 'Metaclass' from 'meta' without revealing what it does; appending parent directory to sys.path may be suspicious if 'meta' is malicious. The class 'MeInstall' inherits from 'ina' with a metaclass 'Metaclass', which could alter behavior, but the code does not show direct malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a setup configuration using setuptools. It reads a README file, sets up package metadata, and defines a custom install command class 'MeInstall' with a metaclass 'Metaclass' imported from 'meta'. The manipulation of sys.path and dynamic import of 'meta' could be used to introduce malicious behavior if 'meta' is malicious, but based solely on this code, no malicious actions are evident. The code does not execute external commands, handle untrusted input, or perform any network activity. The inheritance from 'ina' and the use of a custom metaclass could be used for obfuscation or malicious overrides if 'meta' is malicious, but this cannot be determined here.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with some unusual import practices. No explicit malicious behavior is detected. However, the dynamic import of 'meta' and manipulation of sys.path could potentially be used for malicious purposes if the 'meta' module is malicious. Overall, the script itself is not inherently malicious but warrants review of the 'meta' module.",
