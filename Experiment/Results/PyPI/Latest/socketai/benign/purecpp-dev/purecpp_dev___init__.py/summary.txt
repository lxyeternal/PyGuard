  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate dependency setup for a Python project involving native C++ libraries. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The primary security concern is reliance on external URLs and subprocess commands without checksum validation, which is common in such scripts but should be addressed in production for enhanced security. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical risks associated with external dependencies and environment modifications."
