  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, primarily serving as a placeholder to mitigate dependency confusion risks.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, static package metadata, and uses find_packages() for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted input or perform any data transmission.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.md' to populate long_description; static metadata flows within the setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static code with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling. All reports concur that it is a standard package configuration with no malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, standard package setup with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and assessments are justified and require no modification.",
