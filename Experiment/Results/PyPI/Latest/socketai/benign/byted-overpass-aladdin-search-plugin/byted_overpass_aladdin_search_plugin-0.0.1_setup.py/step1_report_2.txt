  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package, primarily used for packaging and distribution purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'README.md' file for the long_description field.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing occurs within this script.",
  "flows": "Reads the content of 'README.md' and uses it in the package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file for description, defines package metadata, and specifies compatible Python versions. No external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious functions or backdoors are present. The use of 'find_packages()' is typical for package discovery. Overall, the script appears safe and typical for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign and standard setup script for Python packaging. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are detected.",
