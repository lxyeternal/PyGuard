{
  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package setup using setuptools, primarily as a placeholder to mitigate dependency confusion risks.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; uses hardcoded package metadata such as name, version, author info.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The package metadata is static; no data flows from input sources to sinks, and no external untrusted data flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "The only potential anomaly is reading 'README.md' dynamically; however, this is standard practice in setup scripts and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, reads a markdown file for the long description, and sets classifiers and requirements. There are no indications of malicious code, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The script does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard and benign, intended solely for packaging purposes. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
