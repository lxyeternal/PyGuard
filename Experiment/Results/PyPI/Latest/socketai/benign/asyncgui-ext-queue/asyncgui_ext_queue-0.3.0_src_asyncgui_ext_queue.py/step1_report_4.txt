{
  "purpose": "Implementation of an asynchronous queue with multiple ordering options and state management, suitable for concurrent programming.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters (e.g., 'item' in put methods, internal deque/heap structures, 'capacity' parameter, and queue state variables).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to queue containers, and potentially triggers event firing through 'ExclusiveEvent' instances, affecting waiting coroutines.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input into queue methods ('put', 'put_nowait') into internal containers; 'get' retrieves from containers; transfer_items manages moving data between waiters and queue.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious API misuse. Use of 'ExclusiveEvent' for async signaling is standard. No backdoors or secret data embedded. No external network activity or file manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a customizable async queue supporting FIFO, LIFO, and small-first ordering, with appropriate state management (OPENED, HALF_CLOSED, CLOSED). It employs standard Python data structures and concurrency primitives without suspicious code patterns. Exception handling aligns with typical queue semantics. No signs of data exfiltration, external communication, or backdoors. Usage of 'ExclusiveEvent' appears consistent with async signaling, not malicious. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured asynchronous queue implementation without malicious intent. It manages concurrency and queue states appropriately, with no evidence of sabotage or malware. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behaviors or hidden functionalities.",
