  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**: All reports correctly identify that the code is simply defining `__all__` with two string elements, \"body\" and \"json_util\". There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing.\n\n2. **Presence of Anomalies or Suspicious Patterns**: None of the reports find any anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The code is minimal and straightforward.\n\n3. **Malware & Security Risks**: All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which is consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - The **confidence** score is 1 across all reports, which is appropriate given the clarity and simplicity.\n   - The **obfuscated** score is 0, matching the absence of obfuscation.\n   - The **malware** score is 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n   - The **securityRisk** score is 0, since no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n**Critical Review & Recommendations**:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this code is benign and serves a standard purpose in Python modules.\n- No adjustments are necessary for the scores; they reflect the actual content and risk profile accurately.\n- Since the code is just a declaration of exported symbols, there are no assumptions or claims that need challenging.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at **0**.\n- The overall risk score should stay at **0**, given no security concerns.\n\n**Summary**:\n\n| Score Type        | Final Value | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0            | No malicious activity or behavior present.                 |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            | Code is clear, minimal, and straightforward.                |\n| Security Risk     | 0            | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.          |\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code snippet is benign and poses no security threat.",
