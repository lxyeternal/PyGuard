  "purpose": "This code appears to be defining a list of exported identifiers, likely for a module that includes 'body' and 'json_util'.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or leaked are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable; the code only sets a list of exported names.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hidden behaviors, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines an '__all__' list with two string elements. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or dynamic behavior. The list indicates the module exports 'body' and 'json_util'. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a standard purpose of defining module exports. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
