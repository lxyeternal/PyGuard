{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a list of public symbols for a module, likely for import control or namespace management.",
  "sources": "There are no input sources or data reads in this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data output points, especially no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the code only declares a list of strings.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, containing only a list of strings; no anomalies or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets the __all__ variable to include 'body' and 'json_util'. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. There are no embedded secrets, no external input handling, and no apparent malicious constructs. Given its simplicity, it appears to be standard module initialization code, possibly for a package related to JSON utilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign declaration of module exports with no suspicious elements.",
