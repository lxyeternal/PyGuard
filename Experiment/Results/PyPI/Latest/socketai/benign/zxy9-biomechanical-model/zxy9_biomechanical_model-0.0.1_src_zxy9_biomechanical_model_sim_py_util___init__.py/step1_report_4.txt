  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable in this minimal snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal and standard; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are evident.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple module-level export list, typical in Python packages to specify which components are publicly accessible. There are no signs of malicious code, external data handling, or suspicious behavior. The absence of any executable statements or data handling indicates a benign and straightforward purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as an export list for module components. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
