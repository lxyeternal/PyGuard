{
  "purpose": "Declare the exported symbols for the module, specifically 'body' and 'json_util'.",
  "sources": "No data input, external interactions, or dynamic data; static declaration of __all__.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only assigns a list to __all__ without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward and minimal code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines __all__ with two string elements, serving as a module export declaration. It contains no data input, output, processing, or dynamic behavior. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The simplicity and clarity of the code indicate benign intent. All reports correctly assess this, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, with full confidence. The scores are consistent with the code's nature, and no further analysis or action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and should be maintained.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
