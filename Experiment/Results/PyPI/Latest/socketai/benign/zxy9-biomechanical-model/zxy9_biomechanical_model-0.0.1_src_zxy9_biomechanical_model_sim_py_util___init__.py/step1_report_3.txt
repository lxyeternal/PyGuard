  "purpose": "Defines the public API for a module, exposing 'body' and 'json_util' for external use.",
  "sources": "No data reading or input sources are present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets the __all__ list to specify exported symbols 'body' and 'json_util'. It does not contain any executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The snippet is typical for defining module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module API declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
