{
  "purpose": "The code implements a biomechanical simulation of human motion, primarily for educational or research purposes, involving physics calculations and visualization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from specified files ('body_filename', 'start_position_filename') using functions from the 'body' module and loads body parameters and initial positions.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with system functions such as 'time.time()' and 'time.sleep()' but does not perform network communication or system modifications. It renders visual output via tkinter but does not send data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input files into the body parameter loader, then into the simulation object. The simulation state updates involve internal computations and visual rendering but do not transmit or receive external untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code employs standard physics computations and visualization libraries without unusual or obfuscated features. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or system harm.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a complex physics simulation using external data files, performs iterative updates of simulation state, and optionally displays a graphical representation of the model. It relies on third-party libraries for numerical and GUI functions but does not contain any network, system modifications, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present. The code appears to be a legitimate scientific or educational implementation with standard patterns and no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This Python code implements a biomechanical simulation with visualization, utilizing external data files and standard libraries. It shows no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It is a well-structured, typical application code for physics simulation and visualization, with no security concerns.",
