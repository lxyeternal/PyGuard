{
  "purpose": "The code implements a biomechanical simulation of human motion, loading parameters from files, interfacing with external C code, and visualizing via Tkinter. It is designed for research or educational purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads body parameters from files, loads start positions, and receives external callback functions for activations and miscellaneous updates.",
  "sinks": "No network operations, file writing, or system modifications are present. Callback functions are user-defined and external.",
  "flows": "Data flows from files into numpy arrays, influencing the simulation state; callback functions influence simulation steps; visualization updates read simulation state for display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code is a transparent, physics-based simulation with standard library usage and external data loading. It interfaces with external C modules for performance. Callback functions are external and user-controlled, which is typical in such frameworks. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is evident. The code structure is clear, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate biomechanical simulation program with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The reliance on external callback functions is a standard extensibility feature and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified.",
