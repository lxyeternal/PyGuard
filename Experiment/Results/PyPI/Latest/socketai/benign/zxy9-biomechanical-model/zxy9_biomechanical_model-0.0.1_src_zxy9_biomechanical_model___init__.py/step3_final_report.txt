  "purpose": "Define the public API symbols for the module",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; static list assignment",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions; static assignment only",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or untrusted data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple list assignment with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a list of strings to __all__, which is a standard Python practice for defining module exports. There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or external interactions. The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's nature. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign, standard Python module export declaration with no security concerns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
