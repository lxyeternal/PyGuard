  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\nFirst, all reports describe the code as a simple list assignment to __all__, which is a common Python pattern for defining public API symbols. The code snippet is minimal, with no data processing, no input/output operations, and no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n**Confirming if issues are present:**  \nAll reports agree that the code contains only a straightforward list assignment. There are no signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The code is benign and standard.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \nNo significant errors are apparent. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that this snippet is a simple module export declaration.\n\n**Scores review:**  \n- Malware: all reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n- Obfuscated: all assign 0, which is correct.  \n- Security risk: all assign 0, consistent with the minimal, harmless nature of the code.\n\n**Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \nThere is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**  \nSince the code does not perform any malicious actions, the malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**  \nNo claims in the reports are based on unfounded assumptions; all are accurate.\n\n**Score consistency:**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign module export declaration with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as harmless. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
