  "purpose": "Setup script for building a C extension module for a Python package, specifically for the 'zxy9_biomechanical_model.sim_c_util' extension.",
  "sources": "The code reads the source file 'src/zxy9_biomechanical_model/sim_c_util.c' and the include directory from numpy's get_include() function.",
  "sinks": "The setup process compiles the C source code; no runtime untrusted data processing occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the process involves static source compilation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of standard setup and extension modules is typical.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python setuptools to define a C extension module. It imports get_include() from numpy to include necessary headers. The code only specifies source files and include directories for compilation. No runtime data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for compiling a C extension module in Python. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical build configuration.",
