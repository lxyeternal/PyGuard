{
  "purpose": "The code is used to set up and compile a Python extension module written in C, specifically 'zxy9_biomechanical_model.sim_c_util'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'src/zxy9_biomechanical_model/sim_c_util.c' source file during setup.",
  "sinks": "No typical untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present in this code; it mainly compiles C code.",
  "flows": "The setup process reads source files and include directories, then compiles the extension module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; usage of 'get_include()' from numpy is standard for including headers.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and numpy, then configures a build process for a C extension. The 'sources' points to a specific C source file, and 'include_dirs' uses numpy's include directory. The code structure and functions are standard for building C extensions in Python, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for compiling a C extension module in Python. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this script.",
