  "purpose": "Setup script for building a Python C extension module named 'zxy9_biomechanical_model.sim_c_util' using setuptools and numpy.",
  "sources": "Import of 'get_include()' from numpy, reference to 'src/zxy9_biomechanical_model/sim_c_util.c' source file.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "The setup process reads the source file and include directories, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for compiling a C extension in Python. It imports standard modules, specifies source files, and include directories. No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted data sources are involved. The referenced C source file is not provided, but the setup script itself is benign. All reports agree on its safety, assigning malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0. The risk scores are also 0, reflecting the absence of security concerns. No logical flaws or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard build script for a Python C extension module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be maintained at 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
