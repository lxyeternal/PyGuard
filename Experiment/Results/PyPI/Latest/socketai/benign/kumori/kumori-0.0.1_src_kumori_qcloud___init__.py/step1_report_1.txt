  "purpose": "The code imports specific components from the 'kumori.qcloud.core' module, likely to utilize user-related functionalities and console outputs.",
  "sources": "The source is the imported module 'kumori.qcloud.core'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this snippet; however, usage of imported components could lead to console output or user data handling.",
  "flows": "The flow would involve using 'User' or 'console' after import, which could involve untrusted input or sensitive data, but none are explicitly used here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors are evident. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'User' and 'console' from a package. Without further context or usage, there's no evidence of malicious behavior. The imported components could be used for legitimate purposes such as user management or logging. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious functions. The code is very simple and straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risk. It appears to be a standard import statement for future use. No malicious behavior or security issues are detectable from this fragment.",
