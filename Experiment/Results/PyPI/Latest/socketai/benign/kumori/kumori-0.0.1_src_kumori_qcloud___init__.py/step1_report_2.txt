{
  "purpose": "Import modules 'User' and 'console' from the 'kumori.qcloud.core' package, likely for user management and console operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading external module 'kumori.qcloud.core'. No user input or external data read is visible.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are shown; no untrusted data handling or external communications are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the only notable aspect is the import of potentially obscure third-party or internal modules, but no malicious or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'User' and 'console' from a module. There are no functions, data handling, or behaviors to evaluate for malicious activity. The imported modules may be used later in the program, but in this snippet, there's nothing suspicious or malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The code simply imports modules, which is standard practice. No malware, anomalies, or security risks are detected at this stage.",
