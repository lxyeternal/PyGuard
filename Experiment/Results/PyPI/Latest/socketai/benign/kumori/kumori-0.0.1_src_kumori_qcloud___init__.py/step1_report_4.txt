  "purpose": "Import classes or functions named User and console from the kumori.qcloud.core module, likely for user management and console output.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from an external module 'kumori.qcloud.core'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling observed; the code is limited to imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected in this minimal code snippet. The import statement itself is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement, which is a common practice in Python for modular code organization. There are no further operations, user inputs, data processing, or output statements present. Without additional context or code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The imported modules could be benign or malicious, but from this snippet alone, no malicious activity can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The snippet is simply importing components from an external module, with no evidence of harmful actions.",
