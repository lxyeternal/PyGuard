  "purpose": "Minimal import statement from 'kumori.qcloud.core' module, likely for utilizing 'User' and 'console' functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading 'User' and 'console' from 'kumori.qcloud.core' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no data processing or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Import source leads to usage of 'User' and 'console' in broader code (not provided), but no flow evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no data handling, code execution, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. Given the minimal context, the code appears benign. The imported module's trustworthiness cannot be determined from this snippet alone, but the import itself is standard practice. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores should reflect this, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score (~0.0 to 0.1). The confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
