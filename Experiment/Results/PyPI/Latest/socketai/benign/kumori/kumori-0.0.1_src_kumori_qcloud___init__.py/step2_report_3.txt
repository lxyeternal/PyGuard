  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, focusing on the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is only an import statement with no further logic or data handling.\n   - There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns in this minimal code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and cautious, correctly noting the lack of suspicious activity based solely on this snippet.\n   - They appropriately mention the lack of context and that the imported modules could be benign or malicious, but no evidence supports malicious intent here.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is reasonable given the evidence.\n   - Security risk scores are low (~0.1), which is appropriate for such minimal import statements.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - The highest confidence is 0.8, but still with low malware and security risk scores, reflecting uncertainty but no evidence of threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n   - The reports do not claim any malicious behavior, only that the code is minimal and benign.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports are cautious and avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they only state that no malicious activity is evident from this snippet.\n   - This is appropriate given the limited code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the analysis.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- Based on this snippet, the code appears benign.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- The key point is that without further context or code execution, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, just because of external module import, which is common in modular code)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code snippet is a standard import statement with no malicious or security issues detectable at this stage. The scores reflect this assessment accurately.",
