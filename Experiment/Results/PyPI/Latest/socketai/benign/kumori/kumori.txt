      "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard Tencent Cloud API client SDK with no signs of malicious activity or backdoors. The only notable issue is the fixed nonce, which could be a security weakness but not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the minor security concern. The overall assessment indicates a safe, legitimate implementation with a small security practice consideration."

The minor issues identified do not elevate the security risk significantly. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to potential misuse if inputs are maliciously crafted, but this is outside the code's scope."
