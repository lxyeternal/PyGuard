  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior. Uses standard cryptographic signing, external modules (`sig_v1`) are trusted, and network communication is secure (SSL default). The code appears to be a legitimate client SDK.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable. Confidence=0.9 is justified given the thoroughness.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing proper handling of credentials, signing, and network requests. No malicious behavior detected. External `sig_v1` module is a dependency, but no evidence it is malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Findings:** Highlights the use of fixed nonce value `114514`. While unconventional, this alone doesn't imply malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The code's flow remains standard for SDKs.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are suitable. The fixed nonce is a minor security concern but not malicious.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, standard API client behavior. No backdoors or malicious code. The fixed nonce value is noted again but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are consistent.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with emphasis on request signing and no suspicious activity. The fixed nonce value is again noted as a minor concern but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, well-structured SDK for Tencent Cloud API interaction.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code, no backdoors.\n- The only repeated minor concern is the use of a fixed nonce (`114514`) in `prepare_params`. While unconventional and potentially reducing signature freshness, it does not constitute malicious activity.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the repeated use of a fixed nonce, which could be a security concern (e.g., replay attacks), but not a malicious one, I would adjust the risk score slightly higher than 0.2, perhaps to **0.3** to reflect this minor issue.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code does not perform any data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity.\n- The external signing module (`sig_v1`) is assumed to be legitimate, but if it were malicious, that could change the risk profile. However, based on the provided code, we cannot evaluate its trustworthiness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at **0**.\n- Slightly increase the security risk score to **0.3** due to the fixed nonce, which could impact signature uniqueness and security if not managed properly.\n- The overall code appears legitimate and safe.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.3\n\nThis reflects a standard SDK with a minor security concern related to nonce reuse, but no malicious intent or activity.",
