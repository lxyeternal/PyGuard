  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard Tencent Cloud API client SDK with no signs of malicious activity or backdoors. The only notable issue is the fixed nonce, which could be a security weakness but not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the minor security concern. The overall assessment indicates a safe, legitimate implementation with a small security practice consideration."
