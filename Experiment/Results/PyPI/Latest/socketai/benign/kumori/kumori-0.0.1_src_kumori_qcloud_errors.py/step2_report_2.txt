  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation:**  \n   The original code defines a class `ApiError` inheriting from `Exception`, with an `__init__` method accepting `message` and optional `errors`. It calls the superclass constructor with `message` and stores `errors` in an attribute.  \n   - **Presence in code:** Yes, the code matches the description.  \n   - **Any issues?** No, the code is straightforward and matches the reports.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Analysis:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is a simple, standard custom exception class with no external data sources, no network or I/O operations, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior.  \n   - **Errors or flaws in reasoning?** No. The assessments are consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**  \n   - The code is a minimal class definition; there are no hidden behaviors or assumptions that suggest vulnerabilities.  \n   - The reports correctly identify that this is a benign pattern.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency:**  \n   The reports are consistent with each other and with the code. They correctly identify that the code is standard, non-malicious, and safe.\n\n6. **My own assessment:**  \n   - **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n   - **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is a typical custom exception class with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- No changes needed to the scores.  \n- The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and non-malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code review confirms that this is a benign, standard pattern for custom exception handling in Python, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
