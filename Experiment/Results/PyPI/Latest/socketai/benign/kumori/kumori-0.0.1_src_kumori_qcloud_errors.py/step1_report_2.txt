  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for API error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data is being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since no data input or output is present.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with an __init__ method that calls the superclass constructor with a message and optionally stores an errors attribute. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no suspicious code behaviors, and no complex or obfuscated code structures. The class appears to be a standard pattern for error handling in Python applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves its purpose of representing API errors without introducing any security concerns.",
