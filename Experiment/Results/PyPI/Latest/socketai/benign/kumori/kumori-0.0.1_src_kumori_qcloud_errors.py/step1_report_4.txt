{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for API errors.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'message' and 'errors' passed during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Super class initialization with 'message' (could be displayed or logged), 'errors' stored in the instance.",
  "flows": "Input 'message' flows into Exception superclass; 'errors' stored as an attribute for later use or retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no external data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It initializes with a message and optional errors. The class only stores data and passes the message to the base class. There are no external data sources, no unsafe or malicious operations, no code injection, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be a straightforward error handling class, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic custom exception class with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves to handle API-related errors cleanly, with no security concerns identified.",
