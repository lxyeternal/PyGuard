  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the underlying code:\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe provided code defines a class `ApiError` that inherits from Python's built-in `Exception`. Its constructor accepts a `message` and an optional `errors` parameter, passing the message to the superclass and storing `errors` as an attribute. The code is minimal, straightforward, and appears to serve as a custom exception for API error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code matches the description: a simple custom exception class with no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The implementation is correct for its purpose.\n\n- **Are the scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign 0 to malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** All reports correctly identify the code as a straightforward custom exception class. They note the absence of external data sources, malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** All conclude that the code is benign with high confidence (1).  \n- **Scores:** All assign malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores of 0, which is consistent.\n\n**Potential Flaws in the Reports:**  \n- The reports are thorough and consistent; they do not overlook any malicious indicators.  \n- They correctly interpret the code as standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** No changes needed; all scores are appropriate.  \n- **Risk assessment:** Since the code is purely a class definition with no external effects or malicious intent, the overall risk remains very low.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, as it's a utility class, but slightly above zero to account for any future misuse, which is minimal)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign custom exception class with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk factors. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo further action or concern is necessary. The code is safe and typical for its purpose.",
