  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code to ensure accuracy and consistency.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code defines a class `ApiError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n- The `__init__` method accepts a message and optional errors, passing the message to the superclass and storing errors.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows common Python patterns for custom exceptions.\n- There are no external data sources, network operations, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, all reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, benign custom exception class.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No, the reports accurately describe the code as standard and free of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue?**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n  These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are zero, which is justified.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious activity. The malware score of 0 in all reports is correct.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports avoid assumptions and correctly state that the code is benign.\n\n- **Score consistency?**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The code is a straightforward exception class with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- No modifications to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk associated with a simple exception class)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign custom exception class. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe, and the reports are accurate.",
