  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for API errors with optional error details.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: message and errors passed during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no external data or system effects are triggered.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored in the object; no data flow to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward and does not perform any unusual or suspicious operations; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The class is a simple custom exception that extends Python's built-in Exception. It initializes with a message and optional errors, storing errors in an attribute. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, or network interactions. The code is minimal and typical for custom exception definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
