{
  "purpose": "A simple custom exception class for API error handling, designed to encapsulate error messages and optional error details.",
  "sources": "The class constructor accepts 'message' and 'errors' parameters; no external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; no sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the superclass constructor and are stored as attributes; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal custom exception class inheriting from Python's Exception. It initializes with a message and optional errors, passing the message to the superclass and storing errors as an attribute. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is clear, standard, and free of obfuscation or security issues. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
