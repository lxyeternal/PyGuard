  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward custom exception class (`ApiError`) inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - The class initializes with a message and optional errors, storing errors as an attribute.\n   - No external data sources, network interactions, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, indicating no malicious or risky behavior, no justification for higher risk scores is needed.\n   - The code is purely a utility class for error handling.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- The code is a minimal, standard pattern for custom exceptions in Python.\n- There are no hidden backdoors, secrets, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
