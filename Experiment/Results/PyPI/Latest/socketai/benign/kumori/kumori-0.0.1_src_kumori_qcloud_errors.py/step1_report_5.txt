{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for API errors to handle error messages and optional error details.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code only raises an exception.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; class definition alone does not process data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward exception subclassing.",
  "analysis": "The code simply creates a custom exception class named ApiError with an initializer that accepts a message and optional errors. It calls the superclass initializer with the message and stores errors as an instance attribute. There are no input/output operations, external communications, or code execution; it is purely a class definition. No hardcoded credentials, malicious logic, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic custom exception class with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a utility for error handling without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
