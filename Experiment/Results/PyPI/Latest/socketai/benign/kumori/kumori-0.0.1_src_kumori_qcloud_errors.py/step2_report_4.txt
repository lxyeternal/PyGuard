  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code defines a simple custom exception class `ApiError` with an `__init__` method that accepts a message and optional errors.\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no external data handling, network activity, or suspicious constructs.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as a standard pattern for custom exceptions.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are present in the analysis.\n   - The reasoning that the code is benign and typical is sound.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is justified.\n   - Since the code is purely a utility class with no external effects, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, network communication, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on objective observations; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n   - The code is transparent and standard.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
