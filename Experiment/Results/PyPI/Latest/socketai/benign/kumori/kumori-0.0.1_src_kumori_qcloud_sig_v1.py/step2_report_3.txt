  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code constructs request parameters via `expand()` and `compose()`.\n- It signs these parameters with HMAC-SHA1, base64-encoded.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- The code appears to be a standard API request signing implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, standard API signing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward, and the low malware score aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Slight concern about `expand()` handling complex data, but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The mention of potential misuse of `expand()` is valid but does not indicate malicious activity.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Similar to above; standard request signing, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Slightly lower security risk score reflects minimal concern.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** No signs of malicious activity, standard cryptographic signing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Standard request signing, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation (0.1-0.2), justified by the lack of input validation or secret management concerns, but not malicious.\n\n### Final notes:\n- The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The use of HMAC with a secret key is standard for API request signing.\n- The redundant assignment of `'Nonce'` in `compose()` is a minor flaw but not malicious.\n- No evidence suggests supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n## **Final estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (low, due to potential issues like lack of input validation, but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of request signing, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign but could be improved with input validation and secret management practices.",
