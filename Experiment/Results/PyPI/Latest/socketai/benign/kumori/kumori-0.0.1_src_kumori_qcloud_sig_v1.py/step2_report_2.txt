  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations from the code:**\n\n- The code constructs request parameters via `expand()` and `compose()`.\n- It signs the assembled parameters with HMAC-SHA1, base64-encoded.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network activity.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code patterns.\n- The only minor issue is the redundant assignment of `'Nonce'` in `compose()`, which is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report**\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard API request signing with HMAC.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The reasoning is sound. The low security risk reflects the potential for misuse if secrets are mishandled externally, but this is outside the code scope.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar API signing process.\n- **Findings:** Straightforward, with a note on the recursive `expand()` potentially creating complex structures if inputs are maliciously crafted.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No malicious intent detected. The note on `expand()`'s potential misuse is reasonable but does not imply maliciousness here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Again, request signing.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation or malicious code; redundant `'Nonce'` assignment noted but harmless.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The low security risk reflects standard signing, assuming secret key management is external.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar signing process.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns; standard cryptographic operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard request signing.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior; only a minor redundancy.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. The code appears legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly varies between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting minimal external risks mainly related to secret management, not code itself.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 in all, appropriate given the consistent analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment**\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of request signing using HMAC-SHA1 and base64 encoding.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The only concern is external secret management, which is outside this code snippet.\n\n### **Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.1 - 0.2** |\n\nGiven the uniformity and the lack of any suspicious activity, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (leaning towards minimal risk, assuming external secret management)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard request signing implementation with no malicious or obfuscated content. The minor security risk pertains to secret key handling outside this code scope, not within the code itself.",
