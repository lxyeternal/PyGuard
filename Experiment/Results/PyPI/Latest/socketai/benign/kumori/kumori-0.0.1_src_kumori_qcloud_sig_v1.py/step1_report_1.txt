{
  "purpose": "The code constructs request parameters and signs them using HMAC for authentication, likely for API requests.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'args' parameter in 'expand' and 'compose', as well as 'kwargs' in 'sign'.",
  "sinks": "The generated HMAC signature is returned as base64-encoded data; no other sensitive data is output or transmitted by this code.",
  "flows": "Data from 'args' and 'kwargs' flow into the 'expand' function and then into 'compose', culminating in the 'sign' function where signing occurs using 'skey'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The 'skey' parameter is externally supplied and used for signing, which is standard. No suspicious code paths or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code generates a structured set of request parameters via 'compose' and 'expand'. The 'sign' function constructs a string from sorted parameters and signs it with HMAC-SHA1 using the provided secret key. The implementation appears to be a typical API signing process without any malicious logic. No external data is fetched, and no dangerous functions or network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for signing API requests with HMAC. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities in this isolated snippet.",
