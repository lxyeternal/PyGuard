  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of API request signing using HMAC-SHA1 and base64 encoding. There is no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The minor issues identified do not elevate the security risk significantly. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to potential misuse if inputs are maliciously crafted, but this is outside the code's scope."
