  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without specific context, it is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, hardcoded strings, and possibly input functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, outputs data via print statements, or sends data over network sockets.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or inputs flows into processing functions, which may then output or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No suspicious network activity or hidden functions observed. The code uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from environment variables and inputs, processes it using standard functions, and may output data or write to files. No signs of malicious payloads, such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or system modifications. Usage of common modules and lack of obscure constructs suggest benign intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic identified. The code structure appears straightforward and typical for utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code seems benign and standard in nature. Confidence in this conclusion is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
