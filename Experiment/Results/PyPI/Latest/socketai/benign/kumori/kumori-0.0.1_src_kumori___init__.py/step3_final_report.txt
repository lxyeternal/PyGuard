  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data reading from environment variables, data processing functions, network connections, file I/O, user input, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network communication (sending data, connecting to domains), file system modifications, environment variable access, subprocess execution, data output.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into processing functions; outputs or network connections act as sinks where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no malicious activity, with scores reflecting low risk and no obfuscation. High confidence in benign assessment where code exists; absence of code leads to cautious but appropriate low-risk scores. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors identified. Scores are consistent with the descriptions, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and risk scores at 0.2, slightly conservative but justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code in all reports appears benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action required.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
