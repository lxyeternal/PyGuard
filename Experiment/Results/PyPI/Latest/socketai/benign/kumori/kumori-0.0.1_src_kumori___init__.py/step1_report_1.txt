  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the definition and usage of functions or classes, possibly related to some data processing or utility operations. Without additional context, it is likely intended for general application use.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external modules; possibly from files or network if present, but none are explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing to files, executing system commands, or network connections if any such code exists, but none are explicitly identified in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and potentially to output or side-effect actions such as system calls or network communications if present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious variable names are observed. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is evaluated step-by-step: checking the initial definitions for input handling, examining processing logic for malicious patterns like code injection or data leaks, reviewing any external calls for suspicious activity, and assessing for obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network communications with untrusted domains, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration, are detected. The code structure and format are clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code appears to be benign and well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
