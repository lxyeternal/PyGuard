  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, static package metadata fields (name, version, author, email, url, description).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment from variables and file read; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads static metadata and a local README file, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0, with high confidence. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and standard pattern support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is benign, standard, and free of security issues. All evidence indicates no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code.",
