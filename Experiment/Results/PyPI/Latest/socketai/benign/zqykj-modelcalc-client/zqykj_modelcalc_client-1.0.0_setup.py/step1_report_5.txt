{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'zqykj_modelcalc_client' including its dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies, package discovery via find_packages(), reading README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or code execution; no external system calls or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the code is limited to package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed. Use of external file 'README.md' is standard, no malicious content evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, dependencies, author info, and metadata, including reading the README.md file for long description. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or network operations that could be malicious. All code is typical for Python packaging, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It merely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
