  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'zqykj_modelcalc_client'.",
  "sources": "Reads package dependencies from 'install_requires' and metadata fields such as author and email.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The setup process reads the package dependencies and metadata, but no data flows are evident from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. The code mainly defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging. It defines package metadata including name, version, author, email, description, and dependencies. The 'long_description' reads content from 'README.md'. There are no dynamic code execution, input validation, or network operations that could be malicious. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malware signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely handles package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious activities.",
