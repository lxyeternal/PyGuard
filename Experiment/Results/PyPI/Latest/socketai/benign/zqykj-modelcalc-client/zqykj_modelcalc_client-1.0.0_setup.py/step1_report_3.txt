{
  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'zqykj_modelcalc_client', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from 'README.md' for long description and from the 'setuptools' functions for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data; the only potential concern is reading 'README.md' which is a static file.",
  "flows": "Input (reading 'README.md') flows into package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setup() function from setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and requirements. It reads a local file 'README.md' for long description, which is typical. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behaviors are observed. Dependencies are explicit and benign. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs package configuration tasks safely and transparently.",
