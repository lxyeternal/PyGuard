{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'zqykj_modelcalc_client'.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies, reading 'README.md' file for long description, reading package metadata such as author and email.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or external systems.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow paths identified; data read is static or from package files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets (besides author email), or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and dependencies. The only external input is the 'README.md' file for long_description, which is a common practice. The author email appears legitimate and formatted correctly. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is present. No hardcoded credentials or other anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal package configuration file.",
