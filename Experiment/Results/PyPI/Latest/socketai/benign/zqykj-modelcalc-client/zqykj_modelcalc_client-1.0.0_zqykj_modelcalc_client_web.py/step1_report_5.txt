{
  "purpose": "This code provides a client for interacting with a financial modeling API, including request handling, response processing, and error management.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as base_url, rule_id, model_id, task_id, and protocol_data. It also reads from HTTP responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of response.json() for data parsing, and the session.get/post methods which send requests to specified URLs. The code does not execute untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into URL constructions and request payloads, then from HTTP responses into JSON parsing and return values. Error handling may re-raise exceptions with error details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are observed. There are standard API request and response handling patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Error handling is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical API client operations: constructing URLs, sending GET and POST requests, handling responses, and managing errors through custom exceptions. The _handle_response function checks for HTTP errors and parses JSON responses safely. No untrusted data execution, credential leaks, or malicious patterns are identified. Usage of requests.Session() is standard for connection pooling. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client implementation without malicious intent. It securely handles HTTP responses and encapsulates API interactions. There are no indications of supply chain attacks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.",
