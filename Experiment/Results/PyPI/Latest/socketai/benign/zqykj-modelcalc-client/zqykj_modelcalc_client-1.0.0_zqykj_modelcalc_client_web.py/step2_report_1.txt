  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is an API client with standard request handling, no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. Minor concern about untrusted input in URL parameters, but outside the code scope.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The only potential risk is external input sanitization, which is outside the code's control. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard API client, no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Well-reasoned. No evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard API client with no signs of malicious behavior. Potential concern about untrusted input in URL construction, but typical for such clients.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a straightforward API client, no malicious patterns. Risks involve misuse via malicious input, but this is outside the code scope.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard API client, no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Proper response handling and error management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activities are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) is reasonable, reflecting minimal external risks due to untrusted input in URL parameters, but nothing within the code indicates a security flaw.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — the only concern is external input sanitization, which is outside the code scope but worth noting.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and justified. The code appears safe, with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The minor security risk relates to external input handling, which is typical for API clients.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Keep malware=0, obfuscated=0.\n- Set securityRisk around 0.1–0.2, reflecting external input considerations but no internal flaws.\n\n**Note:** No changes needed to the scores based on the provided analysis.",
