{
  "purpose": "This code implements a client interface for interacting with a financial modeling API, providing methods to retrieve and manage rules, models, tasks, and protocols.",
  "sources": "URL construction using input parameters (rule_id, model_id, task_id, etc.), request payloads in execute methods, response JSON parsing.",
  "sinks": "Response JSON data returned or processed; potential for untrusted input in URL parameters or payloads if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are used to construct URLs and request data, which are sent via HTTP requests; responses are parsed and returned or used internally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with standard request handling and error management.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical API client utilizing the requests library, with dynamic URL construction based on input parameters. It handles responses and errors properly, with no embedded secrets or malicious code. The main concern is external input sanitization, which is outside the code scope but relevant for deployment. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's structure and logic are clear and standard for such clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API client with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security risk pertains to external input handling, which is outside the code's scope. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, reflecting typical external input considerations.",
