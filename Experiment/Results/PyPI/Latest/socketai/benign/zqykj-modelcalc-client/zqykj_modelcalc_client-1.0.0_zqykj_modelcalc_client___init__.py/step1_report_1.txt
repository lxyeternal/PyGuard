  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without specific comments or context, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'input_data' variable or data source, and possibly environment variables or external files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions or methods that output data, write to files, send data over the network, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like 'input_data' through processing functions, possibly reaching sinks such as output functions or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No clear anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are immediately apparent. However, if dynamic execution or indirect data flows are used, further inspection would be needed.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with import statements and variable initializations, which appear standard. No external or suspicious libraries are imported. The main logic processes input data with straightforward functions. No evident hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The code does not perform network communication or system modifications within the examined snippets. Without further context or hidden logic, no malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears to perform standard data processing tasks without suspicious activity.",
