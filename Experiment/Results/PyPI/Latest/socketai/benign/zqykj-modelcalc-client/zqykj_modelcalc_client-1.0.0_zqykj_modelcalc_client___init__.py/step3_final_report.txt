{
  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security risks and malicious behavior in the analyzed Python package code.",
  "sources": "Potential untrusted input sources, environment variables, dynamic imports, complex control flows, and external data interactions.",
  "sinks": "Dangerous functions ('exec', 'eval', 'subprocess'), data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or obfuscated code execution pathways.",
  "flows": "Input sources (untrusted data/env vars) potentially passing through dynamic execution or obfuscation layers to sinks like dangerous functions or network modules.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious obfuscation (high obfuscation score), use of dynamic imports, complex control flows, potential dangerous function usage, and lack of documentation or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in most reports, with some suspicion in Report 2 due to high obfuscation and potential dangerous functions. Reports 1, 3, 4, and 5 show minimal or no malicious indicators, with scores aligned to their descriptions. Report 2's suspicion justifies higher obfuscation and malware scores, but without concrete evidence, these are moderate. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the provided summaries, with slight adjustments to reflect cautious suspicion where warranted.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; Report 2 warrants moderate concern due to obfuscation and potential malicious functions. The scores are generally appropriate, with minor room for adjustment if further code details reveal more malicious activity.",
