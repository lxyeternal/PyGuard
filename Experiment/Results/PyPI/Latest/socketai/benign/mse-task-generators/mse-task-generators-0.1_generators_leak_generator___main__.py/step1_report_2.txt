{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for generating or verifying tasks using the LeaksGenerator module.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments '-m' (mode) and '-t' (task), which are untrusted user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'args.task' to instantiate LeaksGenerator and calls its methods 'create_task' or 'verify_task', which could potentially be sinks if those methods handle untrusted data insecurely.",
  "flows": "User input from command-line arguments flows into the 'LeaksGenerator' methods via 'args.task' parameter, which influences task creation or verification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed. The code appears straightforward, mainly handling input parameters and invoking methods.",
  "analysis": "The script processes command-line arguments to determine operation mode and task type, with default handling to enforce task type 3. It then initializes 'LeaksGenerator' with the task number and calls its methods accordingly. No malicious code or suspicious behavior is evident. There are no obfuscation techniques or hidden data flows. The main concern could be the 'LeaksGenerator' class's internal implementation, which is not provided, but based solely on this code, no malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign command-line interface for a task generator/verifier. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident within this snippet. The security risk is low, assuming 'LeaksGenerator' is a trusted component.",
