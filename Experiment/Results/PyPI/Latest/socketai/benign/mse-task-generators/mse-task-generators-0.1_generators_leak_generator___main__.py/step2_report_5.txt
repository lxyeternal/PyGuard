  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Obfuscated Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n   - The code simply parses command-line arguments, enforces a default task value, and calls methods on an external class.\n\n2. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks:**\n   - The only possible concern is the external `LeaksGenerator` class, which isn't provided. However, based on the code snippet, there's no indication that it performs malicious actions.\n   - User input is limited to `-m` and `-t` options, with choices enforced for `-m`. The task defaults to 3 if another value is provided, with a message indicating only task 3 is supported.\n\n3. **Logic and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - The code logic is sound for its purpose. It correctly enforces choices and defaults.\n   - No flawed reasoning or suspicious logic is present.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: very low (0.1–0.2)\n   - These seem reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n5. **Claims about Potential Vulnerabilities:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize that core functionality depends on an external class.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities are based on unsupported assumptions.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The low malware and obfuscated scores are consistent with the code.\n   - The security risk scores are appropriately low, considering the external dependency.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, mainly depending on the external class, which isn't shown.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\nGiven the code and reports, I concur with the provided scores. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks within this snippet.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis.",
