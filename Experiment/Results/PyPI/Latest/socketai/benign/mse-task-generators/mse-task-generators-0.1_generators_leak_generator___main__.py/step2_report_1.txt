  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Presence of issues in the code:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around an external class `LeaksGenerator`.\n- There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The code handles user input securely and delegates core functionality to the external module.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the internal behavior of `LeaksGenerator` is unknown, which is crucial since malicious activity could be hidden there.\n- They note that the code itself appears benign and that the security risk is low, which is accurate.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n\n**Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which seems reasonable given the code snippet.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), aligning with the absence of suspicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n**Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- Since the code is a simple CLI wrapper with no internal malicious logic, higher scores are unjustified.\n- The risk depends heavily on the implementation of `LeaksGenerator`, which is external and unknown.\n- Given the information, a risk score above 0.2 would be unwarranted.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- No signs of malicious activity are present in this code snippet.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about the internal behavior of `LeaksGenerator`.\n- They correctly state that the core risk depends on external code.\n\n**Consistency of scores with the report:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis, all indicating low risk and no malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (since the code is a benign CLI wrapper, and actual risk depends on external implementation)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a minimal, standard CLI interface that delegates to an external module. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain low scores unless further inspection of `LeaksGenerator` reveals malicious behavior. The current assessment aligns with the provided code snippet.",
