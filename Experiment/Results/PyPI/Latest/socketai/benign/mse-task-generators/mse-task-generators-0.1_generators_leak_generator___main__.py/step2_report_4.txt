  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI wrapper that parses user input and delegates to an external class (`LeaksGenerator`) for core functionality.\n   - There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs.\n   - The code appears straightforward, with input validation and controlled method calls.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious Activity & Risks:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code itself does not perform any malicious actions—no network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident.\n   - The only concern is the external `LeaksGenerator` class, which is not provided. Its internal implementation could contain malicious or insecure code, but based solely on this snippet, no such issues are visible.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's apparent benign nature. No evidence suggests malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Very low (0.1 to 0.2). The code's security risk is minimal, assuming the external module is trustworthy.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume the external `LeaksGenerator` is safe, which is reasonable given the provided code.\n   - No suspicious behavior is inferred or claimed beyond the potential risk posed by the external module.\n\n5. **Score Consistency & Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - Given the lack of malicious or obfuscated code, the scores of 0 for malware and obfuscated, and low for security risk, are appropriate.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & Final Estimation:**\n   - Based on this code alone, **malware score should remain at 0**.\n   - **Obfuscated score** should stay at 0.\n   - **Risk score** could be slightly increased if considering the external dependency, but given no evidence of malicious behavior, keeping it low (around 0.1–0.2) is justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign CLI interface.\n- No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The main security concern is the external `LeaksGenerator`, which cannot be assessed here.\n- The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Keep security risk low, around 0.1–0.2, unless further information about `LeaksGenerator` suggests otherwise.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code appears safe and intentionally designed for leak task generation and verification, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
