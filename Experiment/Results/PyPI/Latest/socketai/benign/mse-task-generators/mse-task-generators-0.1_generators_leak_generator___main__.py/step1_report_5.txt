{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for generating or verifying tasks related to leak generation, likely for security testing or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments '-m' (mode) and '-t' (task).",
  "sinks": "Calls methods 'create_task' or 'verify_task' on the 'LeaksGenerator' object, which may internally process or handle data.",
  "flows": "Command-line inputs -> parsed arguments -> 'LeaksGenerator' methods called based on mode.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code. No suspicious external network calls or data exfiltration observed within this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments for mode and task, enforces a default task value, and instantiates 'LeaksGenerator' with the task number. It then invokes methods to generate or verify leak-related tasks. The usage of 'LeaksGenerator' suggests external processing, but within this code, no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unsafe operations, are present in this module.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward command-line interface for managing leak generation tasks. It relies on an external class 'LeaksGenerator' for core functionality. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks within this snippet.",
