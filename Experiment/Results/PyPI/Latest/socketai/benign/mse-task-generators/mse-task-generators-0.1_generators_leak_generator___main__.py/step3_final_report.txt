  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for generating or verifying leak tasks via the external LeaksGenerator module.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (-m/--mode, -t/--task) for mode and task selection.",
  "sinks": "Calls to LeaksGenerator methods (create_task, verify_task) which may process or generate data.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> argument parsing -> task validation -> LeaksGenerator instantiation -> method invocation based on mode.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward argument handling and delegation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI interface that parses user input, enforces a default task value, and delegates core functionality to an external class 'LeaksGenerator'. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets. The external module's behavior is unknown, so risks depend on its implementation. The code handles input securely and performs minimal processing. No network or file operations are visible. The logic is sound, with proper argument validation and default enforcement. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the simplicity and delegation to external code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI wrapper that delegates to an external leak generator module. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident within this snippet. The risk and malware scores are appropriate, assuming the external module is safe. The overall security posture based on this code is very low risk.",
