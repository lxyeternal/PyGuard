  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It’s a CLI wrapper that parses arguments (-m/--mode and -t/--task).\n- It enforces that task defaults to 3, with a message if a different task is provided.\n- It instantiates a `LeaksGenerator` with the task number.\n- Calls `create_task()` or `verify_task()` based on mode.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code are visible.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n- The code itself is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The external class `LeaksGenerator` is unknown; risks depend on its implementation.\n- The code does not handle or process untrusted data beyond command-line arguments.\n- No network, file, or system modifications are visible here.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: CLI for leak tasks.\n- Risk score: 0.1, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0.\n- Justified: No malicious behavior detected.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: CLI for leak tasks.\n- Risk: 0.2, Malware: 0.\n- Justified: No malicious activity, just passing arguments.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: CLI for leak tasks.\n- Risk: 0, Malware: 0.\n- Justified: No suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: CLI for leak tasks.\n- Risk: 0.2, Malware: 0.\n- Justified: No malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.8.\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: CLI for leak tasks.\n- Risk: 0.1, Malware: 0.\n- Justified: No malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports, consistent.\n- **Risk scores:** They are low, mostly 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The main concern would be the behavior of `LeaksGenerator`. Since its implementation isn't shown, we cannot fully assess its safety.\n- The code's logic is simple and safe, with no hidden or obfuscated parts.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable given the code snippet.\n- The malware score should remain 0 unless the external class is malicious.\n- The obfuscated score remains 0.\n- The risk score could be slightly increased if the external module is untrusted, but based solely on this code, staying at 0.1–0.2 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, assuming external class is safe)\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and justified. The code appears benign, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting minimal concern based on this snippet alone.",
