{
  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface to generate or verify tasks using the LeaksGenerator class.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments for mode and task type; it imports and instantiates the LeaksGenerator class.",
  "sinks": "The code calls methods 'create_task' and 'verify_task' on the generator instance, which may perform operations based on input data.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> parse args -> instantiate LeaksGenerator -> call create_task or verify_task methods",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Usage of a generator class imported from a specific module is typical.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up argument parsing with validation, ensuring only '1' or '2' for mode and defaulting task to 3 with a message if different. It then creates an instance of LeaksGenerator with the task number. Depending on mode, it calls either create_task or verify_task. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors. The class LeaksGenerator is external; its internal behavior is unknown, but the usage here appears straightforward and intended for task generation or verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a CLI interface to a task generator and verifier. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident from the provided code snippet. Risks depend on the implementation of LeaksGenerator, which is external and cannot be assessed here.",
