{
  "purpose": "The code is a command-line interface for generating or verifying leak-related tasks using the LeaksGenerator class.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments for mode and task, and imports the LeaksGenerator class from an external module.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or executes untrusted data; the main interactions are with the LeaksGenerator class methods create_task() and verify_task().",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed and used to instantiate LeaksGenerator with a task number, then calling methods based on mode.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The script straightforwardly parses arguments for mode and task, restricts task to a default value (3), and invokes methods on an imported class. It does not handle or process untrusted data beyond input arguments, nor does it perform any risky operations such as network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration. The use of an external class (LeaksGenerator) is standard, and without inspecting that class, no malicious intent can be inferred from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign command-line utility for generating or verifying leak tasks. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet.",
