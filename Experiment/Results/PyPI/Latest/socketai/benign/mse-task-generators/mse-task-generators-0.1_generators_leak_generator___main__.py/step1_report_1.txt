{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface to generate or verify leak-related tasks using the LeaksGenerator module.",
  "sources": "User input from command-line arguments (-m/--mode and -t/--task).",
  "sinks": "Methods called on the LeaksGenerator instance: create_task() and verify_task(), which may internally process data based on input.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> argparse parsing -> args -> LeaksGenerator instance -> create_task() or verify_task().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code imports a potentially sensitive module but does not itself perform sensitive operations or contain obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code uses argparse to parse command-line arguments, enforcing choices for mode and defaulting the task to 3. It initializes a LeaksGenerator with the task number and calls methods based on mode. There are no signs of malicious logic, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The usage appears standard for a CLI utility delegating operations to an external class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface for leak generation and verification, with no apparent malicious intent or security issues. It relies on external modules for core functionality, which are not shown here; thus, risks depend on their implementation. Based solely on this code, it appears safe.",
