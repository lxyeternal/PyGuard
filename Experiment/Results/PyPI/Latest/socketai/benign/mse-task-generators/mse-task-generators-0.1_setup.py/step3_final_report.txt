  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script configuring package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; defining dependencies; specifying CLI commands via 'entry_points'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or execution; entry points define scripts but do not execute malicious code within this script.",
  "flows": "Setup configuration references external modules via entry points; no data flows indicating malicious activity within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic. Entry points merely define CLI commands pointing to external modules, which are outside the scope of this script. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The minimal security risk pertains to the trustworthiness of the external modules invoked via entry points, but the setup script itself is safe.",
