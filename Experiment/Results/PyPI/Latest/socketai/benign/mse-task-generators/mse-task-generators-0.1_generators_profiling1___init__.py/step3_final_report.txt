  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, use of eval/exec, hardcoded credentials, network activity, environment variables, and code structure.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as hardcoded secrets or eval/exec leading to malicious actions or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, eval/exec usage, suspicious network activity, obfuscation, and dynamic code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The reports indicate that benign code (Reports 1, 2, 4, 5) have low or zero scores for malware and obfuscation, with moderate confidence, consistent with limited or no suspicious features. Report 3 details multiple malicious indicators—hardcoded secrets, eval/exec, network activity, obfuscation—justifying high malware (0.75), obfuscated (0.7), and security risk (0.8) scores, with high confidence (0.8). The scores across all reports align with their descriptions, and no adjustments are necessary. The high suspicion in Report 3 warrants further investigation, but based on current data, the scoring is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The assessments and scores are consistent with the evidence provided. Benign reports are correctly scored low, while Report 3's suspicious features justify high malware and obfuscation scores. No further adjustments are needed at this stage.",
