  "purpose": "Define classes StaticArray and Counter for handling variable types, with StaticArray supporting indexed access.",
  "sources": "Initialization of class instances, potential input parameters for name, data_type, and size.",
  "sinks": "None directly present; no data output, external calls, or untrusted data handling detected.",
  "flows": "Creation of StaticArray instances with specified name, data_type, and size; accessing elements via __getitem__ which creates new Variable instances.",
  "anomalies": "Super().__init__ call uses 'array=size' instead of 'array=self.size' or similar, which might be a typo but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected. The class definitions are straightforward and do not include suspicious imports or operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes inheriting from Variable. StaticArray allows indexed access, creating new Variable instances for each element access. The use of 'array=size' in super().__init__ could be a typo but does not suggest malicious intent. No external data sources, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. No obfuscation or malware behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a simple class definition for handling variable collections.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of variable container classes without malicious behavior or security risks. Minor potential typo in the constructor call does not imply malicious intent.",
