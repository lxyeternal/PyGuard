  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward with a probable typo in the constructor call, but no malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The assigned scores are mostly appropriate, though risk scores should be slightly reduced from 0.8-0.9 to around 0.1-0.2 to better reflect the minor bug rather than a security threat."
