  "purpose": "This code is a comment explaining that the __init__.py file is added to ensure a package exists at each level in the Python project.",
  "sources": "The comment itself; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external interactions; the code contains only a comment.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution paths; the code is purely a comment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a single comment in Russian with no executable statements, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, benign comment serving as documentation for package structure. It contains no executable code, data input/output, or suspicious behavior. The comment is in Russian, explaining the purpose of adding an __init__.py file at each level. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. The code's benign nature and standard purpose in Python packaging are confirmed by all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, serving solely as a documentation comment. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present. The scores and assessments in all reports are accurate and justified. No further action or increased risk scores are warranted.",
