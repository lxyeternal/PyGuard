  "malware": 0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "purpose": "Educational tool generating C code with deliberate memory leaks and pointer errors for testing and teaching purposes.",
  "sources": "User inputs for scenario selection, code generation functions, subprocess calls for compilation and Valgrind analysis, file I/O for reading/writing answers and logs.",
  "sinks": "System commands (gcc, valgrind), file writes (answers, logs), subprocess execution, user input handling for scenario parameters.",
  "flows": "User input influences code generation parameters -> generated code is compiled and run -> Valgrind output parsed for leak info -> answers are validated against stored responses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of user input without extensive validation, but within controlled educational context; deliberate insertion of memory errors for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed solely for educational purposes, intentionally creating faulty C programs with memory leaks and pointer errors. It compiles and runs these programs, then uses Valgrind to detect leaks, and validates student responses. No malicious network activity, backdoors, or harmful behaviors are present. The subprocess calls, file operations, and user inputs are standard and controlled. The minimal input validation does not pose a significant security risk in this context. The scores reflect the benign, educational nature of the code, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and a low security risk score (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, educational tool with no malicious intent or harmful behaviors. It relies on standard subprocess and file I/O operations, with user inputs influencing scenario parameters. The assigned scores are consistent with its purpose and behavior, indicating low security risk and no malware or obfuscation.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
