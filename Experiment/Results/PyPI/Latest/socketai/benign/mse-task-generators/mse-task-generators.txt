It relies on standard subprocess and file I/O operations, with user inputs influencing scenario parameters. The assigned scores are consistent with its purpose and behavior, indicating low security risk and no malware or obfuscation."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI wrapper that delegates to an external leak generator module. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident within this snippet. The risk and malware scores are appropriate, assuming the external module is safe. The overall security posture based on this code is very low risk."

The assigned scores are mostly appropriate, though risk scores should be slightly reduced from 0.8-0.9 to around 0.1-0.2 to better reflect the minor bug rather than a security threat."
