  "purpose": "Review open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input reading from environment variables, command-line arguments, files, or network; data flows from sources to sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or environment variable access.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, console output, temp file creation.",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or system modifications), potentially via dynamic code execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code observed; code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either empty, non-functional, or perform standard data processing without suspicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, network connections to suspicious domains, or malicious system modifications are detected. The use of environment variables, temp files, and console output aligns with typical utility scripts. The absence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns supports a benign assessment. The low risk scores (0.1-0.2) and malware score (0) are consistent with the observations. Confidence levels are high due to the straightforward nature of the code and lack of suspicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications necessary.",
