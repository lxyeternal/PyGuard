  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior; straightforward setup script; reads 'README.md' for description; dependencies are common; no code execution or malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; standard setup script; no anomalies; reads 'README.md' for description; dependencies are typical.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or security concern.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Identical to previous; standard packaging code; no suspicious activity; reads 'README.md'; no dynamic code or external calls.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.  \n- **Assessment:** Safe.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; no anomalies; standard setup; no suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Consistent with prior reports; standard setup script; no suspicious behavior or code obfuscation; dependencies are common.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.  \n- **Assessment:** No risks detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.  \n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0, justified as there's no security risk or malicious activity.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Scores:** The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.  \n- **Additional considerations:** Since the code only reads a README file and defines package metadata, there are no hidden or malicious behaviors to be concerned about.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is a standard setup script with no security issues or malware indications. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate for the package:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious or obfuscated content, and no security risks identified.",
