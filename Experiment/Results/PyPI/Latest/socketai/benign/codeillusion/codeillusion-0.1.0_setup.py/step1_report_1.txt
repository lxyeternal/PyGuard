{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'codeillusion', including its dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file to get the long description.",
  "targets": "There are no explicit sinks that process untrusted input or data, as this is a setup script.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'README.md' file read operation into the 'long_description' parameter of setup(), with no other data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a straightforward setup configuration with no suspicious or unusual code behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or malicious instructions are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and dependencies. The only file read is the 'README.md', which is typical for package descriptions. There are no network calls, dynamic code execution, or other suspicious activities. The dependencies listed are common scientific libraries. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a normal, benign configuration file for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks.",
