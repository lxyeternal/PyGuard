{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'codeillusion', used for code visualization and animation.",
  "sources": "Reads package requirements from 'install_requires', reads 'README.md' for long description, and reads package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks data.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'install_requires' and 'long_description' are used for package setup metadata; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual constructs; standard setup script with straightforward package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setuptools setup configuration. It specifies package information, dependencies, author details, and description. There are no functions, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, or data handling that could indicate malicious activity. The reading of 'README.md' is typical for including long descriptions, and the dependencies listed are common scientific libraries. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for an open-source project.",
