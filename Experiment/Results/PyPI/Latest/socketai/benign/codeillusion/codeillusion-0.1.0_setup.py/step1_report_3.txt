{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'codeillusion' Python project.",
  "sources": "Static data such as package name, version, author info, description, and dependencies; reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or system modification activities detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; typical package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code observed. The 'open' call for 'README.md' is standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies, with standard practices for reading a README file. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or other suspicious behaviors are present. The dependencies are common packages used for data visualization and graph processing. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical Python package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves its purpose of packaging the project securely and transparently.",
