{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'codeillusion', intended for package distribution via PyPI or other repositories. It defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file to extract the long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The only flow is from reading 'README.md' into the 'long_description' parameter, which is a common practice in setup scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools. It calls setup() with package metadata, including name, version, packages, dependencies, author info, description, URL, and classifiers. The only file read operation is opening 'README.md' for the long_description, which is a typical pattern. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or potentially malicious constructs are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks with no anomalies or malware indicators.",
