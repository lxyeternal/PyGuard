{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'codeillusion', including package discovery and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None present; no handling of untrusted input or data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools for packaging. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, author info, and reads a README file for description. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or other suspicious behaviors. The read operation on 'README.md' is typical for package description and not malicious. The overall structure is conventional and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
