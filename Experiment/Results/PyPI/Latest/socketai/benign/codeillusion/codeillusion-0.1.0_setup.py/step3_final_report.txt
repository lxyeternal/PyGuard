  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; no other data inputs or external sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or malicious effects detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code executes only package setup functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, well-structured setup script with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and reads a README file. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious logic. All dependencies are common scientific libraries. The code's simplicity and standard pattern indicate benign intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of zero, with full confidence. The code aligns with best practices and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed setup.py script is a benign, standard package configuration file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
