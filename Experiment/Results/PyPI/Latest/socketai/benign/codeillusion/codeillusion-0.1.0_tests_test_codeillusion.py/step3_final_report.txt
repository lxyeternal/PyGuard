  "purpose": "Unit tests for the CodeIllusion class, executing code snippets via run_code to verify correct behavior and error handling.",
  "sources": "Code snippets within test methods, particularly the string code passed to run_code.",
  "sinks": "The run_code method which executes the provided code strings, potentially executing untrusted code if misused.",
  "flows": "Code snippets are passed to run_code; if run_code executes them via exec or eval, untrusted code could flow from input to execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code snippets are simple, controlled, and do not contain suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a controlled test suite executing predefined code snippets. The run_code method's implementation is unknown but presumed safe within tests. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The main risk lies in run_code executing arbitrary code, which is acceptable here due to controlled inputs. Scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code and the controlled environment. The assessments correctly recognize the potential danger of executing arbitrary code but consider the context safe. Overall, the code shows no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main concern is the inherent risk of executing arbitrary code via run_code, but within this controlled testing context, the risk is minimal. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
