  "purpose": "Unit testing class for the CodeIllusion module, verifying code execution and state management.",
  "sources": "Input code strings in run_code method, environment context in run_code method, code from test cases.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe code execution if run_code executes malicious code; data added to visualization via add_state.",
  "flows": "Code string passed to run_code -> executed within CodeIllusion -> modifies context and data states.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, standard test patterns, no obfuscated code or external malicious calls.",
  "analysis": "The script contains only standard unittest setup, test cases, and method calls on CodeIllusion. The core function run_code appears to execute arbitrary code, but in this context, it is used to run predefined code snippets within a controlled test environment. There are no indications of malicious payloads, external network activity, or backdoors. The add_state method is used for visualization data management, not for malicious activities. Overall, the code performs straightforward testing operations with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit testing script with no malicious or security risks. The run_code function could execute arbitrary code, but in this controlled test scenario, it is used safely. No malware, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
