  "purpose": "Unit testing for the CodeIllusion class, focusing on executing code snippets, handling errors, and adding visualization states.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'code' string for execution, reading 'context' dictionary, calling methods of CodeIllusion class.",
  "sinks": "Executing code via run_code method, which could potentially run arbitrary code depending on implementation.",
  "flows": "Input code flows into run_code method, which executes the code; data added to context and internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No external network calls or hidden behaviors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of unit tests that instantiate and interact with the CodeIllusion class. It runs snippets of code, tests for errors, and adds states. The code snippets are simple Python code, with no input from untrusted sources other than the test strings. The run_code method's implementation is unknown; if it executes the provided code directly, it could be potentially dangerous if used with untrusted input. However, within the test context, it is used with controlled code snippets. No malicious behavior or anomalies are detected. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs controlled unit testing of the CodeIllusion class, primarily executing predefined Python code snippets within a test framework. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The use of run_code should be safe in this context, assuming the method executes code securely. Overall, the code appears to be a benign test suite with no signs of malware or security risks.",
