  "purpose": "Unit testing for the CodeIllusion class, verifying code execution, error handling, and state management.",
  "sources": "The code reads input in the form of string code snippets passed to run_code method; no other data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "The run_code method executes arbitrary code, which could potentially be malicious if run with untrusted input, but here it appears to be standard code execution within a controlled context.",
  "flows": "Code snippets are executed via run_code, which interprets the code string; data is stored or checked within context or class data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious anomalies detected; the code performs typical unit test setup and execution, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite for the CodeIllusion class, involving executing simple Python code snippets, error handling, and state management. It uses run_code to interpret code strings in a controlled context. No external network, file access, or security-sensitive operations are observed. The code appears safe and typical for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign test suite with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. The use of run_code to execute arbitrary code is typical for such testing, assuming run_code is implemented securely. There are no signs of supply chain attack, malware, or security risks.",
