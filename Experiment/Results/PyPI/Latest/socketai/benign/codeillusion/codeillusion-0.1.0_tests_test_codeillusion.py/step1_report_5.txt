  "purpose": "Unit testing for the CodeIllusion class to verify code execution, error handling, and state addition.",
  "sources": "Code inputs include the 'code' strings within test methods; no external data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "The run_code method executes arbitrary code, which is a potential sink if input is untrusted; no other explicit sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input code strings flow into run_code, which executes them, possibly affecting the 'context' dictionary; test assertions analyze the results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unittest framework setup, testing the functionality of the CodeIllusion class. It runs arbitrary code snippets within controlled tests, which is common for code execution testing. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as network communication, file system tampering, or data exfiltration. The use of run_code on arbitrary code could be risky if exposed externally, but within a test suite, it appears to be safe. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs straightforward unit testing of the CodeIllusion class with no evidence of malicious or security-compromising behavior. The code executes dynamic code within a controlled test environment, which is typical for testing purposes. No malware or security risks are detected.",
