  "purpose": "Unit tests for the CodeIllusion class, testing code execution, error handling, and state addition.",
  "sources": "Code input strings in test methods, especially in run_code method calls.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; code runs within controlled test environment, with no data exfiltration or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input code is executed via run_code, then variables are checked in the context object; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious function calls or external data access observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines unit tests for a class named CodeIllusion, focusing on safe code execution within a testing framework. The run_code method executes provided code snippets in a controlled context, with tests verifying correct variable assignment and error handling. No external inputs, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is standard test setup and execution code, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a safe, standard set of unit tests for a class handling code execution, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
