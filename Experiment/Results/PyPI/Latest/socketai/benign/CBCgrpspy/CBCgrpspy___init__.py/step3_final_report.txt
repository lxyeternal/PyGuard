{
  "purpose": "This code re-exports specific functions/classes from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .CBCgrpspy module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import from local module, then export via __all__; no data flow beyond module boundaries.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import from a local module and explicitly exports three symbols. It contains no malicious code, no network activity, no data leaks, and no obfuscation. The import path indicates a local module, which is typical in package structures. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this pattern. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export pattern with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
