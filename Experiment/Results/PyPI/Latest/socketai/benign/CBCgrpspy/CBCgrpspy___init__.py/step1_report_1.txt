{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up module exports for functions or classes imported from a local module named CBCgrpspy.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .CBCgrpspy, which loads code from a local module file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated or complex logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions or classes from a local module named CBCgrpspy and explicitly exports them. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network calls, data leaks, or code injection. The code is a simple module setup with standard Python syntax, indicating typical usage without hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal module initialization file with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It simply exposes certain components from a local module for external use.",
