{
  "purpose": "Re-exports functions or classes 'twogrps', 'multigrps', and 'dataAnalysis' from the local module 'CBCgrpspy'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from a local module '.CBCgrpspy'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform operations that could leak data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code only re-exports symbols from an imported module.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is minimal and standard for module exports; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement and an __all__ definition to specify exported symbols. There are no apparent malicious behaviors, no data handling, and no suspicious patterns. The imported module '.CBCgrpspy' could be examined separately, but based on this snippet alone, nothing indicates malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module that re-exports certain functions or classes. No malicious or security risks are evident from this code snippet.",
