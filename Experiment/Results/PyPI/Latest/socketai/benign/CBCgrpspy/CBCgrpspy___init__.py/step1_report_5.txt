  "purpose": "Export specific functions from the CBCgrpspy module for external use",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module .CBCgrpspy",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or insecure operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to sensitive operations or outputs",
  "anomalies": "Only a standard import and __all__ declaration, no suspicious code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions (twogrps, multigrps, dataAnalysis) from a local module and exposes them via __all__. This is a typical pattern for defining module exports. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal, clean, and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving to organize module exports without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
