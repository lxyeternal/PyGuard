  "sources": "Import statement importing from .CBCgrpspy, which is a relative import of a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data or untrusted inputs are processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static import and export definitions are present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of specific functions or classes from a local module named CBCgrpspy and then explicitly defines the public API via __all__. There is no dynamic execution, external data processing, or suspicious behavior. The structure is standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic module export statement with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
