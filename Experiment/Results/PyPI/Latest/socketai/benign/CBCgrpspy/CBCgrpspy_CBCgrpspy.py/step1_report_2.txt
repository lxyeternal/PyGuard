{
  "purpose": "The script performs statistical data analysis including chi-square tests, Fisher's exact test, Mann-Whitney U test, t-tests, ANOVA, and non-parametric tests on datasets provided via CSV or Excel files, with functionalities for multiple group comparisons and results exporting.",
  "sources": "Reads data from CSV or XLSX files; accesses columns and data within dataframes; utilizes random seed setting for permutation testing.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks; the code does not send data over networks or write secrets to files; results are exported to Excel files locally.",
  "flows": "Data is read from files, processed in pandas dataframes, statistical functions receive data from these dataframes, and results are written to Excel files; no external network or untrusted output flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspiciously unusual code structures. Use of random seed for reproducibility in permutation tests is standard. Extensive statistical analysis functions are present but do not appear malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common data analysis libraries and defines multiple functions for statistical testing and data comparison, including permutation testing for contingency tables. It processes datasets, performs various statistical tests based on data type and distribution, and exports results to Excel. The logic includes safeguards against invalid input, uses standard statistical libraries, and does not contain code that sends or leaks data, execute commands, or access system secrets. The code appears to be a comprehensive statistical analysis tool with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a non-malicious, complex statistical analysis script designed for data exploration and comparison. It does not exhibit malware behaviors, malicious data handling, or suspicious network activities. Its primary function is statistical testing and reporting, with no evidence of sabotage or malicious intent.",
