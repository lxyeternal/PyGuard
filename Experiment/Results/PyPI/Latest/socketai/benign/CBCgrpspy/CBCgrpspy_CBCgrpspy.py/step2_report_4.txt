  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, potential risks, and the consistency of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code performs standard statistical tests, reading from CSV/XLSX files, using pandas, numpy, scipy—nothing suspicious.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Results are exported to Excel; no network activity or external data transmission.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious commands.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate statistical analysis tool, with no malicious intent or backdoors detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, given it's a statistical tool with no evident vulnerabilities)  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard data analysis functions, no suspicious activities.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Results saved to Excel, no network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate statistical analysis script, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, standard analysis code)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Performs standard statistical tests, reading from CSV/XLSX, exporting results.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Writes to Excel, no network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious commands.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Serves as a typical data analysis utility, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar statistical testing functions, reading datasets, outputting to Excel.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or external data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate data analysis code, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Performs statistical tests, with data read/write operations, no suspicious activities.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Results to Excel, no network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No hidden or malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard statistical analysis utility, safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (still low, as it's a statistical tool with minimal external risks)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varying but all very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the low external security risk of a statistical analysis script.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the scores assigned. The code is a legitimate, well-structured statistical analysis utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or supply chain risks.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** ~0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code appears safe, with no security threats or malicious behaviors detected.",
