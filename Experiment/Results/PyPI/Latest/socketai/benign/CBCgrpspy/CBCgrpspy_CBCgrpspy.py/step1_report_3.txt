{
  "purpose": "The script performs statistical analysis on datasets, including chi-squared tests, Fisher's exact tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, t-tests, and ANOVA, to compare groups and analyze variables, then exports results to Excel.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from CSV or Excel files specified by df_path, and it reads the dataset columns to identify variables for analysis. It also reads input data via pandas functions and numpy random functions.",
  "sinks": "The code writes analysis results to Excel files ('twogrps.xlsx' and 'multigrps.xlsx') and prints dataframes. No network, system modification, or data exfiltration actions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input into pandas DataFrame, is processed with statistical functions, and results are saved into Excel files. The code also uses random seed setting for reproducibility in permutations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code are evident. Use of random seed is standard for reproducibility. All external functions are from well-known libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy). The only potentially unusual behavior is extensive use of statistical tests and result export, but these are standard analytical practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical analysis on datasets for group comparisons and variable distributions. It reads data from specified files, processes data with standard statistical tests, and outputs results into Excel files. No network operations, code injection, data theft, or system modifications are observed. The code does not include obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious payloads. Usage of numpy's random seed in Monte Carlo permutation testing is appropriate for reproducibility. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate data analysis purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard statistical analysis script that processes datasets for group comparisons and reports results. No evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware is present. It relies on well-established libraries and functions. The only notable aspect is its extensive statistical testing, which is consistent with data analysis workflows.",
