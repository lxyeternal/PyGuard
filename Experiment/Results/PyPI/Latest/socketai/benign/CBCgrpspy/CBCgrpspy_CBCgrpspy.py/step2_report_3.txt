  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the validity of the scoring, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code performs standard statistical tests and reads data from CSV/XLSX files or pandas DataFrames. No suspicious activity is indicated.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The reviewer finds no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious commands. Use of random seed in permutation tests is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The analysis concludes the code is legitimate, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.2, which seems reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Are issues present?** No.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** The code is standard statistical analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, performing statistical tests, reading data, no suspicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. Extensive statistical functions, but all legitimate.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), malware=0, risk=0.1. The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Are issues present?** No.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are reasonable.  \n- **Justification:** The code is a typical data analysis script with no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Performs statistical tests, outputs to Excel, similar to previous reports.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), malware=0, risk=0.1. The report's reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Are issues present?** No.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** The code is consistent with legitimate data analysis tools.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar statistical analysis functions, reading datasets, outputting to Excel.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. No network or system modification behaviors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (0.95), malware=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Are issues present?** No.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Performs hypothesis testing, data summarization, exporting results. No suspicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious commands. Uses random seed for reproducibility, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), malware=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Are issues present?** No.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a comprehensive, legitimate statistical analysis tool. It performs various hypothesis tests, handles different data types, and outputs results to files.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors across all reports.\n- **Security Risk:** The risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), which aligns with the code's purpose as a statistical utility.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1-0.2** — Slightly elevated due to file handling and statistical complexity, but overall very low.\n\n**Note:** The code does not contain any network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage mechanisms. Its sole purpose is statistical analysis, and all behaviors are consistent with that.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are reasonable, and there are no indications of supply chain security issues or malicious intent. The code is safe and legitimate.",
