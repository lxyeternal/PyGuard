{
  "purpose": "This code performs statistical analysis on datasets, including various tests such as chi-squared, Fisher's exact, Mann-Whitney U, t-tests, ANOVA, and Kruskal-Wallis, and outputs results to Excel files.",
  "sources": "File input from CSV or XLSX files, reading data into pandas DataFrames; data from DataFrame columns during analysis.",
  "sinks": "Generated Excel files ('twogrps.xlsx', 'multigrps.xlsx') containing analysis results; no network, system, or sensitive data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Reads data from input files -> performs statistical computations -> writes results to Excel files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or misleading variable names; no suspicious data handling or hidden network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly imports statistical libraries and defines functions for data analysis, including chi-squared tests, Fisher's exact tests, Mann-Whitney U, t-tests, ANOVA, and Kruskal-Wallis. It reads datasets from specified CSV or XLSX files, processes categorical and numerical variables, performs multiple statistical tests based on data characteristics, and outputs results to Excel files. The functions include logic for handling small sample sizes, expected value checks, and data distribution assessments. There are no network communications, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors. The code's structure and content appear to serve legitimate statistical analysis purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a comprehensive statistical analysis tool designed for dataset examination. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. Its data handling and output procedures are consistent with legitimate analysis workflows. No signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious intent are present.",
