{
  "purpose": "The code performs statistical data analysis and hypothesis testing on datasets, including chi-squared tests, Fisher's exact test, Mann-Whitney U test, t-tests, Kruskal-Wallis test, and ANOVA, with the ability to handle datasets with two or multiple groups and output results to Excel files.",
  "sources": "The code reads input datasets from CSV or Excel files specified by the user, and reads data from pandas DataFrames. It also uses numpy for random seed setting and calculations.",
  "sinks": "The code generates output Excel files with statistical summaries; no other data output sinks are evident. No untrusted data is written to external systems other than files.",
  "flows": "Input files are read into pandas DataFrames. Data is processed through statistical functions, with conditional branches for different test types, and results are written to Excel files. No network transmission or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, backdoors, or hidden functionalities detected. Use of random seed setting for permutation tests is standard. The code appears to be a comprehensive statistical analysis tool, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious commands. Commented-out code is benign. No anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary libraries for statistical analysis, then defines functions for Monte Carlo Fisher's exact test, pairwise group comparison (twogrps), multi-group comparison (multigrps), and a main data analysis orchestrator (dataAnalysis). Each function performs standard statistical tests based on data types, with conditions to select appropriate tests, and outputs results to Excel. No code snippets indicate data exfiltration, command execution, or malicious activity. The functions handle input validation and output formatting. Random seed setting is used for reproducibility in permutation tests. Overall, the code implements standard statistical procedures without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate statistical analysis utility designed for data exploration and hypothesis testing. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms. It processes data securely and outputs results to files without exposing or transmitting sensitive information. No malware or security risks are detected.",
