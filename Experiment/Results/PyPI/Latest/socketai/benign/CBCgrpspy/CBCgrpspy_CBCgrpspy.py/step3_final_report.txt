{
  "purpose": "The code performs comprehensive statistical analyses, including chi-squared tests, Fisher's exact test, Mann-Whitney U, t-tests, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and permutation-based tests, on datasets read from CSV or Excel files, and outputs results to Excel files.",
  "sources": "Reads data from CSV or XLSX files using pandas; processes data with numpy and scipy; no external network or untrusted input sources involved.",
  "sinks": "Exports analysis results to Excel files; no network activity or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Data is read from files, processed through statistical functions, and results are written to output files; no external communication or suspicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Use of random seed in permutation tests is standard for reproducibility.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard data analysis libraries and functions, performing legitimate statistical tests on datasets. It handles different data types appropriately, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. Random seed setting is used for reproducibility, which is common practice. No network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage mechanisms are present. The logic is straightforward, and the code's purpose aligns with typical statistical analysis workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, comprehensive statistical analysis utility with no malicious or suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned in the initial reports are appropriate. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The overall security risk is very low, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
