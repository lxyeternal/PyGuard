{
  "purpose": "This code performs statistical analysis and data visualization, including hypothesis testing, data summarization, and exporting results to Excel files.",
  "sources": "Reads data from CSV or Excel files; uses numpy, pandas, scipy.stats functions; generates random permutations for Monte Carlo tests.",
  "sinks": "Exports data to Excel files; uses numpy.random for random permutations; no apparent untrusted output or system command execution.",
  "flows": "Reads input data from files -> processes data through statistical tests and data manipulation -> outputs results to Excel files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious variable names; use of random seed for reproducibility but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical tests such as chi-squared, Fisher's exact, Mann-Whitney U, t-tests, and Kruskal-Wallis, with comprehensive handling of different data types and conditions. It generates permutation-based p-values to handle small sample issues. Results are exported to Excel files for further review. No code indicates network activity, data exfiltration, or system harm. Random seed usage is for test reproducibility, not malicious. The code does not contain hidden backdoors, remote command execution, or malicious data handling mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard statistical analysis utility with comprehensive handling of various data types and tests. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain threats are evident. It is safe for use from a security perspective.",
