  "purpose": "Descriptive comment and version info for MCP server and client implementation for WhiteBit exchange",
  "sources": "None; only a docstring and version string present",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or execution logic",
  "anomalies": "None; purely descriptive, no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code snippet contains only a documentation string and a version declaration with no executable code, data handling, or network operations. There are no sources, sinks, or data flows that could lead to security vulnerabilities. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. Given the minimal content, the likelihood of malicious behavior or security risks is negligible. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code. Confidence levels are high due to the simplicity of the snippet, and no assumptions of malicious intent are warranted.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely descriptive with no executable or security-sensitive content. All assessments and scores indicating no malicious activity or security risks are justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary based on this fragment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
