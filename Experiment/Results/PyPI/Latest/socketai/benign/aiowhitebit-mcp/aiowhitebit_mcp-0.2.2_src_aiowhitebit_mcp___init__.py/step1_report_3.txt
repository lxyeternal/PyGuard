  "anomalies": "Minimal code; only version declaration and descriptive comments; no suspicious code or secrets detected",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a descriptive comment and a version string. There is no functional or operational code present, such as data handling, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. As such, no anomalies, malicious behavior, or security risks are identifiable in this fragment. It appears to be a placeholder or documentation stub for a larger implementation.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this limited code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It is likely part of a larger project, but this segment alone does not pose any security concerns.",
