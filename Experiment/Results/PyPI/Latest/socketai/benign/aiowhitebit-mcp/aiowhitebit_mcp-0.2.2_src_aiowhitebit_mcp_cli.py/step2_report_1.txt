  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code and the provided assessments.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that parses user inputs and delegates server creation and running to external functions (`create_server` and `server.run`).  \n- There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors within this script.  \n- The parameters passed are standard and are handled via safe argument parsing.  \n- The external functions are not provided, so potential issues within them cannot be assessed here, but based on this script alone, there are no immediate red flags.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 1 Review\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the script is a benign CLI wrapper with no malicious code. The low security risk score seems appropriate given the absence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 2 Review\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSimilar to report 1, it emphasizes the straightforward nature of the script. Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) may reflect a cautious stance due to reliance on external functions, but within this code, no vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 3 Review\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis aligns with the previous ones. The script is standard, with no malicious patterns. The high confidence score is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 4 Review\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments. The external functions are not visible, but within this script, no malicious activity is present.\n\n**Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 5 Review\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSame reasoning applies. The script is a typical CLI wrapper with no suspicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Scores:** The scores range from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concerns, mainly due to external dependencies not shown here. These are reasonable given the context.\n\n### My Overall Estimation\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, primarily due to external dependencies; no issues within this script.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. The code appears safe, and the scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate CLI wrapper for server configuration with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments provided.",
