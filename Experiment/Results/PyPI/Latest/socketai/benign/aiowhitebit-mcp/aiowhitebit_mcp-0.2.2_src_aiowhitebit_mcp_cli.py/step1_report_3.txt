  "purpose": "Command-line interface for configuring and running the WhiteBit MCP server with different transport protocols.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (--name, --transport, --host, --port) as input data sources.",
  "sinks": "The server.run() method, which initiates server operation based on provided parameters.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> create_server() -> server.run() with specified transport, host, and port.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of command-line args is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a CLI for setting up and running a server with configurable parameters. It uses argparse to parse input arguments and calls create_server() to instantiate the server. Depending on the transport choice, it runs the server with appropriate parameters. No data is processed from external untrusted sources beyond command-line arguments. No code injections, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident. The code appears straightforward and typical for a server CLI setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard CLI for server configuration without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies solely on user-provided arguments to control server behavior, with no hidden or malicious code detected.",
