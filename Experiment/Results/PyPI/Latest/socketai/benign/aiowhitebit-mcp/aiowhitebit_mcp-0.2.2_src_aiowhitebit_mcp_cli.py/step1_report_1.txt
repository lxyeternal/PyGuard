{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface to configure and run the WhiteBit MCP server with different transport protocols.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (--name, --transport, --host, --port).",
  "sinks": "Calls create_server and server.run() methods, which may execute server logic based on provided parameters.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> create_server() -> server.run() with transport, host, and port parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No data leakage, code injection, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up command-line argument parsing for server configuration, then initializes and runs the server based on user inputs. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code primarily facilitates server startup with configurable options. It relies on external 'create_server' and 'server.run' implementations, but within this script, there are no suspicious activities or security issues evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI wrapper for server configuration, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles user inputs securely and delegates server operations to external components.",
