{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface to configure and run a WhiteBit MCP server with different transport protocols.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments: --name, --transport, --host, --port",
  "sinks": "The data flows into the create_server function (via name argument) and server.run method (via transport, host, port arguments). These are the main points where data influences server behavior.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed and passed directly to server creation and run methods, determining server configuration based on user input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to set server parameters, then creates a server instance and runs it with the specified transport protocol, host, and port. There are no dynamic code executions, no user data beyond simple parameters, and no network or file operations involving untrusted data. The code appears to be a typical CLI setup for server configuration without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script for server configuration. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply translates user input into server startup parameters.",
