  "purpose": "Command-line interface for configuring and running the WhiteBit MCP server.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments: --name, --transport, --host, --port",
  "sinks": "Arguments passed to create_server() and server.run() functions",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed from CLI flow into create_server() and server.run() calls",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward argument parsing and delegation",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI wrapper that parses user input and delegates server creation and execution to external functions. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The parameters are handled safely via argparse. External functions are not provided, but within this script, no malicious or insecure behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI interface for server configuration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
