  "purpose": "Command-line interface for configuring and running the WhiteBit MCP server with different transport protocols.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments: --name, --transport, --host, --port",
  "screens": "The create_server function, server.run method",
  "flows": "User inputs via command-line → parsed arguments → server creation and configuration based on arguments",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual code patterns; no obfuscated code detected; no dynamic execution or external data fetching observed",
  "analysis": "The script provides a CLI for starting a server with configurable parameters. It safely handles user input via argparse, with predefined choices and defaults. The server is created with a name parameter, and then run with different transport options based on user selection. There are no apparent data leaks, code injections, or suspicious behaviors within this script. The create_server and server.run methods are external, but their usage here appears standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. Overall, the code appears straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a safe CLI wrapper for server initialization. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are evident within this code segment.",
