{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface to configure and run the WhiteBit MCP server with different transport protocols.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for server name, transport protocol, host, and port.",
  "sinks": "Passes untrusted command-line input (host, port, transport) directly into server.run() method.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> create_server() -> server.run() with parameters based on user input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code relies on external create_server which could be inspected separately but is not provided here. No obfuscated or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script securely parses command-line arguments using argparse. It sets defaults and allows user input for host, port, and transport protocol. The parameters are passed to create_server and server.run() without evident unsafe handling. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as network data exfiltration, command injection, or hidden backdoors. The code's structure is straightforward and aligns with standard CLI server setup patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign CLI wrapper for starting a server with configurable parameters. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this module. The only potential concern would be the implementation of create_server or server.run, which are external and not included here, but within this code snippet, there are no malicious indicators.",
