  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**1. Code Review and Presence of Issues:**\n- The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that accepts parameters and calls external functions (`create_server`, `server.run`). \n- There are no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network connections are present within this script.\n- The parameters are passed directly to external functions, which are not included here; their security implications depend on their implementation.\n\n**2. Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**\n- The code logic appears correct and standard for such CLI wrappers.\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the provided code snippet.\n\n**3. Scores and Reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9–1), which seems reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- The minimal security risk scores reflect the lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**5. Malware Score:**\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is justified given no malicious behavior is observed or implied.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions about the external `create_server` and `server.run` implementations.\n- They focus on the code provided, which is sound.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with benign configuration)  \n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, secure CLI wrapper for server startup. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities within this snippet. The external functions could potentially introduce risks, but based solely on this code, the security posture is very good.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, primarily due to reliance on external components, but no issues within this code)  \n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's straightforward nature.",
