  "purpose": "Setup configuration for installing the aiowhitebit-mcp package, which provides an MCP server and client for the WhiteBit cryptocurrency exchange API.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from variables, function parameters, and imported modules; no external input data is read dynamically during execution.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to package metadata, setup configuration, and package installation processes; no untrusted data is sent or stored.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the script only defines package configuration and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. The script is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools methods to define package metadata and dependencies. No external input handling, dynamic code execution, or network operations are present. The setup script appears typical for Python packages, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe and does not contain malware or suspicious anomalies.",
