  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data flow or output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script strictly handles package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present. All code is standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It does not include any dynamic code execution, network operations, or data processing that could pose security risks. The dependencies and entry points are typical for Python packaging. No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script for Python packaging with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
