{
  "purpose": "The script configures the setup for installing the aiowhitebit-mcp package, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies, package directories, and entry point definitions. No external input is read during execution.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the setup script does not execute untrusted code or handle external inputs dynamically.",
  "flows": "N/A - The script is static configuration code that does not involve data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The script uses placeholders like 'Your Name' and 'your.email@example.com' but these are typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup using setuptools, defining dependencies, metadata, and entry points. There are no dynamic or potentially malicious code execution, no network connections, or data leaks. All dependencies are fixed versions, and there is no code execution based on external input. The placeholders for author details suggest this is a template. No suspicious patterns or code indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical package setup script with no indications of supply chain attacks or malicious code.",
