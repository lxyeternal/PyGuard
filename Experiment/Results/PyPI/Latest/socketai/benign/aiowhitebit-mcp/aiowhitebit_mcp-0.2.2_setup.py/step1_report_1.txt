{
  "purpose": "The setup script configures the installation of the aiowhitebit-mcp package, which implements an MCP server and client for the WhiteBit cryptocurrency exchange API.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the setup() parameters, such as package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the script mainly defines package configuration for installation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the parameters (like install_requires, entry_points, extras_require) into the setup() function, which processes them for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The author name and email are placeholders, but that is typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools modules and defines dependencies and package metadata. It does not execute any code beyond configuration. No untrusted input sources or data manipulation are present. The script appears standard for a Python package setup without obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution. The use of placeholders suggests it is a template or example setup. Overall, it appears safe.",
