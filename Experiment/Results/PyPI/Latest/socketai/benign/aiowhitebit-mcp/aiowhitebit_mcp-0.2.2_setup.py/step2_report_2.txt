  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code in question is a standard Python setup script using setuptools.\n- It defines package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers.\n- There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input.\n- The code contains placeholders for author info, which is typical for template or example scripts.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Correctly describes the setup's function.\n- Data flow: From static parameters to setup().\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Score justifications:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, accurate.\n- Data flow: Static data, no external input.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard, safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Correct.\n- Data flow: Static, no external input.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Accurate.\n- Data flow: Static configuration.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Correct.\n- Data flow: Static strings, no external input.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical package setup, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious activity:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; the script is a standard setup configuration.\n\n### **Score justifications:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation patterns.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or higher would require signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities, which are absent here.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed; all reports correctly identify the script as benign.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe setup script is a standard, safe configuration file with no security concerns.",
