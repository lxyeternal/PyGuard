{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'aiowhitebit-mcp' with its dependencies and entry points for distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads input from package metadata fields, dependencies list, entry points, and setup configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable areas include the 'install_requires' dependencies, 'entry_points' for console scripts, and metadata fields if they contain untrusted input (which they do not here).",
  "flows": "No untrusted input flows are present; the setup process is static, relying on predefined strings and lists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It specifies dependencies, package directories, entry points, classifiers, and optional development requirements. All inputs are static strings; no user input, environment variables, or external data sources are read at runtime. No malicious or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows common Python packaging conventions with no anomalies or suspicious elements.",
