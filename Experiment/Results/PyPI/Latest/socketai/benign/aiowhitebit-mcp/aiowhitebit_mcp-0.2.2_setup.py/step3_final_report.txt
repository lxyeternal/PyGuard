  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the aiowhitebit-mcp library, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static strings and lists defining package info, dependencies, and entry points; no external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not process untrusted data or perform actions affecting system security.",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to setup() parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; placeholders are typical in template code, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup configuration using setuptools, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. Dependencies are fixed versions, and no secrets or malicious code are present. The placeholders are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. All signals point to benign, well-structured code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should remain at zero across all categories.",
