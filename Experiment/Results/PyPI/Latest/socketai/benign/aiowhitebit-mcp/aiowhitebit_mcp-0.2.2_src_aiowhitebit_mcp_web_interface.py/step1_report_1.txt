{
  "purpose": "Provides a web interface for monitoring and managing the WhiteBit MCP server, including health checks, metrics, circuit breakers, cache, and rate limiter controls.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files (HTML templates), server requests (HTTP GET/POST handlers), and internal data structures (metrics, caches, circuit breakers, rate limiter states).",
  "sinks": "Handles HTTP responses with HTML content, updates system states (resets, clears cache, circuit breakers), and interacts with monitoring and metrics components.",
  "flows": "User requests trigger handlers which read internal system states, then generate and return HTML content; some handlers modify system state (reset, clear cache).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. Use of open files is straightforward; no untrusted data execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical web server interface for system monitoring, with routes for health, metrics, cache, circuit breakers, rate limiter, and resets. It reads templates, system data, and responds with HTML. No external untrusted input handling beyond normal web request processing, and no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns detected. The functions perform standard monitoring and control operations. All data handling appears benign and designed for server management. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate monitoring and management interface with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected functions safely, without hardcoded secrets or suspicious data flows.",
