{
  "purpose": "Provides a web interface for viewing metrics, health checks, and managing caches and circuit breakers for the WhiteBit MCP server.",
  "sources": "Reads data from imported modules (caches, metrics, circuit breakers, monitoring, rate limiter), environment variables via os.path, and file system via open().",
  "sinks": "None apparent in the code; primarily renders HTML templates and interacts with internal server modules. No user input is processed directly in a way that could lead to code execution or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Fetches status data from internal modules and renders HTML templates with this data. No external data flow or untrusted input manipulation is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; straightforward route handling and template rendering. Template files are loaded from disk, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a web server with multiple endpoints to display system metrics, health, cache, and circuit breaker statuses, and to reset or clear cache and circuit breakers. No user input is processed in a manner that introduces security risks. No environment variables or secrets are hardcoded. The functions primarily call other modules to retrieve system status or perform actions, then render HTML responses. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or credential leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard web interface implementation for system monitoring and management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities in this module. It solely facilitates status viewing and control through internal APIs, with no evident attack vectors.",
