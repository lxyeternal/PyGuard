{
  "purpose": "Provide a web interface for monitoring and managing the WhiteBit MCP server, including metrics, health checks, caches, circuit breakers, and rate limiting.",
  "sources": "Loads HTML templates from files; reads monitoring server health, circuit breaker statuses, cache stats, and rate limiter status; extracts route parameters for cache and circuit breaker reset actions.",
  "sinks": "Generates HTML responses with embedded data; uses route parameters for cache and circuit breaker names; performs cache clearing and circuit breaker resets based on user actions.",
  "flows": "User requests trigger route handlers which retrieve system data and embed it into HTML content; reset routes use URL parameters to identify specific caches or circuit breakers for clearing or resetting.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; the code cleanly loads templates, handles HTTP requests, and invokes system management functions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured web interface for system monitoring and management. It loads templates from files, safely constructs responses with system data, and handles user actions through well-defined routes. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft, is evident. The route handlers interact with monitoring, cache, circuit breaker, and rate limiter modules, assuming these modules are secure and trusted. The parameters used for cache and circuit breaker operations are derived from route parameters, which are standard and do not indicate injection or malicious use. Overall, the implementation appears to be a straightforward administrative interface with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate monitoring and management web interface without malicious intent or security risks. It safely loads templates, retrieves system statuses, and provides user-initiated reset capabilities. No malware or malicious behaviors are present, and the code structure is clean and maintainable.",
