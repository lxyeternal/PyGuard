  "purpose": "Web interface for monitoring and managing the WhiteBit MCP server, including metrics, health checks, caches, circuit breakers, rate limiter, and templates.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML templates from files, internal module functions for system status, request parameters for resets and cache clearing.",
  "sinks": "Generates HTML responses, handles HTTP GET and POST requests, triggers resets and cache clear actions.",
  "flows": "Request handlers process incoming requests, invoke internal functions or read data, then render templates with system data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network connections; standard template loading and request handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward web management interface for system monitoring, with safe handling of internal data and parameters. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The use of route parameters and form actions is typical for such interfaces. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior, reflecting minimal security risk and no malware. The code's structure and data flows do not indicate any malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and well-structured management web interface with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
