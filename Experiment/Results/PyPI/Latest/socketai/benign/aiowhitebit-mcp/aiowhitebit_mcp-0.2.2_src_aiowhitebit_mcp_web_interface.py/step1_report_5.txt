{
  "purpose": "Provides a web interface for monitoring and managing the WhiteBit MCP server, including health checks, metrics, caches, circuit breakers, and rate limiting.",
  "sources": "File reading functions load HTML templates from the 'templates' directory; HTTP request handlers access request parameters (e.g., URL path variables).",
  "sinks": "Rendering HTML content with data from internal functions; redirects via HTTP 302 responses; form actions that trigger cache clearance or circuit breaker resets.",
  "flows": "User requests trigger handlers that read data (sources), process and format it into HTML templates, then respond with HTML content. Actions like cache clearing or circuit breaker resets invoke functions that modify internal state or redirect.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code only performs monitoring, control, and display functions, with no apparent attempts to exfiltrate data or execute malicious commands.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads HTML templates, sets up an aiohttp web server with multiple routes for monitoring and control functions, and correctly handles user requests. It uses internal functions to get data, formats responses safely, and performs standard web server operations. No hardcoded credentials or unsafe data handling is evident. There are no code injection points, dynamic code execution, or network communications to external suspicious domains. The code structure is clean, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The only external interactions are file reading for templates and internal function calls for server metrics and state changes, which are legitimate for this type of application.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured web interface for server monitoring and management, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected operations without any suspicious actions.",
