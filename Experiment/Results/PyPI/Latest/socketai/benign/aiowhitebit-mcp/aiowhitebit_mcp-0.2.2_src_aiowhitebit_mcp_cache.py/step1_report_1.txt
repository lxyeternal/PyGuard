{
  "purpose": "Provides a caching layer for the WhiteBit MCP server to improve performance and reduce API calls, including in-memory and optional disk persistence.",
  "sources": "User or external inputs may influence cache keys via key_fn; cache operations read/write to disk files; JSON serialization handles object data for persistence.",
  "sinks": "Disk file writes for persistence, JSON serialization output, cache get/set/delete operations that could leak data if misused.",
  "flows": "Inputs (e.g., cache keys, function arguments) are used to generate cache entries; cache reads retrieve stored data; cache writes serialize and store data; disk persistence saves cache state; on load, data is deserialized into cache entries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious string manipulations; extensive exception handling; usage of standard modules and functions; no network connections or data exfiltration; no backdoors or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical caching mechanism with optional disk persistence, custom serialization handling for complex objects, and a decorator for caching function results asynchronously. It properly manages cache validation based on TTL, handles cache corruption with file backup or removal, and provides utility functions for cache management. No suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious data flows are observed. The code operates within standard expectations for a cache component and does not contain malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a legitimate caching implementation without malicious behavior. It follows standard practices for serialization, cache management, and persistence, with appropriate error handling. No indicators of malware, sabotage, or security risks are present.",
