  "purpose": "Provide a caching layer for the WhiteBit MCP server to enhance performance and reduce API calls.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from cache get/set/delete methods; cache loading from disk; cache key generation in the cached decorator.",
  "sinks": "Cached data stored in memory or persisted to disk; potential for sensitive data leakage if such data is stored in cache.",
  "flows": "Input data -> cache get/set/delete functions -> data serialization/deserialization -> disk storage (if persistent) -> cache retrieval on subsequent calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code found. Use of custom JSON encoding is standard. Cache persistence and file handling include proper error handling. The decorator handles asynchronous functions correctly. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard caching mechanism with in-memory and optional disk persistence. It serializes objects for cache storage, handles cache validation based on TTL, and manages cache files with error handling for corrupted files. The cache key generation is straightforward, based on function names and arguments, which could theoretically lead to cache collisions but not malicious intent. The code uses proper Python idioms, and no network activity, data exfiltration, or reverse shells are present. All functions and methods operate within typical expectations for caching and disk storage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate caching utility for performance enhancement of the WhiteBit MCP server. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It performs standard data serialization, caching, and disk persistence with appropriate error handling. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose security risks related to supply chain or malware.",
