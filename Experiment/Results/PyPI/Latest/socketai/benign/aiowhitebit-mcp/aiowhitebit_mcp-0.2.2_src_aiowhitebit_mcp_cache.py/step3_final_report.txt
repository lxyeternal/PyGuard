{
  "purpose": "Provides a caching layer for the WhiteBit MCP server to improve performance and reduce API calls, with optional disk persistence and serialization of complex objects.",
  "sources": "Reads input data during cache set operations, cache key generation, and disk loading from cache files.",
  "sinks": "Stores cache entries in memory and optionally writes cache data to disk; reads cache data from disk during load.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function calls to cache get/set methods, with serialization/deserialization during disk persistence; cache retrievals check validity before returning data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard caching mechanism with in-memory storage and optional disk persistence. It serializes complex objects using a custom encoder, handles cache validation based on TTL, and manages disk I/O with error handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The serialization and persistence features are typical for cache implementations, and error handling is robust. No external network activity or suspicious data flows are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are justified given the code's benign nature and minimal risk of data leakage or misuse.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured caching utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
