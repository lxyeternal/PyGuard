  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured proxy layer designed for robustness and observability. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The fallback mock data, while potentially masking issues, is a common pattern and does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified."
