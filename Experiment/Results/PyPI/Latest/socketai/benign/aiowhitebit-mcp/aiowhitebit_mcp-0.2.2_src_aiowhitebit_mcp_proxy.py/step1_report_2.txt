  "purpose": "Proxy classes for WhiteBit API clients to add error handling, logging, caching, rate limiting, and circuit breaker functionalities for robustness and performance.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include API responses from the original client methods such as get_server_time, get_server_status, get_market_info, get_market_activity, get_orderbook, get_recent_trades, get_fee, get_asset_status_list, get_kline, get_single_market, get_tickers, get_symbols, and get_assets.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if untrusted data is improperly handled; however, in this code, data is mainly fetched and returned after minimal processing. No direct untrusted input sinks like system commands, file writes, or network exfiltration are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API responses (sources) through the proxy methods, which perform caching, error handling, and logging, then returns data or mock responses in case of errors. No external command or system effect is invoked by the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive try-except blocks that default to returning mock data if errors occur, which could obscure actual issues but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation are present. No data exfiltration or malicious code execution mechanisms are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of proxy classes wrapping existing API clients with added robustness features such as caching, rate limiting, circuit breakers, and logging. It uses decorators for these functionalities and gracefully handles exceptions by returning default or mock data. No malicious behaviors such as unauthorized data transmission, command execution, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation designed for stability and observability, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard proxy implementation for API clients, focused on stability, error handling, and performance. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It maintains the integrity of the data flow, with safe handling and minimal external interactions beyond API calls and internal processing.",
