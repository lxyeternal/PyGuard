{
  "purpose": "The code implements proxy classes for WhiteBit API clients, adding error handling, logging, caching, rate limiting, and circuit breakers to improve robustness, observability, and performance. In case of errors, fallback mock data is returned to prevent failures.",
  "sources": "API response data from the wrapped clients, input parameters for API calls, and exception handling blocks that trigger fallback responses.",
  "sinks": "Data returned to callers, fallback mock data, and logs; no external network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "API responses flow through proxy methods, which process and sometimes modify or replace data in exception cases; fallback mock data flows back to the caller.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fallback mock data in exception handling could mask underlying issues but is a common resilience pattern; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code wraps API clients with decorators for caching, rate limiting, and circuit breaking, adding error handling and logging. Exception cases return mock data, which enhances stability but could obscure real problems. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, transparent nature of the code. The fallback mechanisms are standard for resilience but should be monitored to ensure they do not hide critical issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured proxy layer designed for robustness and observability. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The fallback mock data, while potentially masking issues, is a common pattern and does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
