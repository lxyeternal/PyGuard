  "purpose": "Proxy classes for various Public API clients of WhiteBit, adding error handling, logging, caching, rate limiting, and circuit breaker mechanisms for robustness and performance.",
  "sources": "Input data from API responses and function parameters such as market, limit, start/end times, etc.",
  "sinks": "Return statements, exception handling, and data passed to models or returned directly to callers.",
  "flows": "API calls (sources) flow into proxy methods, which process responses, handle exceptions, and return data or mock responses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of extensive mock responses in exception handling, which could mask real issues but is not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements proxy wrappers around API clients, adding caching, rate limiting, circuit breakers, and logging to improve stability and performance. Error handling includes fallback responses with hardcoded mock data, which is typical for testing or resilience but could obscure actual API failures if misused. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious activities such as network data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or cryptomining are present. The logic focuses solely on safe API response handling and proxying. Overall, the code appears benign, with no malicious intent or security risk indicators beyond the use of fallback mocks, which are a standard practice for robustness rather than sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of proxy wrappers adding resilience and efficiency features around API clients. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident. The use of mock data in exception scenarios is a potential concern for masking real issues but does not constitute malicious activity. The overall security risk is low.",
