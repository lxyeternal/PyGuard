  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code implements proxy classes wrapping various WhiteBit API clients (V1, V2, V4).\n- These proxies add error handling, logging, caching, rate limiting, and circuit breakers.\n- In case of exceptions, they often return mock data or default values.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious code is evident.\n- The primary purpose appears to be robustness, observability, and performance.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues & Logical Consistency\n- The code appears to correctly implement proxy wrappers with decorators for resilience.\n- Exception handling defaults to mock data, which could mask real issues but is a common practice for resilience, not malicious intent.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the code's content.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The extensive use of fallback/mock data during exceptions could obscure underlying API failures, but this is a known pattern for robustness.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.\n- Use of decorators and error handling aligns with standard practices for API proxies.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware Score (0):** No malicious code, no data exfiltration, no network anomalies.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score (~0.1 - 0.2):** Slightly higher due to fallback mechanisms masking errors, but overall very low.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The reports are consistent with the code's content.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are reasonable.\n- The fallback to mock data, while potentially masking real issues, does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to fallback masking, but overall very low)\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, well-structured proxy layer aimed at improving API robustness and observability, with no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Final note:** The purpose of these proxies is to enhance stability and logging, not to conceal malicious activity. The low scores are justified.",
