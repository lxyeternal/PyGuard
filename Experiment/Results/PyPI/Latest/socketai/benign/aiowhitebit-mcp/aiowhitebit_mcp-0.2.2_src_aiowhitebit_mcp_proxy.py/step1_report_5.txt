{
  "purpose": "The code provides proxy classes for different WhiteBit API clients to add caching, rate limiting, error handling, and logging, facilitating safer interaction with the API.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from API calls via methods like get_server_time, get_server_status, get_market_info, get_market_activity, get_orderbook, get_recent_trades, get_fee, get_asset_status_list, get_kline, get_ticker, get_tickers, get_symbols, and get_assets.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include returning mock data or fallback defaults when exceptions occur, and passing data back to callers which may utilize or display this data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API responses (sources) through exception handling or decorators (circuit_breaker, cached, rate_limited) to the return statements, or to fallback mock data if errors occur. No data is sent externally outside the proxy functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; error handling includes fallback mock responses to prevent crashes. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code wraps API client methods with decorators for caching, rate limiting, and circuit breaking to enhance stability and performance. Error handling is implemented to return mock or default data on exceptions, minimizing risk of crashes or data leaks. The proxies do not contain suspicious network activities, backdoors, or malicious code. They primarily serve as wrappers that enhance reliability. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, unauthorized network connections, or code injection are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a safe, structured proxy layer for WhiteBit API clients, adding standard security and performance features. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms, focusing instead on robustness and maintainability.",
