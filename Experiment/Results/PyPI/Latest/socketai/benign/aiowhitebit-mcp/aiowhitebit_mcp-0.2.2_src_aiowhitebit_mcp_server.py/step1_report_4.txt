{
  "purpose": "Implement a WhiteBit MCP server exposing WhiteBit API functionalities as MCP tools for interaction and monitoring.",
  "sources": "Imports (e.g., aiowhitebit clients, fastmcp, pydantic), class constructor parameters, environment variables (not explicitly used), method parameters (e.g., web_host, web_port).",
  "sinks": "API method calls (e.g., get_ticker, get_server_time), WebSocket connect/disconnect, resource retrieval, monitoring functions, metrics collection, server run method, resource parameters.",
  "flows": "Input from MCP clients triggers API calls or resource access, which flow through registered tools and methods, potentially accessing or modifying data on the server or making external API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious URL or network activity, no data leaks or backdoors present in code. Use of standard libraries and well-documented API calls. WebSocket management is straightforward. Monitoring and health check implementations appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured MCP server for WhiteBit API interactions, with methods wrapping API calls and resource access. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. WebSocket connection management and monitoring are implemented securely and straightforwardly. No hardcoded secrets or insecure data handling are observed. The server uses standard practices for API interaction, resource management, and server lifecycle management. Overall, the code appears legitimate with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured implementation of a WhiteBit MCP server exposing API functionalities securely. No malicious or sabotage code detected. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data leaks identified. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
