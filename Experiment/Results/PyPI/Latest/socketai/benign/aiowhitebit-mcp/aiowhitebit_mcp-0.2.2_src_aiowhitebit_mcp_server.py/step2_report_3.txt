  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, score appropriateness, and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the Reports:**\n\n- All five reports conclude that the code is a standard, legitimate MCP server wrapping WhiteBit API functionalities.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code performs health checks, resource registration, WebSocket management, and metrics collection in a typical, secure manner.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), aligned with the benign assessment.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9–0.95), indicating strong agreement among reviewers.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- **Issues or vulnerabilities?** None are identified. The code appears clean, well-structured, and standard for an API proxy server.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or flaws?** No significant flaws are evident. The code handles resource cleanup, monitoring, and API interactions appropriately.\n- **Potential misconfigurations?** No, the code avoids hardcoded secrets and manages resources properly.\n- **Security concerns?** None detected, no backdoors or malicious code.\n\n### Score justification:\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score (0.1–0.2):** Justified as low, given the standard functionality and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- All reports correctly assume the code is benign. No assumptions about malicious intent are unsupported by the code content.\n\n### Consistency:\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis; all reports agree on the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed reviews, the code is a legitimate, well-implemented MCP server for WhiteBit exchange APIs, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.            |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1–0.2           | Very low; standard API wrapper with monitoring.             |\n\n**Overall:** The code is safe, legitimate, and functionally appropriate for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes to the scores are necessary; all reports are consistent and accurate.",
