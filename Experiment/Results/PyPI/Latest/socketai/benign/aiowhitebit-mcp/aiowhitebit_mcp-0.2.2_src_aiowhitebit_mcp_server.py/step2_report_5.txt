  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is described as implementing a server for WhiteBit exchange, exposing API functionalities via MCP tools, with data sources being API responses, WebSocket, and resource requests.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The logic is straightforward, wrapping API calls, setting up monitoring, and resource endpoints.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report concludes the code is legitimate, with high confidence (0.9), and malware/obfuscated scores at 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning appears sound. No malicious indicators are present. The code is standard for such a server.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, focusing on exposing WhiteBit APIs via MCP tools, with no suspicious data sinks.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The WebSocket is initialized on demand, which is normal.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a standard MCP server, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The server interacts with the exchange, exposing functionalities, with data flows from API responses, WebSocket, and resources.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code. All interactions are standard API calls.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a legitimate MCP server with no malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar overview, with focus on API calls, WebSocket, and resource endpoints.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries and practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a legitimate, secure MCP server for WhiteBit.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's structure; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard API proxy server with monitoring and resource registration.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The flow is typical for such servers.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears legitimate with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and thorough.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0, and no suspicious activity or code patterns are detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, mostly around 0.1-0.2, reflecting standard API proxy server risks without any malicious activity.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, typical for such API wrappers, no security issues identified.\n\n**Final Note:** The reports are consistent, and the code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured MCP server exposing WhiteBit exchange APIs with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
