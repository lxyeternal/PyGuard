{
  "purpose": "The code implements a WhiteBit MCP server that exposes WhiteBit API functionalities, WebSocket connections, resource endpoints, and monitoring tools, facilitating interaction with the exchange via MCP tools.",
  "sources": "API responses from aiowhitebit clients, WebSocket connection initiations, resource registration functions, health check endpoints, and metrics collection.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from API calls and WebSocket interactions; no untrusted input is processed in a way that leads to data leaks or malicious actions; no external untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Sources such as API responses and WebSocket data are processed within API wrapper functions, resource endpoints, and monitoring checks; these flows do not lead to data exfiltration or malicious activity, only standard data handling and monitoring.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard libraries and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical MCP server wrapping WhiteBit exchange APIs, with resource registration, WebSocket management, and monitoring. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, indicating clear code. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard API exposure without vulnerabilities. The code's purpose, data flows, and sinks are benign, and the implementation aligns with best practices for such a server.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured MCP server for WhiteBit exchange APIs, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is justified as 0. All reports are consistent and support this assessment.",
