{
  "purpose": "The code implements a server exposing WhiteBit exchange functionalities as MCP tools, facilitating API interactions, monitoring, and resource management.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include API client method calls, WebSocket connections, resource endpoints, and external APIs like get_server_time.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are method calls that send data over network connections, WebSocket communications, resource responses, or monitoring functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API client responses through wrapper functions, resource handlers, or WebSocket interactions back to MCP tools or network responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. All network interactions appear to be legitimate API calls; no obfuscated code, hidden functions, or misleading variable names are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an MCP server that interacts with the WhiteBit API, exposes functions as tools, manages WebSocket connections, and performs health checks and metrics collection. All functionalities rely on standard API client libraries and common Python practices. The server initializes API clients, proxies, and monitoring resources, and offers resource endpoints and WebSocket controls. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network behavior are evident. The use of external APIs, resource handling, and WebSocket connections appears consistent with intended exchange interaction. The code structure and comments indicate legitimate, intended functionality without obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a server interface for the WhiteBit exchange, with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It correctly utilizes API clients and MCP tools for intended purposes. Overall security risk is low, with no malicious intent detected.",
