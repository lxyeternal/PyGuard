  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward MCP server wrapping WhiteBit API clients, with no suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n   - The code structure, resource registration, API calls, WebSocket management, and monitoring are standard and legitimate.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, with no logical flaws or reasoning errors.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a typical API wrapper with monitoring, resource management, and WebSocket handling.\n   - No false positives or unwarranted concerns are present.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: between 0.1 and 0.2\n   - These seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores align with the findings.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All scores are well below 0.5, indicating low risk.\n   - The reports correctly interpret the code as legitimate, with no malicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign malware: 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports are cautious and based on code analysis, not assumptions.\n   - They recognize the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - The low security risk and malware scores reflect the code's legitimate purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** approximately 0.1–0.2 — low security risk, primarily due to the server exposing API endpoints, which is standard for such services.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a legitimate MCP server implementation wrapping WhiteBit API clients, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The security risk is minimal, and the code appears safe for deployment.\n\n**Recommended malware score:** 0  \n**Recommended obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Recommended security risk score:** 0.1–0.2\n\n**Note:** The low risk scores reflect the nature of the code as an API wrapper with monitoring, not a security threat.",
