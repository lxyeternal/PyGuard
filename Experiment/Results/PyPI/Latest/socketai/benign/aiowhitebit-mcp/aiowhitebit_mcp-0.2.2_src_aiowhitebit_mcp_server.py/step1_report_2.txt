{
  "purpose": "Provides an MCP server interface for interacting with WhiteBit exchange APIs, exposing functionality via MCP tools.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters, API client method calls, and WebSocket connection commands.",
  "sinks": "Exposes MCP tools that execute API calls; potential for data leaks if misused, but no direct sinks for untrusted data input are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from MCP clients trigger API calls through wrapped client methods; WebSocket connection commands influence WebSocket client state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. WebSocket is initialized on demand, which is normal. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. Logging is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes API clients, wraps their methods as MCP tools, and manages WebSocket connections, monitoring, and resource registration. It performs health checks and metrics collection securely. No suspicious data flows or hidden behaviors are present. The code adheres to standard patterns for service exposure, with proper resource cleanup. No indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a cryptocurrency exchange API MCP server.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured server interface exposing WhiteBit exchange APIs via MCP tools. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It functions as intended without suspicious activity.",
