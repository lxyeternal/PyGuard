  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence provided, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a straightforward MCP server wrapping WhiteBit API responses, WebSocket, and resource requests.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The code appears to be a standard API wrapper with monitoring.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's reasoning is sound; no malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The low security risk score aligns with the detailed analysis. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on API calls, WebSocket, and resource exposure.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation. The WebSocket is initialized on demand, which is normal.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent; no malicious indicators. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar exposure via API, WebSocket, resources, with health checks and metrics.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The code uses standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis supports the low malware and obfuscated scores. The security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** API interactions, WebSocket, resource registration.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** API proxy, resource registration, monitoring.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion aligns with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports confidently assign 0, citing no suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Consistently 0, supported by the clear, standard code structure.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal security concerns, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, well-structured, and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — low, consistent with a standard API wrapper and monitoring setup.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured MCP server for WhiteBit, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
