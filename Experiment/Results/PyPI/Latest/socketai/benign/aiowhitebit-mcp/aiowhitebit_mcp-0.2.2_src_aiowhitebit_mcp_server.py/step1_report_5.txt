{
  "purpose": "Implement a server exposing WhiteBit exchange API functionalities as MCP tools for integration and automation.",
  "sources": "API client initializations, web interface start, health check functions, and resource/resource registration methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted input are present; API calls and resource functions handle data from trusted API clients.",
  "flows": "Initialization of API clients -> Registration of tools and resources -> Handling incoming MCP tool calls -> Optional web interface and health checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code appears standard for an API proxy server. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a server class that initializes multiple API clients, wraps them as MCP tools, and sets up monitoring and web interfaces. It includes resource registration for market and asset data. No hardcoded secrets, command injections, or data leaks are evident. All interactions with external components are via standard API client methods. The health checks and metrics collection are typical for server health monitoring. No malicious behavior or sabotage indicators are detected. The overall structure and flow indicate a legitimate implementation of a service layer interfacing with a cryptocurrency exchange API.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API proxy server for WhiteBit exchange, providing MCP tools for market data and trading functionalities. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It functions as a legitimate API abstraction layer with monitoring features.",
