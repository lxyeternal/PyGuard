{
  "purpose": "The code implements a server for interacting with the WhiteBit cryptocurrency exchange via MCP tools, exposing various API functionalities and monitoring.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include API responses from WhiteBit clients, WebSocket connections, and resource requests via MCP resources.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data from API responses and WebSocket interactions are processed and returned; MCP tools may also accept parameters from clients, but mostly used internally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API calls (sources) through the methods that wrap these calls, returning results via MCP tools; WebSocket connection flows from connect/disconnect tools; resource endpoints access API data; monitoring tools perform health checks and metrics collection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be a straightforward MCP server implementation wrapping public API calls. No obfuscated code, cryptomining, or data exfiltration activities are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a server class that initializes MCP tools wrapping various API methods of the WhiteBit exchange, registers WebSocket and resource endpoints, and sets up monitoring and metrics. It uses asyncio for asynchronous operations and provides health checks. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present. All API interactions are standard and well-structured. There is proper cleanup and resource management. No indications of data leakage, code injection, or malicious data handling are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate, functional implementation for API exposure and monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard MCP server implementation exposing WhiteBit exchange functionalities with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is a typical API wrapper and monitoring setup with secure design considerations, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
