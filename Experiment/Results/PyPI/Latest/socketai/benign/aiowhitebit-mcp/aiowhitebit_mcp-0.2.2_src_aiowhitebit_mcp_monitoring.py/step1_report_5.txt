{
  "purpose": "The code provides monitoring and health check functionalities for the WhiteBit MCP server, exposing endpoints for health status, metrics, cache management, circuit breaker status, and rate limiter status.",
  "sources": "Data is read from registered check functions, metrics collectors, circuit breakers, cache objects, and the rate limiter. Inputs can include cache names and circuit breaker names via function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from health checks, metrics, cache status, and control functions. Potential issues could arise if untrusted input influences these outputs, but they are mainly for monitoring, not data processing.",
  "flows": "Input data (cache names, circuit breaker names) flows into functions like reset_circuit_breaker and clear_cache_by_name, which then invoke underlying functions. Results flow back as dictionaries, mainly for status reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors are evident. Use of standard monitoring libraries and clear structure. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Functions are straightforward with no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard monitoring module for a server, exposing health, metrics, cache, and circuit breaker states. It registers checks and provides control endpoints. All data inputs are for status reporting or control, with no indication of malicious data manipulation or external data exfiltration. No suspicious code flow, no data leaks, no use of untrusted inputs for malicious actions. No malware or harmful behaviors are evident. The code appears safe and purposefully designed for server health monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate monitoring implementation for server health and metrics. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided content. It operates as expected for a monitoring service, with no suspicious or harmful activity detected.",
