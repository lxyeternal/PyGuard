  "purpose": "Monitoring and health checks for the WhiteBit MCP server, exposing status, metrics, cache, circuit breaker, and rate limiter information via an MCP interface.",
  "sources": "External modules (`aiowhitebit_mcp.*`, `fastmcp`) for registering checks, metrics, caches, circuit breakers, and rate limiter status; functions like `register_check`, `get_all_circuit_breakers`, `get_rate_limiter`, `clear_cache`, `get_all_caches`.",
  "sinks": "Status endpoints for health, metrics, cache, circuit breakers, rate limiter; reset functions for metrics, cache, circuit breakers.",
  "flows": "External registration of check functions and control commands → stored in internal data structures → exposed via MCP tools → status and control responses.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward, with standard patterns for monitoring. Minor missing import or definition for `reset_circuit_breaker` in the second report, which could cause runtime errors but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical monitoring setup exposing health, metrics, cache, circuit breaker, and rate limiter statuses via an MCP server. It registers external functions for checks and controls, which is standard for plugin-like systems. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The only potential issue is the missing import or definition of `reset_circuit_breaker`, which is a functional bug rather than a security concern. The malware scores are consistently 0, and risk scores are low (~0.2), justified by the minimal exposure of internal system info and the controlled registration of external functions. The code's structure and purpose do not suggest malicious intent or supply chain risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard monitoring module with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate, with a minor bug to address regarding the missing `reset_circuit_breaker` definition. Overall, it poses minimal security concern.",
