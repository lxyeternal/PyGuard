{
  "purpose": "The code provides monitoring, health checks, and metrics collection for the WhiteBit MCP server, exposing endpoints via an MCP server interface.",
  "sources": "Input sources include registered health check functions, cache names, circuit breaker names, and optional parameters for reset operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include reset functions for circuit breakers and caches, and registration of health check functions; these could be manipulated if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (names, functions) flows into reset and registration functions; data flows from internal metrics and status functions to external callers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed. All external functions used appear standard for monitoring purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a monitoring server with health checks, metrics, and control endpoints. It registers monitoring tools using an external FastMCP framework. The registration functions accept input parameters like names and functions; however, these are intended for configuration and should be controlled by trusted code. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or unauthorized command execution. The use of external functions for cache, circuit breaker, and rate limiter management are typical in such a context. Overall, the code appears to be a standard monitoring implementation without malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard monitoring setup for the WhiteBit MCP server, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It relies on trusted external modules and allows for registration and querying of server health and metrics. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
