{
  "purpose": "The code provides monitoring and health check functionalities for the WhiteBit MCP server, exposing endpoints for health status, metrics, circuit breakers, cache status, and reset functions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are primarily function arguments, such as 'name' and 'check_func' for registering checks, and data from internal modules like caches, circuit breakers, and metrics collectors.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that reset caches, circuit breakers, or metrics, and functions that return status information. However, these do not directly process untrusted external input beyond function parameters.",
  "flows": "Data flows from registered check functions and API endpoint calls through functions like run_checks, get_metrics_collector, get_all_circuit_breakers, get_rate_limiter, and cache functions, ultimately returning status or resetting internal states.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard Python features and common monitoring libraries without obfuscated or dynamic code execution. No backdoors or malicious code segments are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for health checks and monitoring, registers various monitoring tools, and provides functions for status retrieval and resets. All data handling appears straightforward, with no external data processing that could introduce malicious behavior. The functions are designed to expose internal system states securely. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration present. Usage of imported modules appears standard for such monitoring purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical monitoring module for a server environment, implementing health checks and status endpoints without any malicious or suspicious features. It appears secure and intended solely for operational monitoring. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
