{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a circuit breaker pattern for handling API outages and preventing cascading failures in a system, specifically for the WhiteBit MCP server.",
  "sources": "Input data includes function parameters, environment, and internal state variables such as 'name', 'failure_threshold', 'recovery_timeout', 'timeout', and internal timestamps like 'last_failure_time' and 'last_success_time'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are exceptions raised on circuit open or timeout, logging functions, and state modifications which could impact system behavior. No direct data leaks or unsafe operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (e.g., function arguments, exceptions) flows through decision points in 'allow_request', 'record_failure', and 'record_success'. These influence whether requests are permitted or the circuit's state transitions, with time-based checks controlling state changes in 'allow_request'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code, are present. The code properly implements a standard circuit breaker pattern with clear state management. No hidden or malicious logic is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard circuit breaker pattern with asynchronous request handling, timeout management, and state transitions based on failure thresholds and timeouts. It uses logging for state changes and errors. No malicious behavior or suspicious activity is evident. All operations appear to be aligned with typical circuit breaker functionality, and no external or secret data access is performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a circuit breaker pattern without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It manages API request flow control to enhance system resilience. No security risks or malicious behaviors are identified based on the provided code.",
