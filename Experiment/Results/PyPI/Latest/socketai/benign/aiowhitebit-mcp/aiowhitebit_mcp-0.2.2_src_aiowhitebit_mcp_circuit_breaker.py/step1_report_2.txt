{
  "purpose": "Implement a circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures and handle API outages in the WhiteBit MCP server.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily from function parameters, class attributes, and system time functions (time.time()).",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the code could raise exceptions that might be caught elsewhere; however, no explicit data leaks, network operations, or external system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Function calls and method executions follow logical flow from circuit state checks to request handling and failure/success recording. The main flow is: check if request allowed, execute request with timeout, record success or failure based on outcome.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code strictly implements circuit breaker logic without malicious activities or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a circuit breaker pattern with proper state management, including open, half-open, and closed states. It uses asyncio for asynchronous request handling with timeout controls. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors. Exception handling is limited to logging and raising errors, typical for such patterns. The global registry of circuit breakers is straightforward. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code were found. The code appears to be a standard, security-conscious implementation of a circuit breaker pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a circuit breaker pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs its intended function without exposing vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
