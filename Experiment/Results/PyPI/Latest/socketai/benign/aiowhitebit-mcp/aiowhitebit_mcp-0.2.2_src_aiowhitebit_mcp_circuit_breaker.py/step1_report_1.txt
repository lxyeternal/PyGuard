{
  "purpose": "Implement a circuit breaker pattern to handle API outages and prevent cascading failures in the WhiteBit MCP server.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters, class methods for recording successes and failures, and the decorator wrapping functions for making requests.",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions when the circuit is open or request times out; logging warnings and errors.",
  "flows": "Input data (requests) pass through 'allow_request' to determine if the request proceeds; upon success or failure, recording methods update internal state; the decorator manages execution flow based on circuit state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are present. The code uses standard patterns for circuit breakers. No obfuscated code or unusual language features identified.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard circuit breaker pattern with clear state management, timeouts, and failure thresholds. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or unauthorized data collection are evident. It utilizes asyncio for asynchronous request handling and logging for state changes, which is typical for such patterns. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or sabotage are detected. The overall design appears to be a straightforward implementation of a resilient API client pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a circuit breaker for managing API failures with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard practices and does not exhibit obfuscated or harmful behavior.",
