{
  "purpose": "Implements a circuit breaker pattern to manage API outages and prevent cascading failures in an asynchronous environment.",
  "sources": "Reads input data via function calls, exception handling, and asyncio.wait_for for request timeouts.",
  "sinks": "Raises exceptions on open circuit or timeout; logs state changes and errors.",
  "flows": "Source: Function invocation or external request -> CircuitBreaker.allow_request() check -> Potential exception raise or request execution -> record_success() or record_failure() based on outcome.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard pattern; global mutable state for circuit registry.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an asynchronous circuit breaker. It manages states (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN) correctly, uses asyncio for timeouts, and logs state transitions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious network activity, or data leaks are present. Exception handling is generic but appropriate; could be refined for specificity. The global registry is typical but could be made thread-safe if needed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a circuit breaker pattern with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk and malware scores are justified as zero, and the low risk score reflects operational safety. No modifications are necessary; the assessments are accurate.",
