{
  "purpose": "Provides a rate limiting mechanism for the WhiteBit MCP server API to prevent exceeding quotas.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters (endpoint names) and internal time.time() calls for request timestamps.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write untrusted data to external systems; it manages internal request counts and timing.",
  "flows": "Source: function parameters and internal time; Sink: internal rate limit checks and sleep calls in the decorator.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code appears to implement a standard rate limiting pattern. No suspicious external network activity, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a rate limiter with configurable rules, tracking request timestamps to enforce limits. It provides mechanisms to add rules, check if requests are allowed, and delay execution when limits are reached via async sleep. The use of logging, dataclasses, and decorators appears legitimate and focused solely on API rate management. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The structure and logic are straightforward and align with standard rate limiting implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured rate limiter implementation for API quota enforcement. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or malicious code injection. The code's purpose is solely to manage request rates, with no evidence of malware or sabotage.",
