  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the details, consistency, and the scores assigned, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Implements a rate limiter to prevent API quota breaches. Uses standard request timestamp tracking and rules per endpoint/group.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Decorators enforce delays via asyncio.sleep, which is typical for rate limiting.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, straightforward logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-structured, legitimate, no malicious behavior, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The logic is standard, no malicious intent, and the scoring reflects that. The low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with standard timestamp-based rate limiting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses can_request(), add_request(), asyncio.sleep(), all normal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, safe, straightforward implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the previous report; no malicious elements. Slightly higher risk score (0.2) is reasonable considering the use of asyncio.sleep() which could delay requests but is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, with standard timestamp tracking.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Enforces rate limits via waiting and request counting.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external data leaks.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, safe, standard design.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with prior reports; no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Implements a typical rate limiter with configuration for WhiteBit quotas.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses asyncio.sleep() for rate enforcement, no external data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, safe, with a high confidence (1).\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with expected behavior; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same purpose, standard timestamp and request count management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses asyncio.sleep() for rate limiting.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, safe, with high confidence (~0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with other reports, no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or covert channels.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is accurate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the potential for delays or misuse of asyncio.sleep(), but overall minimal security risk.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected in any report.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent, uses standard patterns.  \n**Risk:** ~0.15 — small delays or potential misuse, but no real security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code's nature. The implementation is a standard, safe rate limiter with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
