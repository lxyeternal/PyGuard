{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'rpi-metrics-server' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining package dependencies and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct use of untrusted data or sensitive information handling.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; setup process mainly involves static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads the README.md file for long description, which is typical. The dependencies specified are 'flask' and 'flask-limiter', both common web framework packages. The entry point 'rpi-metrics-server' points to a function in a module but does not execute any code directly. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling beyond static file reading, and no suspicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and follows common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscation, and there are no security concerns arising from its content.",
