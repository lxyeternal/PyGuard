{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'rpi-metrics-server' package, which is intended to monitor Raspberry Pi system metrics via a Flask server.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; reading package metadata; no external data input or user input handling.",
  "sinks": "Installation dependencies specified; no sinks for untrusted data or network activity directly shown in this script.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are evident; the code primarily defines package metadata and setup instructions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of 'open' to read README.md is standard; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script for a Python package, importing 'setuptools' to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies the package name, version, author info, description, URL, classifiers, required Python version, dependencies, package data inclusion, and entry points for console scripts. There are no sources of untrusted input or suspicious code patterns. Dependencies are standard for Flask-based projects. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks is present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package without any malicious intent or security concerns. It simply defines how to install and configure the 'rpi-metrics-server' package. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
