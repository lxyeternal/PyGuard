{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration for 'rpi-metrics-server', defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata; dependencies 'flask' and 'flask-limiter'; entry point to 'main' function in external module.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main' function at entry point, which likely starts a server; no untrusted data handling or network activity within this script.",
  "flows": "Static configuration data used during package installation; no dynamic data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard setup script with no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and console entry points. It reads a static README file, specifies dependencies, and sets an entry point for a server application. No code execution, dynamic behaviors, or embedded secrets are present. The script follows best practices and contains no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this static, benign configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. It simply configures the package for distribution and execution of a server application. The security risk is negligible, and no suspicious behaviors are detected.",
