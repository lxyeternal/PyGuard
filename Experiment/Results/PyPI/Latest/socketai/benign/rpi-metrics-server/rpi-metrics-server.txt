      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate system management API for Raspberry Pi, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security concern is operational: if API keys are leaked or default, critical system commands could be executed maliciously. Proper security measures, such as replacing default API keys and adding access controls, are recommended. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero; the overall security risk is moderate (~0.4) due to the potential impact of command execution if compromised."
