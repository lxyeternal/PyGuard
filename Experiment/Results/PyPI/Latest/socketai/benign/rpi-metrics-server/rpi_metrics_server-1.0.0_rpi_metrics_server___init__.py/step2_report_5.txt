  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports indicate that the provided snippet is merely a comment or header with no actual implementation code.\n   - There are no sources, sinks, flows, or executable logic present.\n   - Therefore, no security issues, malicious behaviors, or vulnerabilities can be identified from the snippet itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent in noting the absence of code and thus cannot identify specific issues.\n   - They correctly refrain from making unwarranted security claims based solely on a comment header.\n   - No logical flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign very low confidence (0.2 to 0.9, mostly around 0.2) and minimal security risk (0 to 0.2), which aligns with the lack of code.\n   - Malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given no suspicious activity is observed.\n   - Obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the absence of code.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores:**\n   - Since no code is present, there is no basis for assigning higher malware or risk scores.\n   - The reports correctly avoid overestimating threat levels.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the lack of implementation details.\n   - They correctly state that no malicious activity can be inferred from the snippet.\n\n6. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the minimal information provided.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the current data.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to lack of information)\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- If the full package contains actual implementation code, a security review should be conducted on that code.\n- The current snippet alone does not warrant concern.\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the provided snippet and reports, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
