  "purpose": "This code appears to be a placeholder or header comment indicating a Raspberry Pi metrics server package, with no actual implementation provided.",
  "sources": "No sources; only a comment header present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output functions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows; absence of executable code prevents any source-to-sink analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; only a header comment with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet contains only a comment header describing a Raspberry Pi metrics server package. There are no functions, data flows, network activity, or executable logic present. Given the minimal content, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1) are appropriate but could be further lowered to zero due to the absence of code. The high confidence in some reports is based on the detailed description, but without actual implementation, the risk remains negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a non-functional placeholder with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments correctly identify the lack of executable code and suspicious activity. The overall security posture is benign, and no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.",
