{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a package for collecting and serving metrics from a Raspberry Pi device.",
  "sources": "Reads system data such as CPU, memory, and temperature metrics, likely from system files or APIs.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs data to network endpoints or logs, but specific sinks are not detailed in the snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Collects system metrics (sources), processes or formats them, then outputs or transmits the data (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or unusual code behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, focusing on system metric collection. It does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or execute external commands. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The structure appears standard for a monitoring package. The review is limited to the provided snippet, which shows no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The package seems to serve a legitimate purpose related to Raspberry Pi system monitoring. No malware or obfuscation detected. Overall security risk is low.",
