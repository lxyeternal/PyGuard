  "purpose": "The code appears to be a package related to collecting or serving metrics on Raspberry Pi devices.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown in the provided snippet, but typically include system commands, environment variables, or external data files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network communication functions, file writing operations, or subprocess calls, but none are explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Without detailed code, it is unclear how data flows from sources to sinks. The snippet does not provide enough information about data handling or processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code provided contains only a comment or a header with no actual implementation, making it impossible to identify unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is limited to a comment indicating the package's purpose related to RPi metrics. No actual code, functions, or logic are present to analyze for security issues, data flow, or malicious intent. Without further code, there are no observable sources, sinks, or flows. The lack of implementation details prevents identifying any anomalies or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this minimal snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The package appears to be a simple or placeholder header with no suspicious code. However, without additional code or context, a thorough security assessment cannot be performed.",
