  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable, indicating the package version.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data outputs or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no input/output, no data processing, and no control flow. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and standard nature make it benign. All signals point to a non-malicious, safe component with no vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores should all be 0. The confidence in this assessment is high.",
