  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports describe the code as simply assigning a string to `__version__`. This is a standard practice in Python packages.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or complex logic involved.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or signs of obfuscation are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is harmless and typical for version declaration.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are reasonable given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk, there's no justification for higher scores.\n   - The code is a straightforward version string assignment, common in open source projects.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as a simple version declaration.\n   - No overinterpretation of the code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The high confidence score (1) is justified given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is entirely benign, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nGiven the minimal, straightforward nature of the code, I agree with the reports' assessments. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present. The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, harmless version string declaration with no security implications.",
