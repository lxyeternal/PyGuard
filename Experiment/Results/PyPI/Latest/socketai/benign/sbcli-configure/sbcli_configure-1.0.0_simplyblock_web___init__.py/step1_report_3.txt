  "flows": "No data flow exists since the code does not process or handle any data or inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no operational statements, imports, or logic; it is an empty script. There are no unusual code patterns, secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is either missing or intentionally left blank. Without any functional code, input handling, or data processing, there are no apparent security issues or malicious behaviors. The absence of code also means there is no malicious intent or malicious code embedded. Given the lack of content, it is impossible to identify any anomalies or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is empty or non-functional, with no evidence of malicious activity or security concerns. It likely serves as a placeholder or was improperly extracted.",
