{
  "purpose": "To serve as an entry point for a CLI application that uses the 'simplyblock_cli' library to perform blockchain-related operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the execution trigger (main entry point) and imports a CLI wrapper class from an external library.",
  "sinks": "The code initializes and runs a CLI wrapper; no direct sinks such as network or file I/O are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "The main flow is: start script -> import CLIWrapper -> instantiate CLIWrapper -> run CLIWrapper's 'run' method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for CLI entry points.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging modules and configures a basic logging setup, then imports a CLI wrapper class from 'simplyblock_cli.cli'. It defines a main block where an instance of CLIWrapper is created and executed. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The script appears to be a standard CLI launcher for a blockchain-related tool. No external network calls, data handling, or potentially harmful code is evident within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI launcher with no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security issues detected. It relies on an external library to perform its main function, and there are no signs of malware or security risks within this snippet.",
