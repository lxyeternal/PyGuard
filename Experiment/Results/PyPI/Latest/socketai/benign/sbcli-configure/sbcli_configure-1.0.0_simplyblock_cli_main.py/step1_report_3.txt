  "purpose": "This script serves as an entry point for a command-line interface (CLI) application, initializing logging and executing the CLI.",
  "sources": "import statements (simplyblock_cli.cli), logging setup, execution of cli.run()",
  "sinks": "cli.run() method execution, but without the implementation details, no direct untrusted data sink is evident",
  "flows": "logging setup -> instantiation of CLIWrapper -> execution of cli.run()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging with a specific format, imports a CLI wrapper class, and runs the CLI. The structure is straightforward, and no suspicious code patterns, malicious code, or anomalies are present. The actual behavior depends on the implementation of CLIWrapper and its run() method, which are not provided, so potential malicious activity cannot be fully assessed. Based solely on this snippet, there are no signs of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple CLI launcher with logging setup, and there are no evident malicious behaviors or security risks in this fragment. The overall security posture depends on the CLIWrapper implementation, which is not provided.",
