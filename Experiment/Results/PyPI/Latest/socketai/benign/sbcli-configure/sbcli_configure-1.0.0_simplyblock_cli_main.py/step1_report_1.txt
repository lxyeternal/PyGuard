{
  "purpose": "The script initializes logging and runs a CLI wrapper for a command-line interface application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input via the CLIWrapper's run() method.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks could be within CLIWrapper.run(), which may process or output data, but this is unknown from the code provided.",
  "flows": "Input data (possibly user commands) flow into CLIWrapper.run(), which may process and produce output or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with standard logging setup; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging with timestamped messages, then creates and runs a CLIWrapper instance. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors visible in this minimal code snippet. The imported CLIWrapper's implementation is unknown; therefore, potential malicious behavior could reside there, but based solely on this code, no malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a benign entry point for a CLI application with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code. Its security profile depends on the implementation of CLIWrapper, which is not available here.",
