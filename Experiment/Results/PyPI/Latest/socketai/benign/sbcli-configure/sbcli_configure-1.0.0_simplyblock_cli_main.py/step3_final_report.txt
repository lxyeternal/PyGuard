{
  "purpose": "Minimal CLI launcher that sets up logging and invokes an external CLIWrapper class's run method.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports modules and instantiates CLIWrapper.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of logging -> creation of CLIWrapper instance -> execution of cli.run()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple script that configures logging and runs a CLI wrapper. The implementation of CLIWrapper is unknown, which could contain malicious behavior, but the snippet itself shows no signs of malicious activity. No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of this minimal code. The main concern remains the external CLIWrapper's trustworthiness, but this cannot be assessed here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and straightforward, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The low security risk scores are justified, assuming the external CLIWrapper is trustworthy. Overall, the code snippet itself poses minimal security concern.",
