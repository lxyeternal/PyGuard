  "purpose": "The script initializes logging and runs a command-line interface (CLI) wrapper for the simplyblock_cli package.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration for logging; instantiating CLIWrapper object; calling cli.run()",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of cli.run(), which may execute code within the CLIWrapper class",
  "flows": "Logging setup -> CLIWrapper instantiation -> cli.run() execution",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of standard logging and CLI wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up logging with a stream handler and a formatter, then creates an instance of CLIWrapper from an external module and executes its run method. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data leaks within this fragment. The code appears to be a straightforward entry point for a CLI application, relying on the imported package. Without insight into the implementation of CLIWrapper, no malicious intent can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple CLI launcher with standard logging. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent in this snippet.",
