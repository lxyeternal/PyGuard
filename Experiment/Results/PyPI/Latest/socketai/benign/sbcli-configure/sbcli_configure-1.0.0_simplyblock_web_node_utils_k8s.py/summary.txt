  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Kubernetes network management utility that executes iptables commands inside pods. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the potential for command injection if inputs are compromised, but no active malicious activity is evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score should be around 0.2 to 0.3, considering the potential for misuse under compromised environments."
