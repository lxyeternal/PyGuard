  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured CLI wrapper for storage management, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). Proper security depends on secure implementation of the called functions, but the dispatch logic itself is safe and standard."
