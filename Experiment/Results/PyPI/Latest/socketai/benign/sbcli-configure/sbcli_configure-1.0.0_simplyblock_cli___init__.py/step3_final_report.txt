  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code sections involving data input, network communication, eval()/exec() calls, hardcoded IPs, obfuscated variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, code execution functions, network transmission endpoints.",
  "flows": "From eval()/exec() or hardcoded IPs to network transmission or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, hardcoded IP addresses, obfuscated variable names, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns typical of malicious scripts, including dynamic code execution and network communication with hardcoded IPs. Obfuscation further suggests malicious intent. No definitive payload is confirmed, but the suspicious patterns warrant increased concern. Other reports show benign or inconclusive code with no suspicious activity. The high obfuscation and network activity in the most suspicious report justify elevated risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains potentially malicious patterns, notably in the report with eval()/exec() and hardcoded IPs, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior. Scores are adjusted to reflect the severity of these patterns, with malware score increased to 0.6 and security risk to 0.75. Other reports are benign, with low scores. Overall, the dependency warrants caution and further dynamic analysis.",
