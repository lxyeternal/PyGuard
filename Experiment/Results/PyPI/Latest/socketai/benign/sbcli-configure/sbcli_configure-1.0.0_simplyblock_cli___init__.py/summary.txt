  "conclusion": "The dependency contains potentially malicious patterns, notably in the report with eval()/exec() and hardcoded IPs, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior. Scores are adjusted to reflect the severity of these patterns, with malware score increased to 0.6 and security risk to 0.75. Other reports are benign, with low scores. Overall, the dependency warrants caution and further dynamic analysis."
