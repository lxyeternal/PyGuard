{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs some basic operations, possibly related to data processing or utility functions. No clear malicious intent is evident from the visible functions and logic.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'input_data' variable, environment variables, or function parameters; potential file or network input not explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via print statements or returns; no evidence of data being sent over the network, written to system files, or other sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (variables, parameters) through processing functions, ultimately leading to output or return statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward data handling without complex control flows. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It lacks network activity, file tampering, or credential misuse. The code structure and syntax are clear and conventional, indicating normal functionality.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors identified. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
