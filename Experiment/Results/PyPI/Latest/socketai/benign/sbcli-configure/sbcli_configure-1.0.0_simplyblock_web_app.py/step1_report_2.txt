  "purpose": "This code initializes and configures a Flask web application with multiple API blueprints and middleware, providing a web server with specific routes and security configurations.",
  "sources": "Import statements (importing utils, blueprints, auth middleware, constants); app configuration and route registration",
  "sinks": "App route functions, middleware decorators, app.run() invocation",
  "flows": "Imports and initializations lead to Flask app setup; blueprints and middleware register and manage routes; main execution starts app.run()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL patterns, or malicious code; use of token_required middleware suggests authentication handling; no obfuscated code or unusual language features",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and application-specific modules for configuration, logging, and API routes. It sets up a Flask app, registers multiple blueprints for modular API endpoints, and applies an authentication middleware 'token_required' for incoming requests. The main block runs the app with host '0.0.0.0' and debug mode controlled by constants. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, network data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The structure and imports are typical for a secure web API service; no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Flask application setup with proper modular route registration and authentication middleware. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware is present. The code is well-structured and uses common practices without obfuscation or malicious indicators.",
