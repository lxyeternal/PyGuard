{
  "purpose": "Set up a Flask web application with multiple route blueprints, authentication middleware, and error logging.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (utils, blueprints, auth_middleware, core_utils), environment variables (constants), and request handlers.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly shown; framework functions like app.run() handle network interactions, but no untrusted data handling or external connections are directly coded.",
  "flows": "HTTP requests pass through Flask's routing and middleware, invoking registered blueprints and middleware functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code uses standard Flask patterns and initializes Sentry SDK via core_utils.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules and initializes a Flask app, registers multiple API blueprints, and applies middleware for token verification. Logging is configured, and the app is set to run on all interfaces. No user input processing, data leakage, or network communication with untrusted sources is evident. The code appears to be a standard web app setup with no malicious or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard, benign Flask application setup with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It primarily configures routes and middleware for a web service without any suspicious or harmful code.",
