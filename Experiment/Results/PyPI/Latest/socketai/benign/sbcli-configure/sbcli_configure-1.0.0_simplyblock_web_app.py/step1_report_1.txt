{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and configures a Flask web application with multiple API blueprints, authentication middleware, and monitoring setup.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration values from imported modules (utils, constants), and reads incoming HTTP requests at the Flask route and before_request hook.",
  "sinks": "Returns responses via utils.get_response, registers blueprints, and starts Flask app with app.run.",
  "flows": "Incoming requests hit the Flask routes or before_request, authenticated via token_required, then handled by respective blueprints or status route; responses are generated and sent back.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, secret keys, or unusual code. The code relies on external modules for critical functions, which are assumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Flask application setup. It imports several blueprints and middleware, sets up logging and error monitoring, and runs the server. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activity embedded in this code snippet. All functions, modules, and routes appear legitimate and intended for typical API service deployment. External modules might contain risks, but based solely on this code, there is no malicious logic or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Flask application setup with multiple API blueprints and monitoring. It does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious behavior within this snippet. No security risks or malicious activities are detected from the provided code.",
