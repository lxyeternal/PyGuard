  "purpose": "This code initializes and configures a Flask web application with multiple blueprints and middleware for handling API routes and security tokens.",
  "sources": "Imports of modules such as utils, blueprints, auth_middleware, and constants; reading configuration from constants; reading request data via Flask's request context.",
  "sinks": "HTTP route responses, logger configurations, and Sentry SDK initialization.",
  "flows": "Initialization of app and configuration flows from imported modules; request handling via before_request decorator; route handling returning a JSON response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of standard Flask app setup and registration of blueprints is typical. No obfuscated or unusual language features. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Flask app with multiple API blueprints, integrates security middleware, and initializes error tracking via Sentry. It uses standard practices for API route registration and request handling. The only potentially sensitive operation is the initialization of Sentry SDK, but that is typical for error tracking and not malicious. No user input processing or data flows that could lead to injections or leaks are visible. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard web application bootstrap without any malicious intent or security issues. It relies on imported modules for core logic, which are not analyzed here. Based on this code alone, there is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior.",
