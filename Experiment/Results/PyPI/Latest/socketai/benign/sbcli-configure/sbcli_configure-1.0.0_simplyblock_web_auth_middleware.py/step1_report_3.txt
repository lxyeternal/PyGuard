{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Flask decorator for token-based authentication, validating cluster credentials via headers and a database lookup.",
  "sources": "Reads 'Authorization' header from incoming requests, decodes Base64 token, and queries database for cluster info.",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposes cluster IDs and secrets if logs or error messages leak data; database query results are used for credential verification.",
  "flows": "Extracts Authorization header -> decodes token -> retrieves cluster info from database -> compares secrets for authentication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; standard token handling. Uses exception handling for decoding and database errors. Prints exceptions, which may leak info in logs.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly processes authorization headers, decodes Base64 tokens, and compares credentials against database entries. No suspicious logic or backdoors are present. It handles errors gracefully, with some risk of exception message leakage. No malicious behaviors like data exfiltration or hidden network activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard authentication decorator with proper credential validation. No malicious or sabotage behavior is detected. It performs typical security checks and handles errors without evident malicious intent.",
