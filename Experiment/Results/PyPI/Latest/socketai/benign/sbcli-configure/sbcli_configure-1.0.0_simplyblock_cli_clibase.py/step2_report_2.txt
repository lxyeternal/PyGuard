  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a CLI dispatcher for storage and cluster management, primarily passing user inputs to external modules like `storage_ops`, `cluster_ops`, etc.\n- **Key points:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, minimal validation (CPU mask regex), high reliance on external modules.\n- **Security implications:** The code itself is not malicious; the main concern is whether the external modules properly validate inputs. The CPU mask validation is minimal but present.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, mainly due to lack of input validation in some areas)\n\n**Assessment:** The report is reasonable. The code appears as a typical CLI wrapper with no evident malicious intent. The malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, describing the CLI as a management interface delegating to external modules.\n- **Key points:** No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code, straightforward delegation.\n- **Security implications:** No signs of malicious activity; relies on external modules' security.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the previous report. The code is standard for management CLI tools, with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** CLI for managing storage cluster, with user input parsed and passed to system functions.\n- **Key points:** Uses `input()` for prompts, validation for CPU masks, no suspicious code.\n- **Security implications:** No signs of malicious activity; input validation is minimal but standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a management wrapper with low security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others—CLI for storage management, with delegation to external modules.\n- **Key points:** No secrets, no obfuscated code, standard validation.\n- **Security implications:** No malicious patterns; the code is a typical management CLI.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's structure and behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** CLI wrapper for managing storage clusters, with delegation and input validation.\n- **Key points:** No signs of malicious activity, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- **Security implications:** Very low risk, primarily dependent on external modules' security.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; the code is a standard management interface.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports indicate 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero, reflecting minimal validation and reliance on external modules, but overall very low.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical CLI dispatcher that delegates to external modules responsible for actual system operations.\n- No embedded malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation is present.\n- The main security concern is the validation of user inputs before passing to these modules, which is minimal but standard.\n- The malware score remains at **0**, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (low, mainly due to minimal validation and external dependencies)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe and legitimate as a CLI wrapper for system management. The overall security posture is low risk, with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
