  "conclusion": "This code is a standard management CLI dispatcher with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. Its security posture depends on the external modules' validation routines. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the risk score at approximately 0.2, which is justified given the minimal validation and delegation pattern."
