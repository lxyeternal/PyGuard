{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'cryptograohy', including a custom post-installation command that imports and initializes a module.",
  "sources": "Input data from package metadata, dependencies, and the post-install method fetching build eggs and importing 'pyprettifier'.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported modules and the custom post-install code that could execute additional actions during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom command fetches build eggs and executes '_post_install_action', which imports 'pyprettifier' and creates an 'EmojiConverter' instance.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes a custom install class that executes code during installation, specifically importing 'pyprettifier' and creating an object, which is not typical. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code directly observed. Package name misspelled as 'cryptograohy', which may suggest obfuscation or typo but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup process with a custom post-install command that fetches build dependencies and runs a method to import and instantiate a class from 'pyprettifier'. The import and instantiation happen during installation, which is atypical but not inherently malicious. No external network connections, data leaks, or malicious activities are explicitly present. The code appears to be intended to run some initialization or setup tasks during package installation. The presence of a custom install class and dynamic import could be suspicious if used maliciously but, in this case, seems more like an unusual setup procedure. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform a standard setup with an unusual but not malicious custom post-install step. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system damage. The primary concern is the unconventional use of code during installation, which warrants review but does not suggest malicious activity.",
