  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing core functions and executing the CLI command.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .core and .cly modules, execution of cli() function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of cli() which likely runs command-line interface logic.",
  "flows": "Import modules → execute cli() → user interaction or further code within cli()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'greet' from a local core module and 'cli' from a local module 'cly'. Immediately calls 'cli()' upon import, which suggests that the package is designed to run its CLI interface as soon as imported or initialized. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The direct invocation of cli() could be considered normal for CLI tools, but it also means that simply importing this module would trigger command-line interactions, which might be unexpected in some contexts. There are no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script that runs a CLI command upon import. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The immediate execution of 'cli()' might be unusual but is typical for CLI tools; no malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
