  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing greeting and CLI functions, then executing the CLI.",
  "sources": "Imports from .core and .cly modules, specifically 'greet' and 'cli'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'cli()' which may process user input or command-line arguments.",
  "flows": "Import statements followed by immediate call to 'cli()' upon module import.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate invocation of 'cli()' during import, which is unconventional and can cause side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'greet' and 'cli' from local modules and executes 'cli()' immediately. This pattern can lead to unintended CLI prompts or commands when the module is imported, potentially causing security or usability issues. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The main concern is the design choice rather than malicious intent. Scores are appropriately low: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.3, reflecting the potential side effects but no inherent malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not contain malicious content. The primary issue is the immediate execution of 'cli()' at import time, which could be problematic in certain contexts. No evidence suggests malicious activity, and the scores are consistent with this assessment.",
