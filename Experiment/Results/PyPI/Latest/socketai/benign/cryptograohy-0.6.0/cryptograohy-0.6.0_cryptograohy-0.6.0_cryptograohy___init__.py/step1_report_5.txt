  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing core functions and invoking the command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing 'greet' from .core and 'cli' from .cly.",
  "sinks": "Calling cli() at the end, which could potentially execute command-line interface code.",
  "flows": "Importing functions (greet, cli) and executing cli() directly upon import.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate invocation of cli() at import time may be unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from internal modules and then calls cli(). This pattern suggests the package executes its command-line interface upon import, which could be unconventional and possibly malicious if cli() performs unexpected actions. However, without seeing the implementation of cli(), it is impossible to determine malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious operations such as data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing initialization and running a CLI. No malicious behavior is evident from this fragment, but executing cli() at import time could be risky depending on its implementation. Overall, no malicious intent is apparent from this code snippet alone.",
