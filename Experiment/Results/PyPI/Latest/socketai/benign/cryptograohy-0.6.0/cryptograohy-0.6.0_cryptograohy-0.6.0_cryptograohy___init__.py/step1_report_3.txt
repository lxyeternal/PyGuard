  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing modules and executing the CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Import statements for .core and .cly modules, execution of cli() function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of cli() function as the main sink that likely starts the command-line interface.",
  "flows": "Imports from modules -> execution of cli() which likely uses input data from command line arguments or environment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or commands. The call to cli() is typical for CLI applications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions or modules greet and cli from relative files. Immediately calls cli() upon import. No suspicious or malicious code is evident. The cli() function is presumably the command-line interface entry point, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard __init__.py for a Python package that initializes CLI execution. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident based on this snippet.",
