  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing core functionalities and CLI, then executing the CLI.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'greet' from '.core' and 'cli' from '.cly'. Execution of 'cli()' function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'cli()' may process untrusted command-line input which could trigger further code flows.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; 'cli()' likely executes command-line interface logic that could process user input or arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward import and execution pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two components: 'greet' and 'cli'. It then calls 'cli()' immediately upon module import. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The execution of 'cli()' is typical for command-line tools to process user input; without further details of 'cli()', no malicious behavior can be determined. No external network, data leakage, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization file that imports and executes a command-line interface. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this code fragment.",
