  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing core functions and CLI, then executing the CLI.",
  "sources": "Import statements for .core and .cly modules, and the call to cli().",
  "sinks": "Execution of cli() function, which could potentially invoke user input or external commands.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> execute cli() -> potential user interaction or external process.",
  "anomalies": "The code immediately invokes cli() upon import, which can cause unintended execution when imported as a module; no explicit input validation or security checks evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports functions from local modules and then calls cli(). The immediate invocation of cli() at import time is unusual and could be exploited if cli() handles untrusted input or executes commands unsafely. However, without the implementation details of cli(), no specific malicious behavior can be confirmed. The code itself appears straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials or malicious code evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to initialize and run a command-line interface. The primary concern is the automatic invocation of cli() upon import, which could lead to unintended side effects. No malicious behavior is directly observable from this fragment.",
