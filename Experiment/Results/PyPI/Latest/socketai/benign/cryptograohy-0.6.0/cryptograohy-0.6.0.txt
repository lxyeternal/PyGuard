      "conclusion": "The setup script contains no explicit malicious code or payloads. The only suspicious aspect is the import and instantiation of an external module during installation, which could be exploited if the module is malicious. The misspelling of the package name adds to suspicion but is not conclusive. Overall, the code appears benign but with moderate security concern due to unusual behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The minimal import and object instantiation do not constitute any attack vector or malicious activity. The scores should be adjusted to reflect zero risk and no obfuscation, i.e., malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0."

      "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not contain malicious content. The primary issue is the immediate execution of 'cli()' at import time, which could be problematic in certain contexts. No evidence suggests malicious activity, and the scores are consistent with this assessment."
