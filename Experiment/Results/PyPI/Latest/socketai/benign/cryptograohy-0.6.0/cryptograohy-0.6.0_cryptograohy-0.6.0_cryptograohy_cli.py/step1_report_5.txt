  "purpose": "Initialize and run the 'cli' function which creates an instance of 'EmojiConverter' from the 'pyprettifier' package.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'pyprettifier' package and instantiating 'EmojiConverter'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pyprettifier' -> instantiation of 'EmojiConverter' object.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. The import occurs within the function, which is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party package 'pyprettifier' and creates an instance of 'EmojiConverter'. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no external network communication. The import is local within the 'cli' function, which is uncommon but not suspicious. No suspicious behavior or malicious code is evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and performs a simple initialization of a third-party object. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The use of import within the function is unusual but not malicious. Overall, this appears benign.",
