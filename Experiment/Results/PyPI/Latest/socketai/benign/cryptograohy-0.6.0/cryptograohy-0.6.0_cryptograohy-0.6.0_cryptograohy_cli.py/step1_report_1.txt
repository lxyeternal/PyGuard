  "purpose": "Initialize and run an emoji conversion utility via command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'pyprettifier' and instantiation of 'EmojiConverter' object.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "Import 'pyprettifier' -> create 'EmojiConverter' instance -> function ends.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'cli' which imports a third-party library 'pyprettifier' and creates an instance of 'EmojiConverter'. The import and instantiation are straightforward and do not involve any external inputs or outputs. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The code is minimal, simple, and appears to be for a CLI utility, likely for emoji conversion. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a minimal CLI entry point for an emoji converter. No malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks identified.",
