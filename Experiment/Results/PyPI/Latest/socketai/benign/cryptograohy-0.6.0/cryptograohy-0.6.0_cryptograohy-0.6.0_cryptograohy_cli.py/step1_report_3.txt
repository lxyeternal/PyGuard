  "sources": "Import statement for 'pyprettifier', instantiation of 'EmojiConverter' object.",
  "sinks": "Object instantiation; no untrusted data output or external calls observed.",
  "flows": "Import 'pyprettifier' -> create 'EmojiConverter' instance -> execute cli() function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pyprettifier' package and creates an instance of 'EmojiConverter' within the 'cli' function, which is then executed immediately. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or data leaks. The code appears straightforward and serves as a command-line interface entry point. No suspicious behavior or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI entry point that uses the 'pyprettifier' library to convert emojis. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment.",
