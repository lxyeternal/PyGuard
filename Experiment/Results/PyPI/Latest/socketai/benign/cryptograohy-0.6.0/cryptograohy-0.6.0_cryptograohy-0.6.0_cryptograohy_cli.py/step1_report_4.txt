  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data output or network connections.",
  "flows": "Import of the library, then instantiation of EmojiConverter; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library 'pyprettifier' and creates an instance of 'EmojiConverter'. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no user input, no network activity, and no suspicious logic. The library itself is not detailed here, but the usage shown is benign. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to simply instantiate an object from a third-party library without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no security risks or malware indications based on this code snippet.",
