  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for a SQL query builder, with no malicious intent, external untrusted input, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, appropriate for test code, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0. The overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the low but non-zero inherent risk of test environments."
