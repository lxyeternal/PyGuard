  "purpose": "A Python library designed for building and executing database queries.",
  "sources": "No specific input or data reading code present.",
  "sinks": "No direct output or data handling that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows; code does not process untrusted input in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is only a descriptive comment; it does not contain executable code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a simple comment describing the purpose of the library. There is no functional code, no data processing, no input/output operations, and no security-sensitive actions. Without executable code, there are no apparent security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The absence of code indicates a very low risk profile.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a non-executable comment describing a Python library for database queries. It shows no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. Based on this, the overall risk is negligible.",
