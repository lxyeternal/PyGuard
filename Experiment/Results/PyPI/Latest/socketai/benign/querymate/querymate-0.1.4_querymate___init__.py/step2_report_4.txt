  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the provided code is merely a descriptive comment (docstring) about the \"QueryMate\" library.\n   - There are no functions, data flows, input/output handling, or executable logic present in any of the snippets.\n   - As such, there are no actual security issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors to detect.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is non-executable documentation.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent; the conclusions that there's no malware or security risk are justified given the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the absence of code execution or suspicious patterns.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no executable code, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious intent, the overall risk should be negligible.\n   - The current risk scores of 0 or 0.5 are appropriate; none warrant a higher score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there is no malware present.\n   - This aligns with the content being only a descriptive comment.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as non-functional documentation.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious activity are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1.0), which is justified given the clear absence of executable code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\nGiven the evidence, I would also assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security concerns.**",
