  "purpose": "The code performs remote synchronization of directories using rsync over SSH, with credentials and paths provided via environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: UNCLUSTER_SSH_HOST, UNCLUSTER_SSH_USER, UNCLUSTER_SSH_PASSWORD, UNCLUSTER_REMOTE_SRC, UNCLUSTER_LOCAL_DEST; Function parameters: remote_src, local_dest.",
  "sinks": "The constructed rsync command executes a system call; environment variables are read for credentials; pexpect interacts with the command process to handle prompts, potentially exposing passwords if logs are enabled.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and function parameters serve as sources; the rsync command with user credentials is built; pexpect manages interaction prompts (host key confirmation, password input); command output is logged if verbose; process exit status indicates success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "Uses pexpect to automate SSH prompt responses, which may expose sensitive info in logs if verbose logging is enabled. The code expects specific prompts and sends responses automatically, which could be exploited if manipulated. No hardcoded credentials are present, but reliance on environment variables for passwords is noteworthy.",
  "analysis": "The script securely retrieves environment variables for SSH credentials and paths. It constructs an rsync command to synchronize directories, handling SSH prompts through pexpect. While it automates SSH interactions, this process could reveal sensitive data in logs if verbose mode is used. No suspicious code or backdoors are present. The code follows standard patterns for remote sync with environment-based configuration. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The handling of prompts is straightforward and typical for automation scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate directory synchronization over SSH, with no evidence of malicious behavior. It relies on environment variables for sensitive data and automates SSH prompts securely. No malicious or sabotage code was detected. The main security consideration is ensuring verbose logs are managed properly to avoid leaking secrets.",
