  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; no external data or output operations are observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs a module export setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual or suspicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function from a local module and exposes it via __all__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no embedded logic, external network calls, or data processing. No indications of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module export statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is standard Python packaging practice.",
