{
  "purpose": "The code exports the 'uncluster' function or object from the local module '.uncluster', likely for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'uncluster' object from a relative module '.uncluster'. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are evident in this fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows within this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, only re-exporting an imported object. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports 'uncluster' from a local module and exposes it via __all__. No code execution, data handling, or security-relevant operations occur here. The simplicity suggests standard package structure without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module export statement with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. It appears to be normal code for exposing functionality.",
