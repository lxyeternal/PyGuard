  "purpose": "Expose the 'uncluster' function from the local uncluster module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'uncluster' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows related to untrusted input; no network or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources or external outputs; only module import and export.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a function 'uncluster' from a relative module and exposes it via __all__. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code. The simplicity reduces risk; however, without inspecting 'uncluster', the full security context cannot be confirmed, but the given snippet itself appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal and standard module export pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security risks based solely on the provided content.",
