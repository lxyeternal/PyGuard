  "purpose": "A minimal Python module that imports a function 'uncluster' from a local module and exposes it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .uncluster module",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data flows",
  "flows": "Import from local module to module export; no data flow involving untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports 'uncluster' from a local module and exposes it via __all__. It contains no data processing, network activity, or suspicious constructs. The code follows standard Python packaging practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and transparency of the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are justified. No further action or changes are necessary; the code is safe.",
