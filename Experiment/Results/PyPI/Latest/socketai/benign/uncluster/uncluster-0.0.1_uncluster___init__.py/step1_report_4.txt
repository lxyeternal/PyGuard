{
  "purpose": "The code exports the 'uncluster' function from a local module, likely part of a package that provides clustering and unclustered data handling.",
  "sources": "Imports 'uncluster' from a local module '.uncluster'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code simply imports and exposes a function, no data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a standard import and export operation. It does not include any data processing, user input handling, or network communication. The import is from a relative module, which is typical in Python packages. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module export statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical pattern used in Python packages to expose functionality.",
