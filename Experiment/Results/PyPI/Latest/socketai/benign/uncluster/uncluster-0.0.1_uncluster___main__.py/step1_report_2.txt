  "purpose": "CLI tool to mirror a remote folder locally using rsync, based on user input.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (--remote, --local, --verbose), user input in the prompt loop.",
  "sinks": "uncluster function invocation, print statements, sys.exit calls.",
  "flows": "Arguments are parsed, user prompted for input, uncluster called repeatedly unless 'q' is entered, errors cause program termination.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated patterns observed. The uncluster function's implementation is not provided, so its behavior cannot be evaluated.",
  "analysis": "The script parses remote and local directory paths from command-line arguments and prompts the user to press Enter to sync or 'q' to quit. It then calls an external function 'uncluster' repeatedly in a loop based on user input. Error handling via try-except manages interruptions and other exceptions. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network connections within this code. The key external dependency 'uncluster' is unknown, so potential malicious behavior might originate there but cannot be assessed from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a user-interactive CLI for directory synchronization using an external 'uncluster' function. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this script alone. Its security depends on the behavior of 'uncluster', which is not provided. Overall, the script appears benign.",
