  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for directory mirroring via rsync, prompting user for synchronization.",
  "sources": "User input via input() for command confirmation; command-line arguments for remote and local directories.",
  "sinks": "External uncluster function receives remote and local paths; no direct sinks of untrusted data within this code.",
  "flows": "User presses Enter to trigger uncluster with provided arguments; 'q' input exits loop; no data flows to external sources beyond argument passing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward command-line interface with minimal logic; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI wrapper that prompts the user to synchronize directories using an external uncluster function. It handles user input and exceptions cleanly. The security concern hinges on the behavior of uncluster, which is not provided. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. Input paths are passed directly to uncluster without validation, which could be risky if uncluster mishandles inputs. The code itself appears benign, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting reliance on an external component. Overall, the script is safe, but the trustworthiness of uncluster must be verified to ensure overall security.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility that delegates directory synchronization to an external function. No malicious activity is evident within this code. The primary security concern depends on the implementation of uncluster. If uncluster is secure, the overall system is safe. The current scores are appropriate given the information.",
