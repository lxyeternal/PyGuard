  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward wrapper for remote synchronization, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are consistent with its function. Proper handling of environment variables is essential but not inherently risky here. Overall, the code appears safe and well-understood."
