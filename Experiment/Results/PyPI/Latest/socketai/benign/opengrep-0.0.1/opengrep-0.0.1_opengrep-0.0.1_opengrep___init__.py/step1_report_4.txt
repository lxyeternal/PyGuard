  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the definition of a utility class for encryption and decryption, along with some auxiliary functions for data handling and key management.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function inputs, environment variables, and file I/O (if present). No user input or network sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic functions and possibly outputs data to files or logs. No evidence of malicious sinks such as network transmission or system command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (parameters, environment variables) through cryptographic functions for processing and output. No suspicious data flow patterns identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or unusual behavior detected. Code structure is straightforward, no obfuscation or confusing constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cryptographic libraries and defines functions for encryption/decryption. It manages keys possibly via environment variables or files, and performs standard cryptographic operations. There are no signs of malicious payloads or malicious logic such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for data encryption with standard practices. No anomalies or malicious indicators observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for cryptographic operations with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe based on the provided content.",
