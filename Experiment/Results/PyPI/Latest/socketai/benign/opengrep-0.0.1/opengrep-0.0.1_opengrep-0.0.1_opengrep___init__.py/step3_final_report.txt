  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code content, dynamic execution points (eval/exec), import statements, environment variable usage, data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) to sinks (e.g., eval/exec, network, file system).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, suspicious imports, indirect data flows, hardcoded secrets, unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code contains obfuscated variable names and uses eval/exec, which are common indicators of malicious intent. Suspicious imports and indirect data flows from environment variables suggest potential data exfiltration or malicious control. The benign cryptographic utility code shows no malicious indicators. The suspicion is moderate, with dynamic execution and obfuscation being the primary signals. No confirmed malicious payloads are present, but the patterns warrant caution. The overall security risk is moderate, and malware is unlikely but possible.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns but lacks definitive malicious payloads. The risk and malware scores are appropriately set at moderate levels, reflecting potential concern without confirmed malicious activity.",
