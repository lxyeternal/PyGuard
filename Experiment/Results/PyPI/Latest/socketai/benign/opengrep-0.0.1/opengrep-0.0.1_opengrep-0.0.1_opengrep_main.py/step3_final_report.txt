  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static function with no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
