  "purpose": "Placeholder main function indicating where the Opengrep project code should be implemented",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading operations",
  "sinks": "None; no output, data leak, or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow as there are no sources or sinks",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the print statement is straightforward and harmless",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single main() function that prints a string message. There are no data sources, external input handling, or security-sensitive operations. The code appears to be a stub or placeholder for future implementation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any anomalous or suspicious behavior, and there are no data flows that pose security concerns.",
