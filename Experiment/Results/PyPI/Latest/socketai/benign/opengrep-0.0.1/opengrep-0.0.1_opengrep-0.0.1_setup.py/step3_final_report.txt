  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious dependencies. The dependencies are common packages, and the entry point is standard for CLI tools. The reports provided are empty, offering no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Given the lack of issues, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal.",
