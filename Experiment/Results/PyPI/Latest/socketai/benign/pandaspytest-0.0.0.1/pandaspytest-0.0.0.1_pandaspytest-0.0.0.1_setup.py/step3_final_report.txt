  "purpose": "A minimal setup script defining package metadata with static strings, serving as a placeholder package.",
  "sources": "Static strings in setup() parameters (name, version, author, description, classifiers). No external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, external outputs, or untrusted data flows; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data used directly in setup() without dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional version number '0.0.0.1' but not suspicious; empty author fields are typical placeholders.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setuptools setup script with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The version number and empty author fields are benign placeholders. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, placeholder package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
