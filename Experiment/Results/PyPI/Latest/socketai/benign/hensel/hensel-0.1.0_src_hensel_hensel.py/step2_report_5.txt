  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its purpose, and the reasoning provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements Hensel lifting for modular square roots.\n- Uses input validation, extensive doctests.\n- Imports `egcd` for modular inverse calculations.\n- Performs standard mathematical operations, handles edge cases, especially for prime=2.\n- No network, file, or external command activity.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as a legitimate mathematical implementation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound. No signs of malicious behavior. The use of `egcd` for modular inverse is standard.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the correctness and safety.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Comments:** Very confident, consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on the mathematical nature, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Comments:** No issues; aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, emphasizing the legitimacy and safety.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (still very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Comments:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—legitimate mathematical code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Comments:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are there any signs of malware?** No. The code performs standard mathematical operations for modular square root lifting. It uses a well-understood algorithm, with input validation, and no external network or file I/O.\n- **Is the malware score justified?** Yes, it should be 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and well-documented.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal theoretical misuse, but no actual risk)\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate after careful review:**\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, the code is a straightforward, well-implemented mathematical utility for Hensel lifting, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very minimal, primarily due to potential misuse in an unsafe context, but not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and performs a standard mathematical operation. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores should reflect the absence of malicious activity.",
