{
  "purpose": "Implementation of Hensel lifting for square roots modulo prime powers, intended for mathematical computations involving modular arithmetic.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (`root`, `prime`, `exponent`), imported modules (`egcd`), and the `doctest` module for testing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not send data over the network, write to files, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through mathematical functions and internal calculations; notably, the `_inv` and `_exp` functions process input data, and the `hensel` function performs lifting calculations based on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code is focused on mathematical computations and input validation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code relies on an external `egcd` module, which is standard for extended Euclidean algorithm calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs mathematical operations related to modular arithmetic and Hensel lifting. It includes input validation, ensuring types and ranges are appropriate. The `_inv` function computes modular inverses using an external `egcd` function, which is a standard approach. The main `hensel` function implements the mathematical algorithm with explicit handling for special cases (e.g., prime=2). There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code is well-structured, follows normal mathematical implementation patterns, and only manipulates local variables for computation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a mathematical implementation of Hensel lifting with no indications of malicious intent. It performs safe modular arithmetic operations, with proper input validation and no external side effects or suspicious behaviors. It is a legitimate mathematical utility package component, with a low malware score and security risk. The confidence level in this assessment is high.",
