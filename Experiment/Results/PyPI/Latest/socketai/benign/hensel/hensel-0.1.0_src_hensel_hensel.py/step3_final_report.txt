  "purpose": "Implementation of Hensel lifting for modular square roots, enabling the lifting of roots modulo prime powers.",
  "sources": "Inputs: root, prime, exponent; Uses egcd module for modular inverse calculations.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical operations within the function; no external data flow, network, or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then used in modular arithmetic calculations to produce the lifted root.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns; extensive input validation and doctests; straightforward mathematical code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard implementation of Hensel lifting with proper validation, testing, and documentation. It relies on a well-known external module for modular inverse. No obfuscation, malicious network activity, or hidden behavior detected. The mathematical operations are correct and consistent with the algorithm's purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented mathematical utility for Hensel lifting of modular square roots. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The security risk is minimal, and the confidence in this assessment is high.",
