  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code implements Hensel lifting for modular square roots, with extensive input validation, doctests, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. It relies on an external `egcd` module for modular inverse calculations, which is standard.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, aligning with the analysis.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (0.1), as it performs legitimate mathematical operations.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, high confidence in legitimacy.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the correctness and safety of the implementation, with no malicious signs.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0, indicating no evident security concerns.\n- **Confidence:** 1, very high confidence.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Reiterates the mathematical focus, thorough validation, and safe operations. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, emphasizing the legitimacy and safety of the code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1, still very low.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Consistent with previous reports, confirming the code is a standard mathematical implementation with no malicious signs.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence & behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a legitimate implementation of Hensel lifting for modular square roots.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** All scores are 0, indicating no malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, consistent with the code performing mathematical calculations only.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, mostly 0.9 to 1, confirming trust in the analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**, no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** Given the mathematical nature and thorough validation, a **risk score of 0.1** is appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a legitimate, well-validated implementation of Hensel lifting for modular square roots, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and the high confidence levels support this conclusion.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of the reports and the detailed analysis.",
