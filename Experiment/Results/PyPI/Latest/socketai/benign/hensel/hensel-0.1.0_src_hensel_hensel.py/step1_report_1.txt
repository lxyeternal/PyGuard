  "purpose": "Implementation of Hensel lifting to compute square roots modulo prime powers, used for number theory and cryptographic applications.",
  "sources": "Imports from '__future__' (annotations), 'doctest', and 'egcd' module. Data is read from function parameters and internal calculations.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical operations on inputs, especially modular inverses, exponentiation, and lifting calculations. No external data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then mathematical computations perform the Hensel lifting process, involving inverses, exponent calculations, and root adjustments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code performs standard mathematical operations for Hensel lifting, with extensive input validation and doctest examples.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a mathematical algorithm with detailed input validation, extensive testing via doctests, and clear modular structure. It imports an 'egcd' module for GCD-based inverse calculation, which is appropriate for modular inverse operations. The function handles various edge cases and includes a special case for prime 2, ensuring correctness in lifting roots. No network, system calls, or suspicious data handling are present. The overall structure aligns with legitimate mathematical computation, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of Hensel lifting for modular square roots, with comprehensive input validation and testing. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or suspicious data leaks. It solely performs mathematical calculations relevant to number theory, with no external communications or harmful operations.",
