  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Implementation of Hensel lifting, imports `egcd` for modular inverse, extensive input validation, and doctests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Mathematical operations, no external data output or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, code is straightforward, extensive testing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate mathematical implementation with no signs of malicious behavior. The use of `egcd` is standard, and the code is well-documented and tested.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1 (very low).\n\n**Assessment:** Fully legitimate, mathematically sound, and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the mathematical nature, input validation, and absence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Also legitimate, with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on the same points: mathematical correctness, input validation, no external side effects.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Same conclusion—safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Reiterates the same findings: pure mathematical utility, proper validation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments, safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar analysis: standard modular arithmetic, input validation, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, consistent with the code being a mathematical utility.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, as the code performs standard mathematical operations with thorough validation and no external side effects.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent and well-documented.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, primarily due to the potential misuse in unsafe contexts, but not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-implemented mathematical utility for Hensel lifting of modular square roots. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks based on the provided analysis.",
