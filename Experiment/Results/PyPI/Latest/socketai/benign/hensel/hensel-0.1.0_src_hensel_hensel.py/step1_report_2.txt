  "purpose": "Implementation of Hensel lifting for square roots modulo prime powers, primarily for mathematical computations involving modular arithmetic.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: root, prime, exponent; module imports: egcd for extended GCD calculation; function calls for pow, egcd, and internal helper functions.",
  "sinks": "None observed; the code does not send data over network, write to files, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and used in mathematical calculations; the core logic computes modular square roots via lifting; no external data flows outside function scope.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are detected. The code is focused on mathematical operations, with thorough input validation. No obfuscated code, malicious data leakage, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a mathematical procedure (Hensel lifting) for computing modular square roots, with detailed input validation, and safe mathematical operations. It relies on the egcd library for the extended GCD, used in modular inverse calculations. The code includes doctests for correctness verification, but no network activity, file I/O, or external command execution. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The use of mathematical functions and input validation suggests it's designed for legitimate computational purposes. The only minor concern could be potential misuse if used in an unsafe context, but nothing in the code indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a mathematically focused implementation of Hensel lifting for modular square roots, with thorough input validation and no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and legitimate, primarily intended for cryptographic or number-theoretic applications.",
