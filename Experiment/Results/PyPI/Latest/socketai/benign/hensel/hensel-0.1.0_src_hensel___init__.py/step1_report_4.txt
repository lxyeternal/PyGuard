{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide access to the 'hensel' function from the 'hensel.hensel' module, likely for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'hensel' from 'hensel.hensel'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; only an import statement present",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies, secrets, or unusual patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and an import statement. The comment suggests allowing user access to a function, but no actual function calls or user input handling are present. The imported module 'hensel' from 'hensel.hensel' could be part of a cryptographic or mathematical library; without further code, no malicious behavior can be inferred. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs, backdoors, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple import with a comment. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this minimal code. It appears benign and does not pose security concerns by itself.",
