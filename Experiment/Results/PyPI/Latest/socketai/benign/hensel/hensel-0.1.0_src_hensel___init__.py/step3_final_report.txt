  "purpose": "Import the 'hensel' module from the 'hensel.hensel' package, potentially to expose its functions for user access.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "None; the import is static and does not involve data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple import statement with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no additional logic, data handling, or malicious behavior. The comments suggest user access but do not imply malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation or backdoors are present. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal exposure. The code is benign and standard in Python, with no vulnerabilities or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
