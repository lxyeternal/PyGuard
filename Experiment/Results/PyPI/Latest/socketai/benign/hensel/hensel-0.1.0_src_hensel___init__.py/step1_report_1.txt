  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple module import statement, possibly for exposing the 'hensel' function or class to users.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'hensel.hensel' indicates reading the module 'hensel' from the 'hensel' package.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present in this minimal snippet; it only imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "The comment suggests enabling direct user access, but there are no security-relevant operations, credentials, or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with an accompanying comment. It does not contain any data processing, input handling, or potentially malicious operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The import statement itself is standard Python practice and does not introduce security risks. The comment is benign and appears to describe functionality rather than instruct malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It is a straightforward import statement with a descriptive comment. No malware or security risks are evident.",
