{
  "purpose": "Importing the 'hensel' function or module from the 'hensel.hensel' package, potentially for cryptographic or mathematical operations.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from hensel.hensel import hensel' suggests that the code may use the 'hensel' function or object from the specified package.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code potentially flows from the imported 'hensel' to any subsequent use (not shown here). Since no usage is demonstrated, no flow is observable.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; it only contains an import statement with no further logic, parameters, or execution. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module or function from a package named 'hensel'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The import statement by itself is benign; without additional context or usage, it cannot be considered malicious. The comment suggests direct user access but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears benign, with no anomalies or malicious indicators present.",
