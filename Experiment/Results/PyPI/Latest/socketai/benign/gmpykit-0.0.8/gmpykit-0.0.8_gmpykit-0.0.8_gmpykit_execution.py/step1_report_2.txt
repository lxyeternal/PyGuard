{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and functions to run a specified function repeatedly at fixed time intervals using threading.Timer.",
  "sources": "The code reads the function to be decorated and the interval seconds parameter from the decorator arguments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects; no external data or network operations are performed.",
  "flows": "The decorator captures the function and interval, then set_interval schedules repeated execution via threading.Timer, which calls itself recursively.",
  "anomalies": "The recursive call within func_wrapper (set_interval(func, sec)) can cause unbounded scheduling of timers, potentially leading to resource exhaustion. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or system harm is evident, but the design could cause runaway timers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'deco_interval' for repeated execution of a function every 'sec' seconds. The inner function 'set_interval' schedules the function via threading.Timer, and recursively calls itself within 'func_wrapper'. This creates a repeating timer. No external data sources, network operations, or malicious code are present. The recursion may cause multiple timers to stack if not managed properly, which could be problematic but not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of repeated function execution using threading.Timer. It does not contain malicious behavior but has a potential for resource mismanagement due to recursive timer scheduling. No malware or security threats are evident.",
