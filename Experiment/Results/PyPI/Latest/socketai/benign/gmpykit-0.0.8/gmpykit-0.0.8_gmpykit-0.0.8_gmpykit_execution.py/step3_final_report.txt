{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator for scheduling a function to run repeatedly at specified intervals using threading.Timer, with recursive calls that can lead to unbounded thread creation.",
  "sources": "The decorator deco_interval captures the function; set_interval reads the function and arguments; threading.Timer is used to schedule the next call.",
  "sinks": "The recursive call within set_interval leads to continuous thread creation, which can exhaust system resources if misused.",
  "flows": "The decorator wraps a function, which is scheduled via set_interval; set_interval calls itself recursively through threading.Timer, creating a chain of scheduled threads.",
  "anomalies": "Recursive scheduling without termination or control leads to unbounded thread creation; no external input or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a recursive pattern to schedule repeated execution, which can cause resource exhaustion. No malicious code, data leaks, or external communication is detected. The pattern is a known anti-pattern that can be exploited for denial of service. All reports correctly identify the recursive threading as a flaw, with no evidence of malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately 0; the security risk score varies from 0.2 to 0.6 depending on the perceived potential for abuse. The higher score (0.6) is justified given the risk of resource exhaustion if exploited. Confidence in the assessment is high, as the pattern is straightforward and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility with a significant flaw in recursive thread scheduling, which can be exploited to cause resource exhaustion, but it contains no malicious code. The malware score is 0; the risk score should be around 0.4-0.6, with 0.6 justified for potential abuse. The obfuscated score is 0. Overall, the pattern is dangerous if misused but not inherently malicious.",
