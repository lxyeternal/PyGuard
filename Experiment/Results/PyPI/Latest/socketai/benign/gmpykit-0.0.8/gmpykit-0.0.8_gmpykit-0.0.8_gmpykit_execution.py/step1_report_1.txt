  "purpose": "Provides a decorator to repeatedly execute a function at specified intervals using threading timers.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; internal function calls only.",
  "sinks": "Calls set_interval recursively, which initiates threading.Timer for delayed execution.",
  "flows": "Decorator wraps a function, which when called, schedules itself to run repeatedly at set intervals via threading.Timer.",
  "anomalies": "Recursive call to set_interval inside func_wrapper could lead to unbounded threading creation; no termination or stopping condition. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'deco_interval' that schedules repeated execution of a function at specified intervals (default 3600 seconds). It uses threading.Timer to asynchronously invoke the function repeatedly. The 'set_interval' function calls itself recursively within 'func_wrapper', which could lead to an unbounded number of threads being created over time if not managed or stopped. There are no external inputs, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The code's structure appears to be for scheduling tasks, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a recurring task scheduler using threading.Timer with potential for uncontrolled thread creation, but it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks by itself. It is a utility function for scheduled execution, not malware.",
