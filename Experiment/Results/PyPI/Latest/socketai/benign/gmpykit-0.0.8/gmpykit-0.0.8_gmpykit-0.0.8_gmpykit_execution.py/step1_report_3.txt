{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to repeatedly execute a function at specified intervals using threading timers.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it only uses function arguments and internal threading timers.",
  "sinks": "Potential misuse could involve untrusted functions being decorated, but no direct sinks for untrusted data are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the flow is within controlled function calls and timers.",
  "anomalies": "The recursive call within 'func_wrapper' might cause unintended repeated scheduling if misused, but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'deco_interval' that schedules a function to run periodically with a specified interval (default 3600 seconds). The 'set_interval' function employs threading.Timer to repeatedly invoke the target function by recursively scheduling itself. No external input, data leaks, or malicious code is detected. The logic is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior or obfuscation. The recursive scheduling is a common pattern for periodic tasks, assuming correct usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a simple, standard pattern for periodic execution of functions using threading. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The recursive scheduling could potentially cause unintended repeated calls if misconfigured but is not malicious per se.",
