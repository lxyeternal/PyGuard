{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to get the current timestamp and format durations into human-readable strings.",
  "sources": "datetime.now().timestamp() for current time; function parameters 'duration' and 'fixed_format' for input data.",
  "sinks": "Return statements generating formatted strings; no untrusted data used in vulnerable sinks.",
  "flows": "Input from datetime.now().timestamp() flows into now(); 'duration' input flows through format_duration to produce formatted string output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. No dynamic execution or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code includes two functions: one retrieves the current timestamp, the other converts a duration in seconds into a formatted string. The timestamp function simply calls a standard library method and returns an integer, which is safe. The formatting function performs straightforward calculations and string formatting without any external input processing beyond the 'duration' parameter, which is used only for calculations. No untrusted data sources or sinks, no external calls, no file operations, and no dynamic code execution are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for time-related formatting and timestamp retrieval. There is no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
