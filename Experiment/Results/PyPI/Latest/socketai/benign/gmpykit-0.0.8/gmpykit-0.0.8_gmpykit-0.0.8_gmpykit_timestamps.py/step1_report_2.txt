{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to get the current timestamp and format a duration in seconds into a human-readable string.",
  "sources": "The current timestamp is obtained from datetime.now().timestamp()",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; the functions only perform calculations and string formatting.",
  "flows": "The timestamp source flows into the now() function, which returns an integer timestamp. The format_duration() processes an input duration and outputs a formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code uses standard library functions and simple calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: now() and format_duration(). The now() function retrieves the current Unix timestamp in seconds, converting it to an integer. The format_duration() function converts a duration in seconds into a formatted string showing years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The calculations use fixed average durations for months and years, and the string formatting is straightforward. There is no external data input other than the duration parameter for format_duration(), which is expected to be a float. The code performs simple, predictable operations with no network access, no file manipulation, and no dynamic code execution. Overall, the code is benign and performs utility functions without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a harmless utility module for timestamp and duration formatting, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
