  "purpose": "Utility functions for retrieving current timestamp and formatting durations into human-readable strings.",
  "sources": "datetime.now().timestamp() in now(); duration parameter in format_duration()",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "now() calls datetime.now().timestamp(); format_duration() processes input duration into string",
  "anomalies": "Unused parameter 'fixed_format' in format_duration(); fixed average durations for months and years, but acceptable for formatting purposes",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library functions for time retrieval and arithmetic for formatting durations. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The functions perform simple, well-understood operations. The 'fixed_format' parameter is unused, which is a minor code quality issue but not security-related. The duration calculations use fixed averages, which may be imprecise but are acceptable for display purposes. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and accurate. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
