{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to retrieve the current timestamp and to format a duration (in seconds) into a human-readable string.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time using datetime.now().timestamp() and input parameter 'duration' in the format_duration function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; the code only processes and returns formatted strings or timestamps.",
  "flows": "The current timestamp is retrieved from system time and returned as an integer. The format_duration function processes the input 'duration' to generate a formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library functions to get current system time and perform straightforward calculations to convert seconds into years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. It formats the output in a readable string. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The functions are simple utilities with no external data inputs other than system time and function parameters. No malicious or harmful operations are performed.\n\nOverall, the code is benign, well-structured, and does not pose security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility module for timestamp retrieval and duration formatting with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
