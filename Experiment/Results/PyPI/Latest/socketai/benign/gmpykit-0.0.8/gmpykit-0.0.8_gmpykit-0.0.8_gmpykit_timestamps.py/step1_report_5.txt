{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to retrieve the current timestamp and format a duration in seconds into a human-readable string.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time via datetime.now().timestamp() and takes duration input as a float parameter in format_duration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or security effects. No untrusted data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "The source (datetime.now().timestamp()) provides data used internally; no external or untrusted data flows are identified. The format_duration function processes input durations without involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code performs straightforward time calculations and formatting without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The now() function retrieves the current timestamp in seconds as an integer, which is standard and poses no security risks. The format_duration() function decomposes a float duration into years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds, then formats this into a string. All calculations are basic arithmetic with no dynamic code execution, input validation issues, or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears purely utility-based and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for time retrieval and formatting, with no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. It functions as expected without any indications of sabotage or malware.",
