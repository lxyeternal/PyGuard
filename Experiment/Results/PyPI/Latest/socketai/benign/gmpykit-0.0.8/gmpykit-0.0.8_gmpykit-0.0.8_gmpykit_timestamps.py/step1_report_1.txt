  "purpose": "The code provides functions to get the current timestamp and to format a duration in seconds into a human-readable string.",
  "sources": "The function now() reads system time via datetime.now(). The format_duration() function takes a duration in seconds as input.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data externally; it only processes and returns formatted strings based on input values.",
  "flows": "The now() function retrieves the system timestamp, which could be used as a source of system time. The format_duration() processes input duration data but does not utilize or transfer data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No use of external libraries or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, converting timestamps and durations into formatted strings. It relies solely on Python's standard datetime library to access system time and performs simple arithmetic operations to break down durations into years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The formatting functions generate human-readable strings. There are no external data transmissions, no input validation issues, nor any unusual code constructs. The functions serve utility purposes without any indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for time retrieval and formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this module.",
