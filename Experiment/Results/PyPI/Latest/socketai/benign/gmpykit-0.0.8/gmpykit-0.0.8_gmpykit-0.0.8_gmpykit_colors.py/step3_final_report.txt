  "purpose": "Generate a random hex color code by selecting random RGB components.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the `randrange` function calls generating three random integers for R, G, B components.",
  "sinks": "The code returns a color string; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Random integers from `randrange` flow into hex conversion, then concatenated into a color string.",
  "anomalies": "The only minor anomaly is that `randrange(0, 255)` generates values from 0 to 254, not 255, but this does not impact functionality or security.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a non-cryptographic random color generator. It uses standard library functions appropriately, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior. The `randrange` function's upper bound excludes 255, but since the purpose is color generation, this is acceptable. The code does not perform any data leaks, network activity, or system modifications. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assign a malware score of 0, and confidence of 1. The risk scores are also 0, consistent with the absence of security issues. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility function for generating random colors. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No security risks or malicious behaviors are detected. The code can be safely used as-is.",
