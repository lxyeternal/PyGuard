  "purpose": "Generate a random hexadecimal color code.",
  "sources": "randrange function from the random module for generating random numbers.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the generated color code; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "randrange generates numbers → converts to hex → formats as color string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code uses standard random functions for color generation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the randrange function from the random module and defines a function get_random_color() that generates three random integers between 0 and 254. Each integer is converted to a two-digit hexadecimal string and concatenated to form a color code in the format '#RRGGBB'. There are no external data inputs or untrusted sources other than the standard library, and the process is straightforward for generating random colors. No malicious behavior or anomalies are detected, and the code performs its intended function securely and transparently.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign function for generating random colors. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
