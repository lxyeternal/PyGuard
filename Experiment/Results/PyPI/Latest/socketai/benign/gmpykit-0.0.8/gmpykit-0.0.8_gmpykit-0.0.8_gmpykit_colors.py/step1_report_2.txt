  "purpose": "Generate a random hexadecimal color code",
  "sources": "randrange function from the random module",
  "targets": "hex conversion and string concatenation for returning color code",
  "flows": "randrange outputs are converted to hex strings and concatenated to form a color code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports randrange for generating random numbers, then defines a function to produce a color code by generating three random values for red, green, and blue channels. Each value is converted to a two-digit hex string and concatenated with a '#' prefix. The process is straightforward, with no data leakage, external communication, or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign function to generate a random color code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
