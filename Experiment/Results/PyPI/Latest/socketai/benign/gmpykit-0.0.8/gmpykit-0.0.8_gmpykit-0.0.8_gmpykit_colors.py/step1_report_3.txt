  "purpose": "Generate a random hex color code.",
  "sources": "randrange from the random module, called three times to generate RGB values.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the color string; no untrusted data sink involved.",
  "flows": "randrange outputs are converted to hex strings, concatenated, and returned as a color code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, simple random color generator.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the randrange function and uses it to generate three random integers between 0 and 254. These are converted to hexadecimal strings, zero-padded to two characters, and concatenated to form a color code. There are no hardcoded secrets, no data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The code does not interact with external systems or perform any insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard implementation of a random color generator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
