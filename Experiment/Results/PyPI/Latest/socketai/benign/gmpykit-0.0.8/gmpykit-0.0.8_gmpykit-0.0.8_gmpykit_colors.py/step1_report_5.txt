  "purpose": "Generate a random hex color code",
  "sources": "randrange() function from the random module",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing the color code; no external data sinks or output channels",
  "flows": "randrange() outputs feed into hex conversion, which are then concatenated and returned",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected; uses standard library functions for randomness",
  "analysis": "The code imports randrange from the random module to generate three random integers between 0 and 254 (since randrange upper bound is exclusive). These integers are converted to hexadecimal strings, zero-padded, and concatenated to form a color code string. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors. The randomness used is appropriate for generating colors and does not involve insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code securely generates a random color code using standard Python functions. It does not contain any malicious intent or security risks.",
