  "purpose": "Generate a random hexadecimal color code.",
  "sources": "randrange function from the random module, which generates random integers for color components.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the color code; no untrusted data or external effects involved.",
  "flows": "randrange generates random numbers -> converts to hex -> assembles color string -> returns color code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior present. Use of random number generator is typical for color generation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the randrange function, defines a function to generate random RGB color components, converts them to hex strings, and concatenates them into a color code. The random module used is standard and appropriate for non-cryptographic randomness. No data leaks, no malicious code, and no suspicious activity are observed. The purpose is straightforward, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply generates a random color code and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign utility function.",
