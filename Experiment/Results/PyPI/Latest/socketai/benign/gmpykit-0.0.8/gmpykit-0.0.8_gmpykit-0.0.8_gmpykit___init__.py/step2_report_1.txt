  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Only import statements from internal modules; no data processing, external inputs, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies this as benign, with no malicious activity or security concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1—standard import statements from internal modules, no data flow or external input handling.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Comments:** No issues here; the assessment aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, just import statements, no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, Malware score: 0. This is slightly above zero, implying a minimal perceived risk.\n- **Justification:** Since the code is purely import statements, a risk score of 0.1 seems overly cautious. Unless there's context suggesting these modules could be malicious, this should be 0.\n- **Recommendation:** Lower the security risk score to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—only import statements, no suspicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2, Malware: 0. Again, this seems unnecessarily elevated given the benign code.\n- **Recommendation:** Adjust the security risk score down to 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Pure import statements, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Comments:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and consists solely of import statements.\n- The malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores in Reports 3 and 4 are slightly elevated (0.1 and 0.2), but given the code's nature, they should be 0.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** All should be 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Remains 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be 0 for all reports, since this code is just imports with no security implications.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence that the code is a standard, benign module import setup with no malicious or suspicious activity.",
