  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is just import statements from internal modules, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No suspicious behavior or code anomalies are present. The confidence is high, and the scores seem appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward import statements with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Again, the reasoning aligns with the code. The code is standard and benign.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard import statements with no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The security risk score is very low, justified by the absence of suspicious activity. The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), perhaps because it’s based solely on static analysis of import statements.\n- **Verdict:** The risk score of 0.1 seems reasonable; no change necessary.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—benign import statements, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is marginally higher but still low, reflecting minimal concern. The confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable; no change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as others—import statements only, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is benign.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0 to 0.2), justified given the code only contains import statements with no runtime behavior or data flow.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- Since the code is purely import statements, the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The risk scores are minimal, reflecting the low likelihood of security issues in static import statements.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (average of the small risk scores), as the code is benign but acknowledging the minimal inherent risk in static import structures.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code snippet. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
