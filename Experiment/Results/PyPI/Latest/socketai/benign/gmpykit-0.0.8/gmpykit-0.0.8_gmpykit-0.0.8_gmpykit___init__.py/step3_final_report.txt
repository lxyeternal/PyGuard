  "purpose": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, indicating setup or configuration for a larger project without executing any data processing or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules such as dataframes, strings, cache, charts, colors, dates, eta, file, math, execution, timestamps, and xml.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows; the code only imports modules, establishing no source-to-sink data paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup with import statements from internal modules, with no data processing, external input handling, or dynamic execution. The absence of suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns indicates a benign purpose. The minimal risk scores in previous reports (0.1-0.2) are unjustified given the static nature of the code. The malware score is correctly 0, and obfuscation is absent. The slight elevation in risk scores reflects conservative estimation but does not indicate actual security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores should be set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 to accurately reflect its safety profile.",
