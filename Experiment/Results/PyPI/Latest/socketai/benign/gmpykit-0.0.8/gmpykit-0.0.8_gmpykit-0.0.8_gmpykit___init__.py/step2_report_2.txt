  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of import statements from internal modules.\n- No external inputs, data processing, or execution occurs in this snippet.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be a standard module setup for a larger project.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & sources/targets/flows/anomalies:** Correctly states that it's standard import code with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious activity or security risks.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0 (correct)  \n  - Confidence: 1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the imports.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero) — but given the benign code, this is probably too high.  \n  - Confidence: 1\n\n**Recommendation:** Since there's no malicious activity, the security risk should be **0**. A score of 0.1 seems unjustified, as the code is purely import statements with no potential attack vectors.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Also correctly describes the code as standard import statements.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — again, possibly too high for such benign code.  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 (acceptable, but could be 1)\n\n**Recommendation:** The risk score should be **0** because no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Same conclusion: benign import statements.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — still unjustified given the code's nature.  \n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Recommendation:** Risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Also correctly states the benign nature.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Confidence: 1\n\n**Summary of all reports:**\n- All correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- The only inconsistency is the small risk scores (>0) in some reports, which are unjustified given the benign, static import code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All are correctly at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are correctly at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0** for all reports, as there is no activity that introduces security risk.\n- **Confidence:** Mostly at 1, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions that this code is benign. Therefore:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis reflects the fact that the code is just import statements, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores in some reports (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2 for risk) should be lowered to 0 to align with the actual security assessment.",
