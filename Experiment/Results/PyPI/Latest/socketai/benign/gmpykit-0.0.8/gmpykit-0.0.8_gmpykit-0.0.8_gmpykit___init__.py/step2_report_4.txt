  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** Only import statements from internal modules; no execution, data flow, or external input.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Clearly 0.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this code is benign, with no malicious indicators.  \n- **Score justification:** The scores seem appropriate given the lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as Report 1—only internal imports, no data flows or external inputs.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity is suggested.  \n- **Score justification:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar import-only code with no external inputs or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower at 0.9, but still high.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — this is very low, perhaps reflecting cautiousness but no real concern.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Score justification:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) is acceptable given cautious default, but still minimal.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Import statements only, no data flow or external inputs.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — again, very low, perhaps a conservative estimate.  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies benign nature; no malicious indicators.  \n- **Score justification:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as others—only imports, no active data processing or external data handling.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with other reports; no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Score justification:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward import statements with no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting cautious but unwarranted concern given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the analysis, **the scores are consistent and reasonable** across all reports. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks based solely on these import statements.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity evident.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk:** 0 — minimal risk, as no data flow or external inputs are involved.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is benign, purely consisting of import statements from internal modules, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The current scores reflect this understanding appropriately.",
