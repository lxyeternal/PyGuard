  "purpose": "Compute the binomial coefficient using factorials.",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters n and k are used to calculate factorials and produce a numeric result.",
  "anomalies": "The formula implemented is incorrect for binomial coefficients; it uses multiplication instead of the proper combination formula, but this is a logical flaw, not malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to calculate a binomial coefficient but implements an incorrect formula by multiplying k with factorial(n - k) instead of dividing by the factorial of k. There are no sources of external or untrusted data, no sinks that could leak data, and no anomalous or malicious code structures. The code is straightforward and uses standard math library functions without obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple mathematical calculation with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It contains a logical error in the binomial coefficient formula, but this is unrelated to security concerns. No malware or security risks are present.",
