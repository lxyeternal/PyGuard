  "sources": "Input parameters n and k for the function binomial_nb.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a numeric result; no external or untrusted data output observed.",
  "flows": "Input n, k -> Calculation using math.factorial -> Return of result.",
  "anomalies": "The implementation of binomial coefficient calculation is incorrect; it uses k instead of n - k in the denominator, leading to incorrect results but no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to compute binomial coefficients using factorials. It accepts integer inputs n and k, then computes the result as round(math.factorial(n) / (k * math.factorial(n - k))). The use of math.factorial indicates reliance on standard math library functions, with no external data inputs or outputs, and no network activity. The calculation contains a logical mistake: the standard binomial coefficient formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), but here, the code divides by k instead of k!. Despite the incorrect implementation, there is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior in the code. The primary concern is the incorrect algorithm, not security.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an incorrect calculation of the binomial coefficient but contains no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It does not read external untrusted data, send data externally, or perform harmful actions. The main issue is a logical error rather than malicious intent.",
