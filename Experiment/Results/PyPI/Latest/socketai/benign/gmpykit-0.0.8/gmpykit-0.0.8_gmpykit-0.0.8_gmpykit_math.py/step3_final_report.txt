  "purpose": "Calculate the binomial coefficient (n choose k).",
  "sources": "Input parameters n and k.",
  "sinks": "Return value of the binomial coefficient calculation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters n and k are used in factorial calculations, leading to the final binomial coefficient output.",
  "anomalies": "Incorrect division by k instead of factorial(k); use of round() is unnecessary; no external data or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to compute the binomial coefficient but incorrectly divides by k instead of factorial(k). The use of round() is redundant because factorials are integers, and division of factorials should produce an integer result if correctly implemented. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The logical error affects correctness but not security. The scores from reports are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a logical bug in the binomial coefficient calculation but shows no malicious intent or malicious code. The primary issue is correctness, not security. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. The security risk score should be set to 0.1 to reflect the incorrect implementation's potential for miscalculations in security-sensitive contexts, but it does not constitute a security vulnerability.",
