  "purpose": "Calculate the binomial coefficient (n choose k).",
  "sources": "Input parameters n and k, used in math.factorial calculations.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or output leading to data leak or system effect.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> math.factorial -> calculation -> return result.",
  "anomalies": "The formula used for binomial coefficient is incorrect; it divides by (k * factorial(n - k)) instead of (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k)), which indicates a logical error but not malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to compute a binomial coefficient but implements the calculation incorrectly. It uses 'round' instead of integer division, which can cause inaccuracies. There are no external data sources, system calls, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward mathematical function with a logical error, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The primary concern is a logical error in the binomial coefficient calculation, not malicious intent or harmful activity.",
