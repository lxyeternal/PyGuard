  "purpose": "Calculate a binomial coefficient using factorials.",
  "sources": "Input parameters n and k for the function.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data leaks or untrusted outputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters n and k are used in the factorial calculations to produce the output.",
  "anomalies": "Incorrect implementation of binomial coefficient formula; the denominator should be k! instead of k, which could cause incorrect results but not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to compute binomial coefficients. It imports math and uses factorial to calculate the combination. The formula used is incorrect (dividing by k * factorial(n - k)) instead of k! * factorial(n - k)), which may lead to inaccurate results. There are no external data sources, no data leaks, no obfuscated or malicious code present. The function is straightforward, and there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code patterns. No network activity or system modifications are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or malware, though it implements an incorrect formula for binomial coefficients. The primary concern is correctness, not security. No security risks or malware are present.",
