  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'gmpykit', including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version number from './version.txt'",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Reading version from file → Passing version to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of external version file; no suspicious code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a version string from a file named 'version.txt' and uses setuptools to configure package installation. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data processing occurs. The dependencies listed are standard Python packages. The code structure is typical for package setup and contains no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It reads version info from an external file, which is a common practice, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code.",
