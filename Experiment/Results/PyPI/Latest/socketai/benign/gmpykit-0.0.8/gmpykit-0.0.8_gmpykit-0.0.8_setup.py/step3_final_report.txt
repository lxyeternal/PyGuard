{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, reading version info from an external file and specifying dependencies for package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from './version.txt' file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Reads version from file -> passes data to setup() without modification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward file read and setup call.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a static file read to obtain version info and calls setuptools.setup() with explicit dependencies. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, obfuscation, or handling of untrusted input beyond reading a static file. The dependencies are fixed and explicit, and the code structure is typical for package setup scripts. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's behavior and pose no concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is negligible, and the malware likelihood is zero. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
