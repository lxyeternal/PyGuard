  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic Confirmation:**\n   - The code reads the version number from a local file (`./version.txt`) and uses `setuptools.setup()` to configure package metadata and dependencies.\n   - It explicitly lists dependencies with fixed versions, which is standard practice.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or handling of untrusted input beyond reading a static file.\n   - No suspicious code patterns, secrets, or backdoors are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior.\n   - They do not identify any logical errors or security flaws in the code.\n   - The assessments are consistent and accurate given the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores seem reasonable, as there is no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues or suspicious behaviors are identified; thus, high risk scores are unjustified.\n   - The code is a typical setup script, and the reports reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity—no network activity, no code injection, no hidden payloads.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made; they do not suggest any vulnerabilities or malicious intent without evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis—no malicious or obfuscated code detected, and the security risk is low.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious activity.*\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  *No obfuscation or hidden code patterns are present.*\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n  *No security risks or vulnerabilities are evident.*\n\n### Summary:\nThis is a standard, benign Python package setup script. All evidence points to it being a typical, well-structured setup file with no malicious or obfuscated code. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence presented.",
