  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading and writing JSON and pickle files with minimal validation.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as input to functions; extension checks and file opening operations.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted pickle files being loaded via pickle.load, which can execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Input path -> extension check -> open file -> pickle.load/json.load -> return data",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle.load/dump without validation or sandboxing, potential security risk with untrusted data.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward serialization/deserialization functions with minimal validation. While no malicious code or obfuscation is present, the use of pickle.load without validation poses a security risk if untrusted data is processed. The functions are standard and benign in trusted environments, but the inherent danger of untrusted pickle data warrants a moderate security concern. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or external communication are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard but carries a security risk when handling untrusted pickle files. No malware or obfuscation detected. The primary concern is the potential execution of arbitrary code during untrusted unpickling, which should be acknowledged in risk assessment.",
