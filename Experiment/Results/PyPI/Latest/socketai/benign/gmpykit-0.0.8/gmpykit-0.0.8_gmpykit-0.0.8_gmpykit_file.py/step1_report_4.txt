  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to read/write pickle and JSON files.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as function arguments, used in open() calls.",
  "sinks": "File reading and writing via open(), pickle.load(), pickle.dump(), json.load(), json.dumps().",
  "flows": "Input path -> open() -> read or write data -> return or finish.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code performs standard file I/O operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward functions to handle serialization/deserialization with pickle and JSON. It performs basic file extension checks and uses standard library functions for file access. No user input is directly sanitized or validated beyond file extension checks, but this does not pose an immediate security risk in this context. There is no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The functions do not execute untrusted code or interact with network resources. Overall, the code appears to be a simple utility module with normal behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains standard file I/O functions for handling pickle and JSON files without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No malware or security risks are evident.",
