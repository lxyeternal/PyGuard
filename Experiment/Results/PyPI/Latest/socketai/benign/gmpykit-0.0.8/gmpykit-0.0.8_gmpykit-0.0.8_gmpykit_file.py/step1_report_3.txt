  "sources": "File path input from function parameters; file opening functions.",
  "sinks": "pickle.load, pickle.dump, json.load, json.dumps, file write and read operations.",
  "flows": "Path parameters are used to open files, then data is read from or written to files via pickle or json functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Functions perform standard serialization/deserialization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple file I/O wrappers for pickle and JSON serialization. It checks for file extension and appends if missing, then opens, reads or writes data, and closes files. No user input is sanitized beyond file extension checks, but as it operates on file paths provided as parameters, no immediate risk of code injection or malicious data flow is apparent. The code uses standard Python libraries securely and does not execute or evaluate untrusted data dynamically. No obfuscation, malware, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for file serialization with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not handle untrusted data beyond basic file extension appending, and all operations are straightforward file I/O using trusted libraries.",
