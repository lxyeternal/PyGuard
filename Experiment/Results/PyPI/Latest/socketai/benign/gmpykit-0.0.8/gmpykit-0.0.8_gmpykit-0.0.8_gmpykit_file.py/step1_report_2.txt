  "sources": "File path input parameters in read_pickle, write_pickle, read_json, write_json functions.",
  "sinks": "File operations (open, read, write, close) for specified paths; pickle.load and pickle.dump for serialization.",
  "flows": "Input path -> open file -> load or dump data -> close file -> return data (for reads).",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle.load and pickle.dump without input validation or security measures, which can execute arbitrary code during unpickling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward file I/O functions with minimal processing. The use of pickle.load is a known security risk if untrusted pickle data is processed, as it can execute arbitrary code during unpickling. No input sanitization or validation is performed on the file paths. JSON functions appear safe, but the pickle functions pose a risk if used with untrusted files. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe for trusted data sources. However, the use of pickle.load and pickle.dump introduces security risks if untrusted data is processed, as unpickling can execute malicious code. No other malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
