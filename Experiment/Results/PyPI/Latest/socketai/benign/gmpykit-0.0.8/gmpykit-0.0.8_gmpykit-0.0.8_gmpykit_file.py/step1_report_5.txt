{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for reading and writing pickle and JSON files.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "File operations (open, read, write, close). No untrusted data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input file paths to file opening, data reading (pickle.load, json.load), and data writing (pickle.dump, json.dumps).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply performs standard file I/O operations for reading and writing pickle and JSON files. It appends file extensions if missing, then opens, processes, and closes files accordingly. There is no data manipulation beyond serialization/deserialization. No use of untrusted external inputs other than file paths, which are assumed to be provided by trusted sources. No network activity, code injection, or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for file handling. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
