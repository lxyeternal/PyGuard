{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for reading and writing pickle and JSON files.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as function arguments; potentially untrusted if paths are user-controlled.",
  "sinks": "Open file handles for reading/writing; pickle.load and pickle.dump for deserializing/serializing objects; json.load and json.dumps for JSON data.",
  "flows": "Input paths from arguments -> File open/read/write -> Deserialization/Serialization functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed. No network activity, no code injection, or data exfiltration routines present.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform standard file operations: opening files, reading/writing JSON and pickle data. The code does not execute or evaluate untrusted data; pickle load/dump can be risky if used with untrusted data, but here they are standard utility functions. No suspicious code patterns, no malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and typical for file handling. No backdoors, external communication, or data leaks evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard file handling utility functions for JSON and pickle files, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It handles file I/O in a typical manner without any suspicious operations.",
