  "purpose": "Utility functions for date conversions between Gregorian and Julian calendars, parsing date strings and tuples, and calculating days between dates.",
  "sources": "Input tuples, date strings, julian day numbers, environment variables (indirectly via pandas functions).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; internal calculations only.",
  "flows": "Input data (tuples, strings) processed through parsing functions, then converted via jdcal functions, with results used in date difference calculations.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward. Exception handling in parse functions is broad but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard date conversions and parsing using well-known libraries, with proper handling of missing data. No network, file, or system modifications are present. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. Exception handling is broad but acceptable for a utility module. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data leaks. The functions are designed for internal use, with no external data transmission or system impact.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard date utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The assessments and scores from the reports are consistent and justified.",
