  "purpose": "Filesystem-based cache management using pickle serialization and YAML configuration for metadata.",
  "sources": "Function arguments used to generate cache keys, filesystem reads/writes, pickle serialization, YAML config loading and saving.",
  "sinks": "Reading and writing cache files, updating cache metadata, deleting expired cache files.",
  "flows": "Function arguments -> cache key string -> filesystem filename; cache metadata -> YAML file -> cache expiration checks; pickle data -> cache files.",
  "anomalies": "No exception handling around file operations; no validation or sanitization of cache key components; use of pickle without validation; hardcoded cache paths.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard cache system with functions for reset, set path, cache data, load cache, check expiration, clean old caches, and a decorator for automatic caching. It uses pickle for serialization, which can be insecure if cache files are tampered with, but this is typical for such systems. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The main security concern is the potential for pickle exploitation and path manipulation via function arguments, but no evidence suggests malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and known risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign cache utility with no malicious activity. The security risk is low but present due to pickle usage and filesystem handling. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
