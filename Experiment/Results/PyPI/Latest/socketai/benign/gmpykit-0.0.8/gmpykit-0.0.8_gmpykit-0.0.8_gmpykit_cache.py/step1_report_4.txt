{
  "purpose": "This code implements a caching mechanism using pickle and YAML files, with functions to reset, set paths, add, load, and update cached content, as well as clean outdated caches. It also provides a decorator for caching function results.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily read from file system paths (checking existence, reading/writing pickle and YAML files). No external inputs like user input or network data are directly read.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include file system write operations (write_pickle, os.remove, yaml.dump), which could be exploited if file paths are manipulated or if the cache directory is accessible to an attacker.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking cache existence, reading cache config, updating cache if needed, and writing cache data back to disk. No external network communication or system commands are present.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. The code uses global paths, but these are set through provided functions and are not hardcoded. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward caching utility that stores serialized objects in a directory structure, with configuration stored in YAML. The functions perform typical cache management tasks, including checking age, updating, cleaning, and retrieving cache entries. The only notable aspect is reliance on filesystem paths and YAML serialization, which are standard. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, command execution, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard cache management utility with no malicious behavior or malware indicators. It handles files and cache metadata securely in a typical manner, with no evidence of sabotage or hidden malicious intent.",
