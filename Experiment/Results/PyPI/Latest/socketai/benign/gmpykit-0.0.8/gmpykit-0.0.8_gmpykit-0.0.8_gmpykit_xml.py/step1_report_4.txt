  "purpose": "Extracts text content from an XML string using lxml library",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'xml_text' string parameter",
  "sinks": "Returns extracted text; no direct untrusted data sinks evident",
  "flows": "Input 'xml_text' -> parsing with lxml -> converting to string -> output of text content",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'recover=True' in XMLParser, which allows parsing of malformed XML without errors; no apparent malicious code or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to parse XML input and extract text content. It uses lxml's 'XMLParser' with 'recover=True', which is common for handling malformed XML. The function does not include any hardcoded secrets, network calls, or code injection. It simply processes input data and outputs text content. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The use of 'recover=True' is a standard approach for resilient XML parsing, not an indicator of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward XML text extraction with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign utility function.",
