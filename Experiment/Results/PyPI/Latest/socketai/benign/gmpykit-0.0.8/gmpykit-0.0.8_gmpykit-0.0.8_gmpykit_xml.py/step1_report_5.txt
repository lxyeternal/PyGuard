  "purpose": "Extracts text content from an XML string using lxml's etree library.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'xml_text' which is a string containing XML data.",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks or security effects; the code processes data locally.",
  "flows": "Input 'xml_text' -> etree.fromstring() -> etree.tostring() -> decoded string return.",
  "anomalies": "Uses recover=True in XMLParser, which allows parsing of malformed XML but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports lxml.etree for XML processing. It defines a function to parse XML text into an element tree with recovery mode enabled. It then serializes the tree to a text-only string and decodes it to return. No external data is sent over networks, no malicious functions or obfuscation, and no dangerous operations are performed. Use of recover=True is for fault tolerance, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward XML text extraction utility without malicious intent or security risks. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, does not leak data externally, and contains no suspicious anomalies.",
