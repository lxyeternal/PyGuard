  "purpose": "Extracts text content from an XML string input using lxml's etree library.",
  "sources": "Reads XML data from the xml_text string parameter.",
  "sinks": "None directly; the function outputs text extracted from XML without executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input xml_text -> parse with etree.fromstring -> convert to text with etree.tostring -> decode to string",
  "anomalies": "Uses recover=True in the XMLParser, which can suppress parsing errors and potentially hide maliciously crafted XML payloads.",
  "analysis": "The function parses XML input and extracts all text content. The use of recover=True may mask malicious XML payloads that could exploit XML parsing vulnerabilities. No code injection, network calls, or data leaks are evident. The process is straightforward and uses standard library functions, with no obfuscated code or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard XML text extraction, with minimal risk. The use of recover=True is noted but does not inherently indicate malicious intent; it could, however, mask malformed or malicious XML. Overall, no malicious behavior is evident, but the recovery mode should be used cautiously in security-sensitive contexts.",
