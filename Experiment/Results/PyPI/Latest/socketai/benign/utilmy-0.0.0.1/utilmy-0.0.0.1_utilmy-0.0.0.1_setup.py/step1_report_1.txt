{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution via setuptools",
  "sources": "The entire code; primarily the setup() call and its parameters",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output occurs",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields, but this alone is not suspicious; no hardcoded credentials or secret data present",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and defines a package setup configuration with static metadata, including name, version, description, and classifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or suspicious constructs. The package metadata appears generic and non-malicious. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It simply defines package metadata for distribution, with no embedded malicious code or security risks.",
