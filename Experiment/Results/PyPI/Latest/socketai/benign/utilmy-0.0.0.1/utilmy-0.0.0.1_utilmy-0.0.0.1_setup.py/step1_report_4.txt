{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'utilmy' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters and the imported setuptools module.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data or untrusted input flows into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The version number '0.0.0.1' is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata such as name, version, author, and description. All fields are static strings with no user input, external data, or executable code. The versioning scheme is unconventional but harmless. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues. The package appears to be a placeholder with no embedded malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a placeholder package definition with no suspicious activity detected.",
