{
  "purpose": "To define the metadata and configuration for packaging a Python module named 'utilmy' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call, which reads no external input; static package metadata defined within the function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external inputs or perform actions beyond defining package metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only sets static metadata without data flows or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. All fields are typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging using setuptools. It defines basic package metadata with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or potentially malicious actions. The metadata fields are empty or contain placeholder values, which is typical for initial package scaffolding. No suspicious code or behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign and standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
