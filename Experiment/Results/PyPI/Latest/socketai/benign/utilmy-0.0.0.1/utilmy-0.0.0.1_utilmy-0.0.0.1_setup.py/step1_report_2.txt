  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'utilmy' using setuptools",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function parameters such as name, version, author, author_email, description, and classifiers",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no data flows to external systems or outputs",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets package metadata",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields; no suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with standard package metadata. The package description indicates it is a placeholder. No user input, external data sources, or dynamic code execution present. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for a placeholder Python package with no malicious intent or security issues.",
