  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports indicate that the code is primarily comments, license headers, and commented-out import statements.\n- The class 'Insert' is incomplete, with methods improperly indented or commented out.\n- No active code, data processing, or execution paths are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code appears to be a skeleton or in development, not functional or malicious.\n\n**Code confirmation:**\n- The actual code is inactive; all import statements are commented out.\n- The class and method definitions are incomplete or commented out.\n- There are no runtime behaviors, data flows, or outputs.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- The `_parameters_` method has incorrect indentation (likely a formatting error), but since it's commented out, it doesn't affect execution.\n- The code's structure suggests it's a stub or under development, not an active component.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the lack of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code being plain comments and commented-out code.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2; given the code's inactive state, this is reasonable, though some might argue 0 is more appropriate since there's no active logic.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports justify scores above 0.5; all are very low, reflecting the code's benign state.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are justified; the code is clearly inactive.\n- No evidence of supply chain compromise, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's inactive, comment-only nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no active logic, no malware, and no obfuscation.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9) reflect the reviewers' certainty that there's no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no active code, no security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code fragment is a non-functional, commented-out skeleton with standard licensing comments. It poses no security threat or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's state.",
