{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a larger project related to data sampling and transformations, likely for data processing or analysis within the akangatu framework.",
  "sources": "No active data input sources; the code only contains commented-out import statements and a class definition.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or output points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable within the provided code, as the critical parts are commented out and the class implementation is incomplete.",
  "anomalies": "All functional code is commented out; no executable logic present. The class method _parameters_ is improperly indented, which would cause syntax errors if uncommented.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of comments, including license and copyright notices, and commented-out import statements. There is an incomplete class definition with a method that is improperly indented. The code does not execute any operations, read inputs, or write outputs. Due to the lack of active code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The commented imports suggest dependencies on sampling and transformation modules, but these are inactive.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of comments and incomplete, inactive class definition. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. The improper indentation of the method indicates it would not run as-is, but this does not imply malicious intent.",
