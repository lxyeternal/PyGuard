{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a commented-out, incomplete class definition related to sampling and transformation, with no active logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "Commented-out import statements and class definitions; no active data input or external data reads.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or output points; code is inactive and does not process data.",
  "flows": "No data flows present; code is non-executable and contains only comments and incomplete class structures.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out import statements, incomplete method with indentation issues, and overall inactive state suggest a stub or under development, not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is entirely commented out or incomplete, with no active logic, data handling, or network operations. The commented imports and class suggest a development stub. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The indentation error in the method is a formatting issue, not an obfuscation or malicious indicator. The absence of runtime behavior and the benign comments support a conclusion of no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, inactive stub with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low security risk score (~0.1) and malware score of 0 are appropriate, reflecting its non-functional, development state.",
