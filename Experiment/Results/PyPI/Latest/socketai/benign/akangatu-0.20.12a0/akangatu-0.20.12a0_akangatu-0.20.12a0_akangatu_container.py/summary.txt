  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured framework component for data pipelines, with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities detected. The scores assigned in the reports—malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. Minor improvements could include replacing 'exit()' with exception raising for better robustness, but this does not affect security."
