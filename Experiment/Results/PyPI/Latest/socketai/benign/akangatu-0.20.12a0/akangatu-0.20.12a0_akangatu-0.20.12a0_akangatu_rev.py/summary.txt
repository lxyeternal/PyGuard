  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for data handling with no signs of malicious behavior. The main issue is the _process_ method's return value, which is likely a bug. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are appropriate, reflecting low security concern but acknowledging the logical flaw."
