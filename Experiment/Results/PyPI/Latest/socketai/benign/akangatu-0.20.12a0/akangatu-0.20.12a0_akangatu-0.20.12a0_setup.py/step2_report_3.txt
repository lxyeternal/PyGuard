  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, or network activity are present.\n- The code reads a local README.md file for the long description, which is standard practice.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The metadata and dependencies are static and typical.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup configuration.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, static data, no external data flow.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, no security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (very low, possibly accounting for the general nature of package setup).\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score seems appropriate given the code. Malware score is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar setup with metadata and dependencies.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, standard setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No untrusted data or suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- **Code review:** The code is a typical `setup.py` script with static metadata, reading a README file, and no dynamic or untrusted data sources.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; all reports agree.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; the only minor concern might be the inclusion of dependencies or metadata, but these are standard.\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, reflecting the inherent risk in package setup scripts, but nothing malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. The code is safe and legitimate.",
