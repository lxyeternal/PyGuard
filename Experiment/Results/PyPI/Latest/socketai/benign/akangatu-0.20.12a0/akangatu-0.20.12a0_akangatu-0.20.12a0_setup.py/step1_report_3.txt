  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the akangatu Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setuptools, static assignment of package metadata, and dependency lists.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "N/A – all operations are static configuration and file reading; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual constructs. The package setup appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of static metadata and setup instructions for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file for documentation, specifies dependencies, and sets package information. There are no dynamic code execution, user input processing, or network operations. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are evident. The code aligns with typical setup scripts for Python projects, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not process untrusted data, contain obfuscated code, or include suspicious behaviors. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
