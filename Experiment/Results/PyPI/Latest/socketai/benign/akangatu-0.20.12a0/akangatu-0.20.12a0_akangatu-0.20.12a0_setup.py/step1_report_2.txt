{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'akangatu' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; hardcoded metadata fields such as name, version, author, email, URL, license, classifiers, and requirements.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration points present in this script.",
  "flows": "N/A - the script primarily loads static metadata and dependencies without untrusted input flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden network activity. The code is straightforward setup logic with static fields.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It reads a local README.md file for description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery via setuptools. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets beyond package metadata, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It performs expected package setup tasks with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
