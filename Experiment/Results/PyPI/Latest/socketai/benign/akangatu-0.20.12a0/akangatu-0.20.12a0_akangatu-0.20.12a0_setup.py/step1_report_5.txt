  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the akangatu Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; static assignment of package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources; no data flows from external untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A — all data is static or file-based, with no external data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets beyond publicly available author email; no suspicious dynamic code, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file for long description and defines package metadata and dependencies. No user input, environment variables, or external untrusted data sources are used. No code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. No indications of malicious intent or backdoors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate, typical setup configuration for a Python package without malicious behavior. It does not contain any malware, suspicious code, or security risks.",
