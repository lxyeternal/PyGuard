  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'akangatu' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and reading the README for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, static metadata variables (NAME, VERSION, AUTHOR, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static data used for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional 'setup.py' script with static metadata, dependencies, and package configuration. It reads a local README.md file for description, with no dynamic or untrusted input, network activity, or obfuscated code. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code structure and content are standard, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
