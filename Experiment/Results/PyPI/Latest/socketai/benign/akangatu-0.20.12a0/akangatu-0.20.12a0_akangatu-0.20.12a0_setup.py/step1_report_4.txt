{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'akangatu' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, version info, author info, description, URLs, and dependencies from the script and README.md.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; primarily static data used for package setup.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static strings and file reads (README.md) into package configuration functions; no dynamic or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package configuration, reads the long description from a local README.md file, and defines package metadata such as name, version, author, dependencies, and URLs. No user input, network data, or dynamic code execution is present. The dependencies are static strings with no indication of malicious intent. All code appears standard for a Python setup script with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious or malicious operations.",
