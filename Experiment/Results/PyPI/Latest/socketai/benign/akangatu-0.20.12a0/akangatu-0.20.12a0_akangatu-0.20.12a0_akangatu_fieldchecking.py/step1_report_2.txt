{
  "purpose": "The code defines two classes, Forbid and Ensure, which are used to process data by either blocking data containing specific fields or ensuring certain fields are present.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the _process_ method, which accepts a data dictionary as an argument.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the print statement that outputs a message and the exit() call in the Forbid class; the raise Exception in the Ensure class also terminates execution if a condition is not met.",
  "flows": "Data is passed into _process_ methods; Forbid exits if a specific field is present, otherwise it returns data; Ensure raises an exception if a specific field is missing, otherwise it returns data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exit() in _process_ method of Forbid is abrupt and can be considered unsafe; no input sanitization, validation, or logging beyond print statements; code contains no hardcoded secrets or suspicious obfuscation; the overall code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code implements simple data validation steps, with classes designed to enforce rules on data dictionaries. The use of exit() in Forbid can be disruptive but not malicious. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration. The imports and class structure are standard, with no obfuscated or suspicious behavior. The code could be part of a larger data processing pipeline, but on its own, it does not exhibit malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It performs basic data validation, and the use of exit() could be considered a design choice rather than malicious activity. Overall, the package appears safe based on this fragment.",
