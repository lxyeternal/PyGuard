{
  "purpose": "Define two processing steps, 'Forbid' and 'Ensure', for data validation within a larger data processing pipeline.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the '_process_' methods which accept 'data' as a parameter.",
  "sinks": "The code potentially affects program flow through 'print' and 'exit()' in 'Forbid', and raises exceptions in 'Ensure', but these are typical control flow mechanisms and not malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into '_process_' methods, which perform checks and may terminate or raise errors based on conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of 'exit()' may be abrupt, but is contextually standard for validation steps.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes inheriting from 'asNoOp' and 'DIStep' intended for data validation. 'Forbid' terminates the process if a specified field exists in data, while 'Ensure' raises an exception if the field is missing. Both perform straightforward validation without any obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or hidden behaviors. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. Use of 'exit()' and exceptions are standard control mechanisms in validation contexts. No signs of supply chain sabotage or malware are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard validation logic with no malicious intent. It does not contain malware or security risks beyond typical control flow, which are appropriate for validation steps. There are no suspicious patterns or malicious code behaviors detected.",
