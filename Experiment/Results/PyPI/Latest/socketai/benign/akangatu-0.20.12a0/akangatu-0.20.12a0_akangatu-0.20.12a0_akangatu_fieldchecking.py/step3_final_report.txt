  "purpose": "Validation classes for data integrity: 'Forbid' prevents processing if a specific field exists; 'Ensure' enforces presence of a field.",
  "sources": "Data dictionary passed to '_process_' methods in both classes.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent or written elsewhere, only control flow is affected.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into '_process_' methods; 'Forbid' may terminate execution via 'exit()', 'Ensure' raises exceptions if conditions are not met.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exit()' in 'Forbid' is abrupt and could disrupt application flow, but not malicious; no obfuscation or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation checks with control flow termination in 'Forbid'. No malicious activity, backdoors, or network activity are present. The use of 'exit()' is unconventional but not malicious; it could be exploited to cause denial of service. No obfuscation or secrets are present. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) justified by the disruptive potential of 'exit()'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign validation logic with no malicious intent. The use of 'exit()' could be disruptive but is not malicious. The scores are appropriate; a slight increase in security risk score (to around 0.2) could better reflect the potential for disruption, but current values are justified.",
