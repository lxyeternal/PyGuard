  "purpose": "Class definitions for a data processing framework, involving abstract and container classes with minimal methods.",
  "sources": "Class inheritance and commented-out placeholder methods; no active input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows internally within class methods; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out methods and unused imports suggest incomplete features but no malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily class definitions with inheritance, minimal logic, and no active data handling or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. Commented-out code indicates placeholders or incomplete features, not malicious intent. The code's benign nature is consistent across multiple assessments, with no suspicious behavior or security vulnerabilities identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign framework component with no malicious or obfuscated features. The low security risk score (0.1) and malware score (0) are appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern. The assessments are accurate and justified.",
