  "conclusion": "The code is a flexible, dynamic placeholder framework intended for mocking, testing, or deferred evaluation. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. Its main security concern is potential misuse if malicious functions are injected, but this is not inherent to the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.4) is appropriate considering its dynamic capabilities."
