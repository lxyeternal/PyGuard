  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and potential security issues but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the observed patterns, indicating moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and complex control flow. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment."
