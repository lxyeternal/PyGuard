  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from stdin, environment variables, hardcoded secrets, dynamic imports, network connections.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variables, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (stdin, env vars) to processing functions, possibly leading to network/file sinks or dynamic eval/exec.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscation, complex control flow, dynamic imports, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and complex control flow, with potential insecure handling such as eval/exec and dynamic imports. No concrete malicious actions are confirmed, but the suspicious patterns and obfuscation suggest moderate concern. The malware score is set at 0.4, reflecting suspicion without definitive evidence. Obfuscation is high (0.7), and security risk is moderate (0.55). The code's structure and signals warrant cautious review but do not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and potential security issues but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the observed patterns, indicating moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and complex control flow. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment.",
