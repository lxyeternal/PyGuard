{
  "purpose": "Define a dynamic interface system for loading and instantiating implementations of a specified interface from a package.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module, pkgutil.iter_modules, signature from inspect, class attributes, function parameters, config_dict and kwargs",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input data directly leading to data leaks or code execution; dynamic import is a potential risk if inputs are malicious",
  "flows": "Input data from config_dict and kwargs is used to determine implementation and constructor parameters; dynamic import retrieves modules based on provided implementation names",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.import_module with implementation strings could be risky if input is untrusted, leading to malicious modules being loaded; however, the code properly handles exceptions and validates class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for dynamically loading and instantiating implementations based on configuration. It uses importlib to load modules and pkgutil to list available modules. The implementation name can be specified or defaulted. The code carefully handles exceptions, ensuring only subclasses of the interface are instantiated, and checks are in place for missing modules or classes. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The dynamic import based on user-provided implementation strings could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but the code validates module contents and types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dynamic interface loader with proper exception handling and validation. Although the use of dynamic import can be risky if misused, no malicious behavior or sabotage is evident. No malware signatures are detected. The main security concern is the potential for malicious module loading if untrusted input is supplied, but the code itself is not inherently malicious.",
