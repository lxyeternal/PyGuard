  "conclusion": "The code is a benign plugin loader that relies on dynamic imports, which can be risky if inputs are untrusted. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is supply chain or injection attacks via malicious modules if implementation names are manipulated. Proper validation and whitelisting of implementation identifiers are recommended to mitigate risks."
