  "purpose": "Provides a base class for dynamic interface implementation loading, instantiation, and listing available implementations.",
  "sources": "Reads module names from package directories, imports modules dynamically via importlib, accesses class attributes, and reads function signatures.",
  "sinks": "Dynamically imports modules and retrieves classes based on user-provided implementation names, which could be manipulated if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "User specifies implementation name → code imports module dynamically → retrieves class → creates class instance with parameters from config dict.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import of modules based on user input, which can be exploited if implementation names are untrusted. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No obfuscated code detected. The import process itself could potentially be misused if inputs are malicious, but the code does not contain malicious behaviors or sabotage.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports modules based on user-supplied implementation names and retrieves classes for instantiation. This approach poses potential security risks if inputs are not sanitized, as malicious modules or classes could be loaded, leading to remote code execution. However, there are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or signs of malware. The code does not perform any malicious activities such as data exfiltration or system compromise within this snippet. It relies on standard Python libraries and techniques for dynamic imports and reflection, which are common but require careful input validation in production. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is detected. The module importation based on untrusted input could be exploited in a supply chain attack, but the code itself is not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides dynamic interface implementation loading and instantiation functionality. It poses a potential security risk if the implementation names are supplied by untrusted sources, due to dynamic module importation. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected within this code segment. The overall security risk is low if inputs are validated; otherwise, it could be exploited for malicious module loading.",
