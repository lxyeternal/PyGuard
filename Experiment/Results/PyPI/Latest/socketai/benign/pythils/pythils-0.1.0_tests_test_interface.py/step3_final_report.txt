  "purpose": "Unit testing suite for the DynamicInterface class, verifying implementation retrieval, class instantiation, parameter parsing, and error handling using mocking.",
  "sources": "Mocked module imports and class definitions within the test setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data sinks; all data is controlled within the test environment.",
  "flows": "Mocked module imports lead to class instantiations and method calls within the test scope, with no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; mocking is confined to the test environment, with no malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a controlled, standard unit testing suite employing mocking to simulate module and class behaviors. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute malicious code. The extensive use of mocking and patching is typical for testing environments and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or security flaws are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated content. It functions solely as a testing suite employing mocks to verify class loading and instantiation logic. The scores are justified and should remain unchanged.",
