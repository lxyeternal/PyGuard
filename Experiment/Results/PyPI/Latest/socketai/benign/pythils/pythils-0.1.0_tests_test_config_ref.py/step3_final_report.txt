  "purpose": "Unit tests for ConfigRef and ConfigDict classes to verify their behavior and methods.",
  "sources": "In-memory configuration objects and class methods within the test cases.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or untrusted input is involved.",
  "flows": "The tests operate on internal objects and verify method outputs without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for configuration classes, performing internal assertions on initialization, string representation, relative key detection, and value retrieval with defaults. It involves no external data sources, network activity, or malicious logic. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for testing purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as standard unit tests for configuration classes. There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
