  "purpose": "Provides configuration management, including loading from environment variables, files, and in-memory dictionaries, with dynamic module importation capabilities.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, loading configuration files (.yaml, .json, .py), and importing Python modules via importlib.util.",
  "sinks": "Execution of Python code during importlib.util.spec_from_file_location and spec.loader.exec_module, which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "from_file method loads a Python file, creates a module spec, and executes it, potentially executing malicious code if the file is untrusted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.util to load and execute external Python files without sanitization or sandboxing; no obfuscation or hidden code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code allows dynamic loading of configuration data from various sources, including executing external Python scripts via importlib.util. While the code itself is benign and straightforward, the use of importlib.util to load and execute arbitrary Python files introduces a significant security risk if untrusted files are provided. No malicious payloads are embedded, and the code structure is clear, with no obfuscation. The primary concern is the potential for malicious code execution during the import process, which could lead to system compromise if exploited. The malware score should reflect the high potential for malicious activity if misused, and the security risk score should be high accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "The static code does not contain malicious payloads, but the capability to execute arbitrary Python code via importlib.util makes it a high-risk feature if used with untrusted files. The malware score should be set close to 1 due to this potential, and the overall security risk should be similarly high. The code is not obfuscated, and the risk stems from its design allowing execution of external code, which could be exploited maliciously.",
