  "conclusion": "The static code does not contain malicious payloads, but the capability to execute arbitrary Python code via importlib.util makes it a high-risk feature if used with untrusted files. The malware score should be set close to 1 due to this potential, and the overall security risk should be similarly high. The code is not obfuscated, and the risk stems from its design allowing execution of external code, which could be exploited maliciously."
