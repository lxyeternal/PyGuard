      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and potential security issues but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the observed patterns, indicating moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and complex control flow. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code is a flexible, dynamic placeholder framework intended for mocking, testing, or deferred evaluation. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. Its main security concern is potential misuse if malicious functions are injected, but this is not inherent to the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.4) is appropriate considering its dynamic capabilities."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The static code does not contain malicious payloads, but the capability to execute arbitrary Python code via importlib.util makes it a high-risk feature if used with untrusted files. The malware score should be set close to 1 due to this potential, and the overall security risk should be similarly high. The code is not obfuscated, and the risk stems from its design allowing execution of external code, which could be exploited maliciously."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign plugin loader that relies on dynamic imports, which can be risky if inputs are untrusted. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is supply chain or injection attacks via malicious modules if implementation names are manipulated. Proper validation and whitelisting of implementation identifiers are recommended to mitigate risks."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing configuration class behaviors. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The current assessment of malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) is appropriate. The overall security posture is very low risk, and the code can be considered safe for use."
