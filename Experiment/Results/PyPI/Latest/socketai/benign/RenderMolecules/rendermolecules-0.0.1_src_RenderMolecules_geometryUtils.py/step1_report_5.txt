{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for 3D rotation matrix calculation, angle measurement between vectors, and object translation in 3D space.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, specifically 'axis', 'theta', 'vector1', 'vector2', and 'displacementVector'. Uses 'object.location' as input data.",
  "sinks": "Performs mathematical operations that do not directly lead to data leaks or system effects. The 'translateObject' function modifies 'object.location' directly.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to compute matrices and angles; 'translateObject' updates the 'location' attribute of an object based on a displacement vector.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The functions perform standard mathematical operations related to 3D transformations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard 3D mathematical functions: rotation matrix computation, angle calculation between vectors, and object translation. It does not include any network activity, system modification outside of object attributes, or hidden behaviors. The code appears to be a typical utility for 3D transformations without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of 3D vector mathematics and object translation. No malicious behavior, malware, or suspicious anomalies detected. It is likely a utility module for 3D spatial calculations.",
