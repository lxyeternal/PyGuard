  "purpose": "Provide functions for 3D rotation matrix calculation, angle between vectors, and translation of an object in 3D space.",
  "sources": "np.asarray, np.dot, np.sqrt, np.cos, np.sin, np.cross, np.linalg.norm, np.arccos, object.location",
  "sinks": "object.location attributes being modified in translateObject",
  "flows": "Input vectors or parameters to functions; rotation_matrix and angle_between produce numerical outputs; translateObject modifies object.location based on displacementVector",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns observed; functions perform standard mathematical operations. The only potential concern is the modification of object.location, which could be misused if the object parameter is malicious or externally controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions: rotation_matrix creates a rotation matrix around a specified axis; angle_between computes the angle in degrees between two vectors; translateObject updates the location attribute of an object by adding a displacement vector. All operations are standard mathematical calculations, with no external data sources, network operations, or suspicious code. The translateObject function modifies object attributes directly, which is typical for 3D object manipulation, but could be exploited if the object parameter is maliciously controlled. There are no signs of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements common mathematical functions for 3D transformations and object translation. There are no indications of malicious intent or malware. The main security consideration is ensuring the 'object' parameter in translateObject is from a trusted source to prevent unauthorized modifications.",
