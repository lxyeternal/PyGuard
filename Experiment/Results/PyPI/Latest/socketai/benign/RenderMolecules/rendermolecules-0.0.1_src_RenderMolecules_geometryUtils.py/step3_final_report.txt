{
  "purpose": "Provides 3D geometric transformations including rotation matrices, angle calculations, and object translation.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters: 'axis', 'theta', 'vector1', 'vector2', and 'object.location'.",
  "sinks": "Modifies 'object.location' attribute directly in translateObject.",
  "flows": "Input vectors and parameters flow into mathematical functions; 'object.location' is updated directly in translateObject.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard numpy operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard 3D transformation functions with proper use of numpy. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The direct mutation of 'object.location' is typical in 3D manipulation but could be risky if 'object' is maliciously controlled; however, this is common in such utilities. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscation as 0, and security risk as very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for 3D transformations with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, assuming trusted input objects. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
