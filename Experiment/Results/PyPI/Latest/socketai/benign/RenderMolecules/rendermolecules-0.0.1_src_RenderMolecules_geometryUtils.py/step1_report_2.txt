{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for 3D geometric transformations, specifically rotation matrices, calculating angles between vectors, and translating an object in 3D space.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'axis', 'theta', 'vector1', 'vector2', and 'displacementVector' parameters, as well as 'object.location'.",
  "sinks": "The code updates the 'location' attribute of an 'object' by modifying its x, y, and z coordinates.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('axis', 'theta', 'vector1', 'vector2', 'displacementVector') are used to compute transformation matrices or angles, and then 'object.location' is modified based on 'displacementVector'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or unusual code patterns are present. The functions appear standard for geometric operations without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions: 'rotation_matrix' computes a rotation matrix for a given axis and angle, with standard math and numpy functions; 'angle_between' calculates the angle between two vectors, normalizing inputs and handling parallel vectors; 'translateObject' modifies the 'location' attribute of an 'object' based on a provided displacement vector. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. Usage of numpy is standard, and the code structure is straightforward. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform common 3D geometric transformations without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It operates solely on provided inputs and modifies object location accordingly. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
