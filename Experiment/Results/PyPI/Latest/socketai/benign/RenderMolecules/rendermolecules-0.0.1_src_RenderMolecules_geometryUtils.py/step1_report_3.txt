{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for 3D geometric transformations, including rotation matrices, angle calculations between vectors, and translation of objects in 3D space.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: 'axis', 'theta', 'vector1', 'vector2', 'displacementVector', and 'object.location'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the modification of 'object.location' properties, which could alter the position of 3D objects within a scene or application.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs ('axis', 'vector1', 'vector2', 'displacementVector', 'object') to computations in functions; the 'translateObject' modifies 'object.location' based on 'displacementVector'.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'translateObject' modifies 'object.location' directly without returning a value; this is typical but could be risky if 'object' is not properly validated. The code appears standard for 3D transformations; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard mathematical functions for 3D rotations and vector operations using numpy. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present. The direct modification of 'object.location' could be a concern if used maliciously, but as is, it simply updates object position. There are no indications of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious behavior. The functions are typical for 3D computational tasks. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of 3D geometric transformations, with no malicious intent. It could be part of a larger 3D application or simulation. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks identified based on this snippet alone.",
