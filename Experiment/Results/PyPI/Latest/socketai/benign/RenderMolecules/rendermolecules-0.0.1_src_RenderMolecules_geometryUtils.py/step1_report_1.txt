{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for 3D geometric transformations, including rotation matrices, angle calculations, and translation of objects in space.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters: axis, theta, vector1, vector2, object, and displacementVector.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the 'location' attribute of an 'object', potentially affecting external or external-like objects, but no data is sent outside or externalized explicitly.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (axis, vectors, displacement) are used to compute transformations; the translateObject function updates object.location based on displacementVector.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'translateObject' directly mutates the 'location' attribute of an object without validation, but no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. No dynamic execution or obfuscation is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mathematical functions for 3D rotations and angles using numpy, and a translation function that modifies an object's location. No external data inputs, network operations, or hidden behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and mathematically focused, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of 3D transformation utilities with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply performs geometric calculations and object translation, typical of graphics or simulation code.",
