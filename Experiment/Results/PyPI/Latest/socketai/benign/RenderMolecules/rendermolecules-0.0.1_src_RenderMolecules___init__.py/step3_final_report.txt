  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, user input, potential system command executions, network/file operations, dynamic code execution functions.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network requests, environment variables, file I/O, dynamic eval/exec calls.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) to sinks (system commands, network, eval/exec).",
  "anomalies": "Potential untrusted input handling, use of environment variables, possible dynamic code execution, absence of explicit malicious code but patterns that could be exploited.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the presence or absence of code, suspicious patterns, and assign scores consistent with their descriptions. Reports with no code or benign code appropriately assign zero malware and obfuscation scores, with low risk scores reflecting minimal concern. Reports noting input handling or environment variable usage assign moderate risk (0.2-0.3), justified by potential misuse if inputs are untrusted. Confidence levels align with the amount of information; no overestimations are evident. The assessments are cautious and evidence-based, avoiding false positives.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are generally accurate and consistent with their descriptions. No evidence of malicious code or obfuscation is present. The moderate risk scores are justified given the patterns of input handling and potential command execution. Overall, the scores and conclusions are appropriate; no significant revisions are necessary.",
