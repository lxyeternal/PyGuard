{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for creating, modifying, and managing Blender scene objects, materials, and settings, including external file import and scene cleanup.",
  "sources": "External files loaded via loadPLY(), user input for object creation functions, environment variables for scene settings.",
  "sinks": "Loading external files (loadPLY), object deletion (deleteAllObjects), scene modifications.",
  "flows": "External file paths from loadPLY() to object creation and material assignment; user inputs to object parameters; scene settings to rendering outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; straightforward API usage; no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Blender utility module, with functions for object creation, scene management, and file import. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. External file loading via loadPLY could be exploited if untrusted files are used, but this is common in Blender workflows. The deleteAllObjects() function could be misused but is not malicious. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system commands. Malware scores are 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and security risk scores are low (~0.2) due to external file handling potential. Overall, the code appears benign and consistent with typical Blender scripting practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Blender utility script with no malicious intent. The minimal security concern stems from external file loading, which is standard in such workflows. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
