  "purpose": "Utility functions for color conversion (hex to RGB with gamma correction) and string searching within lists using a unique separator.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as hexcode strings, listOfStrings, stringToFind, start/end indices.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; internal functions process data without external interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through conversion and search functions; no external data or system calls involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of numpy.ndarray with dtype=list is unconventional and inefficient but not malicious; string joining with a fixed separator is unusual but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides benign utility functions for color conversion and string searching. No network, file, or system interactions are present. The numpy array usage and string joining are unconventional but do not introduce security risks. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are detected. The functions operate solely on input data, with no side effects or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated≈0.2, risk≈0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with minor inefficiencies and unconventional practices that do not indicate malicious intent or supply chain attack. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
