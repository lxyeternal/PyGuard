{
  "purpose": "Provides functions and data related to chemical elements, including atomic numbers, element lists, atomic weights, van der Waals radii, bond lengths, and conversion constants.",
  "sources": "Reads from predefined data structures: 'elementList', 'manifest', 'elementMass', 'vdwRadii', 'bondLengths', and various constants.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted input; functions mainly access static lists and dictionaries without external data or output to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input 'atomicNumber' and 'element' are used to access static lists/dictionaries; no external or untrusted data flows or manipulations are observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present. All data appears static and directly assigned.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static lists and dictionaries for chemical element data, conversion constants, and physical parameters. The functions 'getElementFromAtomicNumber' and 'getAtomicNumberFromElement' perform basic list lookups with exception handling. There are no external inputs, network connections, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation, are present. The purpose appears purely scientific and educational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of static data access functions for chemical elements with no malicious intent. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.",
