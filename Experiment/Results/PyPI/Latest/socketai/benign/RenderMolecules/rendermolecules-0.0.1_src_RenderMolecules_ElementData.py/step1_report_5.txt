  "purpose": "The code provides functions for retrieving chemical element information based on atomic number or element symbol, along with related constants and data for chemical and physical properties.",
  "sources": "Element list, manifest dictionary, elementMass list, vdwRadii list, bondLengths dictionary, and various constants.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data is used in a potentially dangerous way. No network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "The functions read data from predefined lists and dictionaries; no untrusted input flows into sensitive operations or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. Exception handling raises errors with messages, but no malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs data lookups and returns information about elements and physical constants. It includes no dynamic code execution, network access, or system modifications. Exception handling uses ValueError with messages, but these are standard error reporting. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The data appears static and well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data module for chemical element information and physical constants. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It appears safe and purely informational.",
