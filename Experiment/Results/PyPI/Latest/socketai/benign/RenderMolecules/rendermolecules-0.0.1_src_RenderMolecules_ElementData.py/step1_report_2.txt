{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and data structures related to chemical elements, atomic numbers, atomic masses, Van der Waals radii, and bond lengths, likely for visualization or molecular modeling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as 'atomicNumber' and 'element' from function arguments. It also accesses the global variables 'elementList' and 'elementMass'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks are present where untrusted data is used to cause data leaks or system effects; the code primarily processes data internally.",
  "flows": "Input 'atomicNumber' or 'element' flows through the functions to access data from lists, with no external output or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The data structures contain static scientific data, which is typical for such modules.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for converting between atomic numbers and element symbols using list indexing, with basic exception handling. It maintains static data about elements, their masses, Van der Waals radii, bond lengths, and conversion constants. No dynamic or external data sources are used. There are no indicators of malicious intent, code injection, or data leakage. The exception handling appears standard, and no hidden or obfuscated behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a straightforward scientific utility code providing chemical and physical data for molecular modeling or visualization. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. All data is static and internally used, with no network or file operations that could be exploited.",
