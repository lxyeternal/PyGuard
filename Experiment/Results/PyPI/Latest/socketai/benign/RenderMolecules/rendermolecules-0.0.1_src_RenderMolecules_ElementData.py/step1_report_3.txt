{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and data structures for retrieving chemical element information and physical constants related to atomic properties and molecular modeling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from predefined lists and dictionaries such as elementList, elementMass, vdwRadii, bondLengths, and the manifest dictionary.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input directly; the functions raise exceptions on invalid data but do not handle external untrusted input or write data to external sources.",
  "flows": "The functions getElementFromAtomicNumber and getAtomicNumberFromElement read from elementList and process an input parameter, then return data based on list indexing or search operations. No external data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation is present. The code contains standard data definitions and straightforward functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple data structures for element properties, including lists and dictionaries, and two functions for converting between atomic numbers and element symbols. Exception handling is used to manage invalid inputs, but there are no external data sources, network operations, or code execution features. The data appears to be static and related solely to chemical information and physical constants. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The code's design is typical for scientific computing and data management in chemical modeling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward collection of static data and simple functions for chemical element data retrieval. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for scientific calculations.",
