  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between atomic number and element symbol, and static data related to chemical elements and physical constants.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded lists and dictionaries within the code, such as elementList, elementMass, vdwRadii, bondLengths, and constants.",
  "sinks": "No external data input or output; no network or file operations; data is static.",
  "flows": "N/A – static data access and simple list/index operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple, static data structures and functions performing list indexing and searching with exception handling. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. Exception handling is standard, raising ValueError with messages. The data is hardcoded, typical for scientific constants, and used for lookup purposes. No suspicious patterns, malicious behaviors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The functions are utility in nature, with no external dependencies or data flows that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended for scientific or educational purposes. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and very low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
