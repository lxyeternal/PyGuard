{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to convert between atomic numbers and element symbols, and contains data related to chemical elements, molecular bonds, and physical constants.",
  "sources": "The data structures such as elementList, elementMass, vdwRadii, bondLengths, and manifest are hardcoded constants initialized within the script.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data sources or input/output streams are present that could lead to data leakage or injection.",
  "flows": "The functions convert atomic numbers to element symbols and vice versa, using predefined lists and handling exceptions internally. No external data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden code paths. All code is straightforward and clearly structured.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to be a standard utility module for atomic and molecular data with functions to retrieve element information based on atomic number or symbol. It relies solely on predefined, hardcoded constants and simple list/index operations. Exception handling is properly used to manage invalid inputs. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The constants related to physics and chemistry are common and do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data and utility module related to chemical and physical constants. It contains no malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for use as part of larger scientific or educational applications.",
