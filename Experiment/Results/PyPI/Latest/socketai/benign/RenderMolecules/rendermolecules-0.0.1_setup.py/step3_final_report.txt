  "purpose": "Standard setup script for Python package distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import statements from setuptools; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; setup() is called with no parameters and no data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions from setuptools and calls setup() within the main guard without arguments. It does not include any dynamic behavior, external data, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, standard setup script. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments to scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
