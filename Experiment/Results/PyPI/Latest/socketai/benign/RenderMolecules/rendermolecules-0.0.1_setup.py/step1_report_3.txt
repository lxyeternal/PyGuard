{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up and package a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports and calls setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or sensitive information handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply executes setup() when run as main.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard, and lacks any suspicious or unusual constructs or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools and invokes setup() if the script is run directly. It is a typical setup script with no hidden or malicious code, no external data handling, and no suspicious logic. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent. The simplicity and standard pattern suggest it is legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
