{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules 'setuptools' and 'find_packages', which are standard for packaging, and the 'setup()' function called in the main block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs are processed; the 'setup()' function is called without parameters, so no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: imports modules, then executes 'setup()' when run as a script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls 'setup()' in the main block. Since no parameters are passed to 'setup()', the script relies on configuration via setup.cfg or other external files. There are no sources of untrusted data, no suspicious behaviors, and no malicious code. The simplicity indicates this is a standard package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs a standard package setup operation without any suspicious behavior.",
