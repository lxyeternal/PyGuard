{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports modules and executes setup() if run as the main program.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and invokes 'setup()' within a main guard, which is standard for packaging scripts. There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, or network operations. It performs a basic package setup without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign packaging script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
