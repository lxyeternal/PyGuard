{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators for permission checks and applies them to functions to control access based on permission classes.",
  "sources": "Permission classes (PermissionCheckerA, PermissionCheckerB) and decorator functions (edit, create, delete, function) imported from an external module.",
  "sinks": "Decorator application and function calls, especially the permission checks within decorators (assumed to instantiate or evaluate permission classes).",
  "flows": "Decorators evaluate permission classes or instances during function decoration; permission attributes determine if functions execute or return None.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection detected. Use of external decorator functions might be obfuscated, but no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines permission classes with boolean attributes. Decorators are applied to functions, which check these permissions at runtime, potentially preventing function execution if permissions are insufficient. No evident malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling is present. The imported decorator functions' internal behavior isn't visible, but their usage appears to be standard permission checking. The overall structure is straightforward and safe, with no signs of code injection, data leaks, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements permission-based access control using decorators and permission classes. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are apparent. The code is benign and follows standard permission check patterns.",
