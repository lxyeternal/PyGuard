  "purpose": "The code defines permission checker classes and uses decorators to enforce permission checks on functions related to edit, create, delete operations, and a generic function wrapper.",
  "sources": "PermissionCheckerA and PermissionCheckerB class constructors, decorator functions (@edit, @create, @delete, @function), and their parameters.",
  "sinks": "Decorator application points, where permissions are enforced, and the execution of decorated functions.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation -> decorator invocation -> permission check -> function execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Decorators instantiate classes dynamically, but this is standard practice. No obfuscated code or unusual logic. No suspicious network or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines permission classes with specific permission flags. Decorators are applied to functions to control their execution based on permissions, passing class objects or instances. The permission checks are likely handled within imported decorator functions. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No suspicious logic or anomalous behavior. The functions perform simple print and return operations, with permission logic abstracted away. Overall, the code appears to be a permission management utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a permission control setup using decorators, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard implementation of permission checks without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
