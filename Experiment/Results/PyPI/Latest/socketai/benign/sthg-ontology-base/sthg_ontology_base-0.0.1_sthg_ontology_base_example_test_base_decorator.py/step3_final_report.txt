  "purpose": "Defines permission classes with boolean flags and applies decorators for permission checks on functions.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, decorator applications, imported decorators from external module.",
  "sinks": "Decorator functions wrapping target functions, potentially controlling execution based on permissions.",
  "flows": "Decorator invocation with class types or instances, permission attributes checked within decorators, functions executed if permissions pass.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed; straightforward permission pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple permission enforcement mechanism using decorators and permission classes. No malicious code, data leaks, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The imported decorators are assumed to perform standard permission checks. The functions are benign, performing print and return statements. All signals indicate benign, standard permission control without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign permission enforcement pattern with no signs of malicious activity or security threats. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1) are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
