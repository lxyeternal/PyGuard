{
  "purpose": "The code defines permission checkers and applies decorators for permission-based operation execution, along with a test function to demonstrate usage.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'sthg_ontology_base.utils.base_decorator', class constructors, decorator applications, and function calls.",
  "sinks": "None directly visible; no untrusted data handling or output is evident that could lead to data leakage or system effects.",
  "flows": "Decorators invoke permission checkers; function calls are executed after permission checks, but no malicious data flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious logic, or malicious code. Use of decorators for permission checks appears standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports decorators and permission classes, then applies these decorators to functions to enforce permission logic. The permission classes have predefined access rights. The decorator usage suggests dynamic permission verification. The functions themselves are simple print statements and returns. No system commands, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. The overall structure seems consistent with permission enforcement without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to implement permission-based function execution using decorators and permission classes without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security threats or malware are evident.",
