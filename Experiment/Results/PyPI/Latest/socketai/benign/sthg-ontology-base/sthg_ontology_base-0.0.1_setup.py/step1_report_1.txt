{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'sthg_ontology_base', specifying its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version, author, URL, description), and dependencies from 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data is used in a harmful way; no network or system calls based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows or untrusted input handling; the setup parameters are static.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'setuptools' to configure package setup with static metadata and dependencies. All data is hardcoded and typical for Python package setup scripts. No user input, network connections, or dynamic code execution is present. Dependencies are standard Python packages without signs of malicious intent. No suspicious or anomalous patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains only package metadata and dependency declarations, all statically defined.",
