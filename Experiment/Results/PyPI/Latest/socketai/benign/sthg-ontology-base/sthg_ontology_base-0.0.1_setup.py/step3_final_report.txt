  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or dynamic input; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; all data is hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior; commented code is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with static data, no dynamic execution, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code. All dependencies are standard, and no untrusted input is processed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, except the minor security risk score of 0.1 in report 5, which is unwarranted given the benign nature of the code.",
