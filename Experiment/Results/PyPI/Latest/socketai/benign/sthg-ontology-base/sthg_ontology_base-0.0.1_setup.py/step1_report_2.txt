  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging the 'sthg_ontology_base' Python library, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Code reads package metadata (name, version, author, description), dependency list, and package discovery patterns.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; dependencies are static strings, and no user input or untrusted data sources are processed.",
  "flows": "N/A - No dynamic data flow or untrusted data paths present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code; commented-out lines are benign.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. All data appears static and typical for package setup scripts. No code execution, network activity, or input handling is present. The dependencies are standard Python packages with version constraints. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
