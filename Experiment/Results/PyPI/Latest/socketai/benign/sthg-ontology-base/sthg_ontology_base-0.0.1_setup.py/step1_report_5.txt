  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package 'sthg_ontology_base' including package discovery and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata (name, version, author, URL), and dependencies list ('install_requires').",
  "sinks": "Dependencies are installed, and metadata is processed; no direct sink for untrusted input is present.",
  "flows": "Metadata is used during package installation; dependencies are fetched from external repositories.",
  "anomalies": "Commented out code for reading 'long_description' from a file; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script with typical package metadata and dependencies. No code injection, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are detected. The dependencies are standard database libraries, and no untrusted data sources or malicious code behaviors are present. Commented-out code for reading long description from a file is typical and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a conventional setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appears safe and standard for package distribution.",
