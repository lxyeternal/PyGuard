  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration script for packaging a Python project named 'sthg_ontology_base'.",
  "sources": "Reads project metadata from hardcoded strings and package dependencies from a list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow paths identified; data flows from static strings into setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are detected. No code execution, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static project metadata and dependency lists. Dependencies are specified in a list with version constraints. There are no input sources, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscated elements. Comments and code structure are straightforward, typical of a package setup script. All data is static and directly assigned; no user input or untrusted data is processed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code, malware, or suspicious patterns.",
