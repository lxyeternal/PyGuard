  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for standard data processing or utility functions, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function inputs, environment variables, and possibly files (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or environment variable manipulations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/env) to sinks (network, files, env), if present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are detected. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows standard use of functions, variables, and data handling. No code segments indicate malicious activities such as system command execution, data exfiltration, or network communication with suspicious domains. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious dynamic execution is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It appears to be a typical, benign Python script. The confidence level is high given the absence of suspicious patterns.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
