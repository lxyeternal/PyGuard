  "purpose": "Analyze the open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, anomalies, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "Input data read from environment variables, network connections, file reads, and user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, and potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or network inputs to sinks like network sockets or file system writes, possibly via intermediate processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs; in this case, minimal anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears standard with no evidence of malicious payloads or obfuscation. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are observed. The code's complexity is typical, and no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system damage, or unauthorized access is evident. Confidence in benign nature is high (0.9). The minimal obfuscation score (0.2) in one report is justified by slight complexity but not malicious intent. Security risk remains low (0.2). The overall assessment indicates the code is safe, with no active threats or sabotage present.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code is benign, with no malicious activity or sabotage detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
