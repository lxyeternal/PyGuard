  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports identify the hardcoded password \"Dev@02891\" in the `init_database()` function as a security concern.\n- None of the reports find evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or malware.\n- The code appears to be standard ORM setup and CRUD testing scripts.\n- The main risk identified is insecure credential storage, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard database setup and CRUD operations.\n- **Sources:** Reads hardcoded password, imports external modules.\n- **Sinks:** Uses password for DB connection.\n- **Flow:** Clear, straightforward.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just insecure credential handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, only security concern due to hardcoded password.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.4 (reasonable, given the insecure credential)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- Similar content, emphasizes insecure credential storage.\n- No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.4\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Same observations, focuses on the standard ORM and CRUD functions.\n- No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.4\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Mentions potential injection risk but clarifies ORM parameterization mitigates this.\n- Highlights insecure credentials but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.3 (slightly lower, reflecting less concern about credential exposure versus active malicious behavior)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Similar to others, no malicious activity.\n- Main concern is insecure credential storage.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.3\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious data flow.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.3 to 0.4, reflecting security concerns due to hardcoded credentials but not active malicious intent.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- Given the repeated pattern of insecure credential handling, a **risk score of 0.4** across most reports is justified.\n- Since no malicious activity is detected, malware remains at 0.\n- Obfuscation remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.4 (due to insecure credential storage, which is a security vulnerability but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the main security concern (hardcoded password) but do not attribute malicious intent or activity. The assigned scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. No significant changes are necessary.",
