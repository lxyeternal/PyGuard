  "purpose": "Provides database models, connection setup, and CRUD operation tests for an ORM-based Python application.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded password in init_database(), imports external modules, reads input from database functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses the hardcoded password for database connection; no other untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input (hardcoded password) flows into database connection string; CRUD functions operate on database models without external untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials ('Dev@02891') in the code; no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines ORM models and performs standard CRUD operations via a custom client. The main security concern is the hardcoded password, which could lead to credential exposure. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward. The security risk score is around 0.4, reflecting the insecure credential handling but no active malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical database interaction script with insecure credential handling. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack. The primary security concern is the hardcoded password, which warrants remediation but does not constitute malware or malicious behavior.",
