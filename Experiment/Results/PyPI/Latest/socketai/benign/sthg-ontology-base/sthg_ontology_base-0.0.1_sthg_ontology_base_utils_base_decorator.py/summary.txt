  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for permission validation and source code inspection. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The main security consideration is the potential leakage of source code via inspect.getsource, which is a known utility feature but not malicious. The permission class instantiation could have side effects if classes are untrusted, but this is a design consideration rather than a security flaw. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
