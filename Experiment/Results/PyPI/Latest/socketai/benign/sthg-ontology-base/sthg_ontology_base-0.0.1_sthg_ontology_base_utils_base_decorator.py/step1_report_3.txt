  "purpose": "Provide decorators for source code inspection and permission checks.",
  "sources": "inspect.getsource() function to retrieve source code of a function.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks, code execution, or external communication.",
  "flows": "The source function supplies code for inspection; no flow to external systems or untrusted data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code primarily defines decorators and a utility function.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'function' decorator that returns source code of a given function, which is a legitimate use of the inspect module. The permission decorators ('edit', 'create', 'delete') validate permissions by checking attributes or instantiating classes; they print messages and return None if checks fail. All behaviors are standard for permission validation; no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious actions are evident. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activities. The code structure and functions are straightforward and align with typical permission handling patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility and permission-checking decorators with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical in context of permission validation logic.",
