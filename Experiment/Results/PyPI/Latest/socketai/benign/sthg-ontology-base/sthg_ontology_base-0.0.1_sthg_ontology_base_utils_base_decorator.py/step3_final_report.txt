{
  "purpose": "Provides decorators for permission validation (edit, create, delete) that instantiate permission checker classes if provided as types and verify specific attributes; also includes a function decorator that returns the source code of the decorated function using inspect.getsource.",
  "sources": "The function decorator uses inspect.getsource to retrieve source code; permission decorators instantiate classes or use objects to check attributes like is_edit, is_create, is_delete.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or system effects; no network, file, or environment variable operations; source code exposure via inspect.getsource is a potential information leak if misused.",
  "flows": "The function decorator retrieves source code of a function; permission decorators instantiate checker classes and verify attributes; permission checks flow from the decorator to the permission checker objects/classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.getsource to expose function source code; instantiation of classes during permission checks which could invoke constructors with side effects; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility decorators for permission validation and source code inspection. The source code exposure via inspect.getsource can leak sensitive information but is a known feature. Instantiating classes during permission checks could execute side effects if constructors are malicious or have unintended behavior, but this is standard practice assuming trusted classes. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature, with the main concern being potential information leakage. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no active malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for permission validation and source code inspection. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The main security consideration is the potential leakage of source code via inspect.getsource, which is a known utility feature but not malicious. The permission class instantiation could have side effects if classes are untrusted, but this is a design consideration rather than a security flaw. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
