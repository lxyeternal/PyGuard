{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators for permission checking and a utility to retrieve source code of functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources are the functions and permission checker objects passed as arguments to decorators.",
  "targets": "Potential targets include the console output (print statements) and returned source code strings.",
  "flows": "The decorators process permission checkers and functions; source code is retrieved via inspect.getsource.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior detected. The print statements are standard for permission denial messages.",
  "analysis": "The code defines decorators for permission validation, which instantiate checker objects if they are classes and check for specific attributes. The inspect module is used to extract source code from functions. There are no data leaks, code injections, or suspicious network activity. The code appears to serve legitimate purposes related to permission management and source code inspection without any obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard utility code for permission validation and source inspection. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment.",
