  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Provides decorators for permission checking (`edit`, `create`, `delete`) that instantiate permission checker classes if provided as types and verify specific attributes.\n- Provides a `function` decorator that returns the source code of the decorated function using `inspect.getsource`.\n- No network, file, or environment variable operations.\n- Uses standard Python introspection and class attribute checks.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The `function` decorator exposes source code via `inspect.getsource`. If misused, this could leak sensitive code, but this is a known behavior of `inspect` and not inherently malicious.\n- Permission decorators instantiate classes if given as types, which could invoke constructors with side effects if those constructors contain code beyond simple attribute setting. However, this is a typical pattern in permission systems and not necessarily a security flaw unless the classes are untrusted or malicious.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The main concern is potential misuse:\n  - Exposing source code (`inspect.getsource`) can leak sensitive implementation details.\n  - Instantiating classes with side effects could be problematic if classes are untrusted.\n- No actual vulnerabilities or malicious code are present, but these behaviors should be used with caution.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`. The code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly `0.2` or `0`. The small risk scores seem to reflect potential information leaks rather than active vulnerabilities. Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, but it could be lowered to 0 since no actual security risk exists.\n\n### Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5):\n- No scores above 0.5 are assigned, which is appropriate. The highest risk score is 0.2, justified by the potential for source code leakage if the `function` decorator is misused.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other, uniformly indicating no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or keep at 0, considering the minimal potential for information leak)\n\n### Overall:\nThe code is a standard utility for permission validation and source code inspection. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The only concern is that exposing source code can leak sensitive information if misused, but this is a known feature of `inspect` and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for potential information leak, but minimal)\n\nThis conservative estimate aligns with the detailed review and the reports' findings.",
