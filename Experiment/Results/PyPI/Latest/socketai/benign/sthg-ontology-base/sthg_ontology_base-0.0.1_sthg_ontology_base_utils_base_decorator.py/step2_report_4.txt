  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Provides decorators (`edit`, `create`, `delete`) for permission validation.\n- Provides a `function` decorator that returns the source code of the decorated function using `inspect.getsource`.\n- Instantiates permission checker classes if provided as types, which could invoke constructors.\n- Checks for specific attributes (`is_edit`, `is_create`, `is_delete`) on permission checkers.\n- Prints permission denial messages if checks fail.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The `function` decorator exposes the source code of functions at runtime, which could leak sensitive implementation details if misused.\n- Permission decorators instantiate classes if passed as types, which could invoke constructors with side effects, potentially dangerous if those constructors are malicious or perform unintended actions.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Potential Side Effects in Class Instantiation:** Instantiating classes during permission checks might trigger code execution beyond simple attribute access, especially if constructors have side effects.\n- **Source Code Exposure:** Using `inspect.getsource()` can reveal proprietary or sensitive code, which might be a security concern if the source is not meant to be exposed.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score (0):** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or active malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score (0.2):** The main concern is the potential for accidental source code leaks and side effects from class instantiation, but these are not inherently malicious.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should remain **0**; no malicious intent or activity detected.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay **0**.\n- The **risk score** could be slightly increased to **0.3** or **0.4** to reflect the potential side effects and source code exposure, but since these are more about design considerations than active threats, keeping it at **0.2** seems reasonable.\n- The **source code exposure** via `inspect.getsource()` is a standard debugging utility but can be risky if misused, so a note should be made about its potential to leak sensitive code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (acceptable, given the context)\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is primarily utility and permission validation logic with no active malicious behavior. The main security concern is the potential leakage of source code and side effects from class instantiation, but these are not inherently malicious. Proper access controls and usage restrictions can mitigate these concerns.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese are consistent with the reports and the code's behavior.",
