{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators for permissions checking and a utility to retrieve source code of functions, possibly for introspection or debugging.",
  "sources": "inspect.getsource(func) used to obtain the source code of a function; potential user input if the function object is derived from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "The source code retrieval itself is not a sink; no untrusted data is directly outputted or transmitted. No external network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input (function object) -> getsource() -> returns source code string; permission checkers instantiated and invoked, but no data leaks or malicious actions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated logic observed. The source code retrieval is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines decorators for permission checks, which instantiate permission checker classes if needed and verify permission attributes. The 'function' decorator returns source code of a given function using inspect.getsource(). There are no external data transmissions, code injections, or malicious behaviors. The logic is simple and safe, assuming the permission checkers are trustworthy. No anomalies or obfuscation detected. Overall, the code performs introspection and permission validation without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, providing permission decorators and a source code retriever without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility module.",
