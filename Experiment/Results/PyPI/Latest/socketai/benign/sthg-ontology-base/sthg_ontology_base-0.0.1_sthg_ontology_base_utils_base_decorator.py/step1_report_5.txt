{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators for permission checking and a function to retrieve source code of other functions.",
  "sources": "Source code is read in the 'function' decorator via inspect.getsource(func). No external input or data sources are used.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sinks or output functions that could leak data or execute malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The source (inspect.getsource) is used internally to fetch source code; no data flows from untrusted input to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines decorators for permission validation and a utility to get source code of functions. The 'function' decorator uses inspect.getsource, which is standard for introspection. Permission checkers are instantiated if they are classes, which is safe and typical. No data leakage, network activity, or malicious code execution observed. No suspicious or malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard permission validation decorators and a source code retrieval utility. There is no malware, malicious intent, or security risk detected. It is safe and does not pose a security threat.",
