{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators for permission checking and a utility to retrieve source code of functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads function source code using inspect.getsource within the 'function' decorator.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "The 'function' decorator retrieves source code when the decorated function is called; permission check decorators perform permission validation before executing the target function.",
  "anomalies": "The 'function' decorator exposes source code of functions, which could potentially leak sensitive code if misused. The permission decorators instantiate classes if provided as types, which could invoke constructors with side effects if those constructors contain code beyond simple attribute setting.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of decorators for permission checks and a function to return source code. The 'function' decorator uses 'inspect.getsource' to retrieve source code, which is a standard debugging utility but can inadvertently expose sensitive code if used improperly. The permission decorators check for attributes like 'is_edit', 'is_create', 'is_delete' and instantiate class types if provided, which could execute class constructors. However, there are no network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious actions evident. The code appears to serve legitimate debugging and permission-checking purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It is designed for source code inspection and permission validation. The use of 'inspect.getsource' could leak source code if misused, but this alone is not malicious. No security risks or malware are detected in this code.",
