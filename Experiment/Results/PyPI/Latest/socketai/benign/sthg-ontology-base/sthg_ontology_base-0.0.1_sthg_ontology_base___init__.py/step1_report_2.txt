  "purpose": "The code appears to import functions and classes from utility modules, likely for use in CRUD operations and decorators within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.utils.base_decorator' and '.utils.base_crud' modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed in the snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident in this small fragment; it only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements visible in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "This code only contains import statements from local utility modules. There are no function calls, data processing, network operations, or code execution beyond importing. Without further context or additional code, there is no indication of malicious behavior, secret handling, or security issues. The imported modules could be used maliciously in other parts of the program, but this fragment alone does not reveal any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard import statement and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
