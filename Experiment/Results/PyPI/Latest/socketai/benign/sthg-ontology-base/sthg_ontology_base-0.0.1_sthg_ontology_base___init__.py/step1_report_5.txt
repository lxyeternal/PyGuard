{
  "purpose": "Importing specific functions from utility modules for decorators and CRUD operations, likely for application logic or API interaction.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions from relative modules: 'base_decorator' and 'base_crud'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not execute untrusted data or perform dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports functions without execution or data flow in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports is standard; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, importing utility functions and classes. There is no execution, data handling, or logic that could be malicious. Since the imports are from relative modules, they are part of a larger codebase. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident at this stage. The code appears to set up for further operations that are not shown here.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple import statement without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. Based on this limited code, there is no indication of malicious behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
