{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions and a class from utility modules related to decorators and CRUD operations, likely for managing or manipulating data or functionality within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.utils.base_decorator' and '.utils.base_crud' modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this snippet; potential sinks depend on how these imported functions and classes are used later in the application.",
  "flows": "Not directly applicable here, as this code only performs imports without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are evident in this import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports from internal utility modules, which is standard practice in Python projects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious activity within these import statements alone. Without additional code context, it's not possible to determine malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a larger codebase, bringing in utility functions and classes for further use.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
