  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Indicators**:\n   - All reports describe the code as simple import statements from internal utility modules.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No execution, data flow, or network activity is demonstrated.\n   - The code is standard for modular Python projects.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in stating that these are benign import statements.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the analysis.\n   - The code snippet is minimal and does not provide any execution context that could be flawed.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Issues**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security risk: 0.1\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the content.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**:\n   - Since the code only imports internal modules, and no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are demonstrated, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - The security risk score of 0.1 is very low, reflecting the minimal risk associated with import statements alone.\n   - Obfuscated score of 0 is justified as there's no obfuscation.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent based solely on import statements.\n   - They acknowledge that these modules could be used maliciously elsewhere, but the current snippet shows no such activity.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, minimal security risk, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 — Slight risk due to the potential misuse of imported modules in larger context, but minimal here.\n\n**Overall, the code snippet is benign.** It appears to be part of a larger application setup, with no immediate security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. No changes to the scores are necessary. The code is standard, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the minimal security risk score reflects that.",
