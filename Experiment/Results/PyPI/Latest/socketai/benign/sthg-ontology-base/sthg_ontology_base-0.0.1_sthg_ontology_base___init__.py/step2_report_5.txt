  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of import statements from internal utility modules. There are no signs of execution, data processing, or other potentially malicious activity within this snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign at this stage. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. No logical errors are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign very low security risk (0.1) and malware scores (0). These seem appropriate given the minimal code and lack of suspicious activity. Since the code only imports modules, these scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores**:  \n   The scores are already at the lowest levels, reflecting the benign nature of the snippet. If future code utilizes these imported functions or classes maliciously, then scores should be updated accordingly. At this point, there's no justification for higher scores.\n\n5. **Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent, which is correct. They acknowledge that these are import statements and that malicious activity could only be inferred with additional context.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports, matching the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected in this code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: **0.1** — Very low, as the code is just import statements with no evident security issues.\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the current snippet. However, **if** the imported modules or their usage in subsequent code introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, scores should be reassessed accordingly.\n- Keep monitoring how these imported functions/classes are used later in the application to ensure no malicious activity arises.\n\n**In conclusion**, based on the provided code and reports, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk at this stage.",
