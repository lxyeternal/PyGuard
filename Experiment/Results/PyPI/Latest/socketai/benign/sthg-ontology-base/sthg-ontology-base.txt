      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for permission validation and source code inspection. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The main security consideration is the potential leakage of source code via inspect.getsource, which is a known utility feature but not malicious. The permission class instantiation could have side effects if classes are untrusted, but this is a design consideration rather than a security flaw. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

Debug print statements should be removed in production. Proper validation of external inputs is recommended to mitigate injection risks. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use with standard precautions."

The primary security concern is the hardcoded password, which warrants remediation but does not constitute malware or malicious behavior."
