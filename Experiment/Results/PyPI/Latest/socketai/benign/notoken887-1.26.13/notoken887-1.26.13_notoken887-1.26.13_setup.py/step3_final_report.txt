  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Metadata fields such as author, author_email, url, and the static code in setup()",
  "sinks": "Potentially the CLI command 'notoken887' invoking 'notoken887.main:main', but no malicious activity observed",
  "flows": "Metadata fields are static; no dynamic or untrusted data flows detected",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') as unprofessional and potentially malicious indicators",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or embedded malware. The primary concern is the metadata: the provocative email and unusual URL, which could be used for misdirection or malicious branding. No malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as 0. The security risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.3) due to metadata concerns, but no active threats are evident. Confidence in benign behavior is high (around 0.8-0.9). The suspicious metadata warrants caution but does not indicate active malicious intent within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign in function but contains suspicious metadata that could be used for misdirection or malicious branding. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary concern is metadata, which warrants caution but does not constitute an active threat based solely on this code.",
