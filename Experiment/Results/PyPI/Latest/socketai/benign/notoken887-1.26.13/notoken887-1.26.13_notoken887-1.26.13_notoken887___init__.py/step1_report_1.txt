  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for general utility or application logic, but without seeing the actual code, the purpose cannot be precisely determined.",
  "sources": "Data sources may include user input functions, environment variables, or external files if present; however, none are visible in the current context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, system commands, or data output functions; specific sinks cannot be identified without actual code.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths from sources to sinks cannot be established without code details, but typical flows involve user input or environment data being processed and possibly transmitted or stored.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detectable without the code content. The code block is empty, so no unusual behavior is apparent.",
  "analysis": "Given the absence of actual code content, it is impossible to perform detailed analysis. No sources, sinks, or flows can be identified, and no anomalies are observed. The overall structure and formatting are missing, preventing further evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is empty or not included; therefore, no malicious behavior or security risks can be determined. No evidence of malware or suspicious activity is present in the current data.",
