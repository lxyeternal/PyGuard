{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution-based encryption and decryption of strings, replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input data is passed as the 'string' parameter to the encrypt method; encrypted tokens are passed to the decrypt method.",
  "sinks": "None of the code involves external systems, network communication, or storage; the functions only manipulate and return string data.",
  "flows": "Input string flows into the encrypt method, which replaces characters with emojis; the encrypted string can be decrypted back via the decrypt method, reversing the replacements.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses extensive character replacement for encoding, which is not secure encryption; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The implementation is straightforward substitution cipher, which is insecure for sensitive data but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs character substitution using chained replace calls to encode and decode strings with emojis. There are no external data sources, network operations, or suspicious code behaviors such as data exfiltration, system modifications, or hidden backdoors. The implementation is a basic encoding scheme, not cryptographically secure. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malware indicators are evident. The absence of external interactions and benign logic suggests low risk. However, the method does not provide real security; it only obfuscates data.",
  "conclusion": "The class implements a basic, non-secure substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings. No malicious behavior, external data handling, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code does not pose a security threat but offers only superficial obfuscation.",
