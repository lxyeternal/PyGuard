{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides methods to encode (encrypt) and decode (decrypt) strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through method parameters 'string' for encryption and 'encrypted_token' for decryption.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leakage points are evident; the functions only perform string replacements locally.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via character replacement into emoji sequences and then reversed back, forming source-to-sink flow within the same class methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive character replacements but does not include any network communication, system commands, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The use of emoji replacements appears to be a simple obfuscation or encoding scheme, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The TokenCryptor class implements a basic character substitution cipher using emojis. The encrypt method replaces alphanumeric and some special characters with emojis, while the decrypt method reverses this process. Both methods operate solely on string data with straightforward replace calls. There are no external data sources, no network activity, and no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The design appears to be an obfuscation or encoding technique rather than malicious code. The code is clear, simple, and does not exhibit obfuscation patterns typical of malware. No suspicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an emoji-based encoder and decoder, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and intended for obfuscation or encoding purposes, not malicious activity.",
