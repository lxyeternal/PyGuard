{
  "purpose": "A lightweight API client for interacting with an external service, handling authentication via tokens, and supporting retries.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'IGNITE_API' for API base URL, token file at ~/.ignite_token, user-provided token parameter, HTTP request headers, and request payloads.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to the API endpoint, reading from token file, writing token to disk.",
  "flows": "Token is loaded from environment or disk, used in request headers for authorization, and potentially updated via save_token method. Requests are made through the session, with headers including the token, and responses are processed for errors or JSON content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; token stored in a file with restrictive permissions. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No signs of code that executes dynamically or performs hidden actions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard HTTP client with token-based authentication, retries, and error handling. Token is securely loaded from a file with permission set to owner-only (0o600). The API URL can be configured via environment variable, providing flexibility and security. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The code handles network errors and API error responses appropriately. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. The overall design appears safe and typical for an API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an API client with proper handling of authentication tokens and retries. There are no indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. The code is well-structured, and its functions are standard for such a client.",
