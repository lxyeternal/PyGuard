{
  "purpose": "The code provides a lightweight API client wrapper around the requests library, handling authentication with tokens and retries for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (IGNITE_API), token file from the user's home directory (~/.ignite_token), and user-provided tokens via method arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs and sends HTTP requests including authorization headers with bearer tokens, and processes JSON responses. It also writes tokens to a file.",
  "flows": "Token is loaded from a file or provided as an argument, then included in request headers for API calls. Responses are processed for errors or returned data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs detected. Proper use of retries and safe environment variable handling.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads tokens from a file or parameter, and writes tokens with restrictive permissions (600). It uses standard libraries and handles errors appropriately. The request flow involves typical API call patterns with authentication. No signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears well-structured and safe, with no hidden backdoors or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured API client wrapper that manages tokens securely and handles retries appropriately. It does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks based on the provided content.",
