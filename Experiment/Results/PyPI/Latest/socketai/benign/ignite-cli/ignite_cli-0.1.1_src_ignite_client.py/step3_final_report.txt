  "purpose": "A lightweight API client wrapping requests with authentication and retries.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'IGNITE_API', token file '~/.ignite_token', optional token parameter.",
  "sinks": "Network requests via requests.Session, token file for storing token, response parsing.",
  "flows": "Token loaded or saved from file or environment variable, used in request headers, response processed accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard practices for API communication, including secure token handling, retries, and error management. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. Token permissions are set securely, and network interactions are typical for an API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Security risks are minimal and within acceptable bounds.",
