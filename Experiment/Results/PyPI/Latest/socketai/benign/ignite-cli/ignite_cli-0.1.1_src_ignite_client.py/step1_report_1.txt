{
  "purpose": "This code provides a lightweight API client to interact with a specific web service, handling authentication, retries, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'IGNITE_API' for API base URL, token file at ~/.ignite_token for authentication token, user-supplied token parameter, and potentially untrusted input via request parameters.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests sent via the requests library, token written to disk, and responses parsed as JSON or text.",
  "flows": "Token is loaded from a file or environment; request headers include Authorization with token; request sent over HTTPS; response is processed and returned to caller.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL, or malicious code patterns observed. Token handling appears standard. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation. Error handling is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads tokens from a file or parameter, uses environment variables for configuration, and manages requests with retries. It sanitizes and handles errors appropriately. No suspicious or malicious activities detected. There are no backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads. The use of requests for API calls and token management is standard practice. No indication of malicious behavior, privacy violations, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard implementation of an API client with proper token management and error handling. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
