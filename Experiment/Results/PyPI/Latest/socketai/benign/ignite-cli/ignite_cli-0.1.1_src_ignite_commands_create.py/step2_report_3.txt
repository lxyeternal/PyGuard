  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The script provides CLI commands to create resources via SDK/API, reading tokens from a file and data from stdin/files.  \n- **Sinks:** Calls SDK functions to send data to external APIs.  \n- **Flows:** Input → request objects → API calls.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for API interactions, with proper input validation and secure token handling. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity) — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation) — justified.  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to external API calls) — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent with the analysis. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, reading JSON/YAML from files or stdin.  \n- **Sinks:** API calls via SDK functions.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above, legitimate CLI wrapper, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** CLI for resource creation, reading input from files or stdin, environment variables for token and API base URL.  \n- **Sinks:** SDK API calls.  \n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation, standard practices.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate CLI tool, standard data handling, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — slightly lower, but still reasonable given the low risk profile.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, with standard input handling.  \n- **Sinks:** SDK API calls over network.  \n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate CLI wrapper, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — consistent with low risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** CLI for resource creation, reading input from files or stdin, token from file.  \n- **Sinks:** SDK API calls.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard CLI utility, legitimate, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, justified by the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly vary between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero potential for issues due to external API interactions, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a standard CLI wrapper around SDK API calls.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The scores across reports are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to network interactions but no signs of exploitation)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments. No further changes are necessary.",
