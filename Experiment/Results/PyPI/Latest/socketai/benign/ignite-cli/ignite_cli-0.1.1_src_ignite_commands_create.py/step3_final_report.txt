  "purpose": "A CLI utility to create repositories, projects, and subscriptions by reading input data from files or stdin, and invoking SDK API calls.",
  "sources": "Reads token from TOKEN_FILE; reads JSON/YAML data from specified files or stdin.",
  "sinks": "Calls SDK API functions to create resources, which communicate with external services.",
  "flows": "Input data (file or stdin) -> parse as JSON/YAML -> construct request objects -> invoke SDK API functions -> external API responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets (besides token read from file), obfuscation, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around SDK API calls for resource creation. It handles input validation, token management, and data parsing securely. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The API interactions are standard and do not exhibit suspicious network activity or data leakage. The token is read from a file with exception handling, and no hardcoded secrets are found. The structure and logic are typical for such tools, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI utility with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the risk score remains minimal (~0.1-0.2). The reports' assessments are consistent and accurate.",
