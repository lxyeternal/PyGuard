  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code quality, and consistency of the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a CLI wrapper around SDK API calls.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic are detected.\n- The input handling, token reading, and API interactions are standard and appropriate.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, with proper input validation and error handling.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or dynamic execution.\n- **External API calls:** Use of SDK functions is standard; no suspicious network activity is directly observable.\n- **Sensitive data handling:** Token read from a file with error handling; no hardcoded secrets.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent; no logical errors are apparent.\n- The only minor point is that the code relies on the SDK's security and correctness, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is justified.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2) is reasonable given the code's purpose and the external dependencies.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes needed unless new evidence emerges.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** (low, typical for CLI wrappers around SDKs)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to reliance on external SDKs and input handling, but overall low risk)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is a legitimate, straightforward CLI tool with no malicious or obfuscated components.",
