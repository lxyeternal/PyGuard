  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Implements a CLI for IgniteOps with authentication, status, and dynamic command loading.\n- Uses standard libraries (click, typer, rich).\n- Manages tokens via TOKEN_FILE.\n- Loads additional commands dynamically from a \"commands\" directory.\n- Uses sys.path modification to ensure module importability.\n- No obfuscated code or hardcoded credentials.\n- No evident malicious behavior or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- No malicious code or malware detected.\n- Dynamic module loading is standard but could be risky if modules are compromised.\n- Token handling appears straightforward.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n**Score evaluation:**\n\n- The report's malware score of 0 aligns with the code analysis.\n- Security risk is low, given the potential for malicious modules if the \"commands\" directory is compromised, but no actual malicious code is present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's scoring seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on dynamic import risks.\n- No malicious code detected.\n- Token management is straightforward.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n**Score evaluation:**\n\n- Malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The potential risk due to dynamic import is acknowledged but not scored higher, which is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scoring is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Highlights the dynamic import of modules as a potential risk.\n- No malicious code or backdoors detected.\n- Token file operations are standard.\n- Confidence: 0.8, malware: 0, risk: 0.3.\n\n**Score evaluation:**\n\n- Malware remains at 0, which is justified.\n- The risk score is slightly higher (0.3) due to the dynamic import potential, which is reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Emphasizes standard plugin architecture.\n- No malicious behavior or code.\n- Token handling appears safe.\n- Confidence: 0.95, malware: 0, risk: 0.1.\n\n**Score evaluation:**\n\n- Malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The low risk score aligns with the lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Similar to others, no malicious activity.\n- Uses standard patterns.\n- No suspicious code.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n**Score evaluation:**\n\n- Malware score of 0 matches the analysis.\n- Risk score is low, considering dynamic loading is standard but could be exploited if modules are compromised.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code analysis. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, which is correct; no obfuscated code detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varies between 0.1 and 0.3, reflecting the potential risk of dynamic module loading, but no actual vulnerabilities are found.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code appears secure and well-structured.\n- The dynamic import mechanism, while standard, could be a vector if the \"commands\" directory is compromised, but this is a known pattern in plugin systems.\n- No changes needed to scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n\n**Risk:** 0.2 — moderate due to dynamic module loading, but no active threats.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is secure with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The risk is low, primarily due to the dynamic plugin architecture, which is common but requires proper access controls.\n\n**Final note:** Maintain proper permissions on the \"commands\" directory to prevent malicious modules from being introduced.",
