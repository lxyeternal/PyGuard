{
  "purpose": "This script serves as the main CLI application for IgniteOps, handling authentication and dynamically loading commands.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, reads environment variables, accesses TOKEN_FILE, and uses user input through CLI options.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe inputs include command-line options (--token, --no-browser), but these are standard for CLI tools and do not process untrusted data into sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Input options from CLI (token, browser) influence authentication flow and token storage; dynamic module loading for commands, no external data flows or untrusted sources are processed into system-critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials detected; dynamic module loading is standard, no obfuscated code, no unusual code structures; no malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes a CLI application with authentication commands, dynamic command loading, and utility functions. It uses safe patterns for plugin/module loading, and does not handle untrusted data streams or perform any suspicious actions. The token management is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or dangerous code injection points. The use of dynamic import of command modules appears standard for plugin-like CLI structures. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI application setup for IgniteOps with standard patterns for command registration, authentication, and plugin management. No malicious or suspicious activities are detected.",
