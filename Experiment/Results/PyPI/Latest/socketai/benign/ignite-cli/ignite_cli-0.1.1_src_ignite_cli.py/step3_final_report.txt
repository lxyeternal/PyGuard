{
  "purpose": "This code implements a command-line interface (CLI) for IgniteOps, providing authentication, status checks, and dynamic command loading from a 'commands' directory.",
  "sources": "Reads user input for login/logout, token management via TOKEN_FILE, and dynamically imports modules from the 'commands' directory using pkgutil and importlib.",
  "sinks": "Token file operations (save/delete), dynamic module imports which could execute untrusted code if modules are compromised.",
  "flows": "User triggers commands (login, logout, status, dynamically loaded commands) which read/write tokens and import modules from the 'commands' directory.",
  "anomalies": "Uses sys.path manipulation to include project root, and dynamically loads modules from an external directory, which could be exploited if the directory is compromised. No obfuscated code or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI setup with authentication and plugin architecture. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The dynamic import pattern is common but could pose risks if the 'commands' directory is not secured. No signs of obfuscation or malware. The token management is straightforward. The overall structure is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured CLI application with no malicious behavior detected. The primary security concern is ensuring the integrity and security of the dynamically loaded modules. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the potential risk inherent in dynamic plugin loading but no active threat.",
