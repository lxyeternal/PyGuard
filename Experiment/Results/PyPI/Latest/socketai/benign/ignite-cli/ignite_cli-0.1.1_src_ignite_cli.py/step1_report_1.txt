{
  "purpose": "The code implements a CLI application for IgniteOps, including authentication, status checks, and dynamic command loading.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables and system paths, imports modules, and reads/writes token files.",
  "sinks": "Writes tokens to disk, potentially exposes token data; executes commands and imports modules dynamically.",
  "flows": "Token input from command-line options -> save_token method; dynamic import of commands -> execution; token removal -> unlinking token file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic module loading for commands poses some risk if modules are compromised; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected; no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a CLI application with authentication and command execution features. It imports and dynamically loads command modules, manages token files, and interfaces with external authentication services. No malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft are apparent. The dynamic import mechanism is standard for plugin-like architectures but can be risky if malicious modules are introduced. The token management involves writing and deleting files but appears straightforward and controlled. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected. Overall, the code appears secure, with no evident malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard CLI application with modular command loading and token management. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present based on the code review.",
