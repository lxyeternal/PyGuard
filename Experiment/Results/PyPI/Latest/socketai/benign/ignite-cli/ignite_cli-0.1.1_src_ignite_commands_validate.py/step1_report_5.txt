  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for validating project creation settings using an SDK client.",
  "sources": "Token file reading (TOKEN_FILE.read_text()), command line arguments (body, json, yaml_).",
  "sinks": "SDK client initialization, show() function for output.",
  "flows": "Token reading from file -> _sdk_client() creates AuthenticatedClient -> validate_project_sync call -> show() outputs result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious data flows, no unusual code structures. Use of try-except around token reading is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a token from a file if available, then initializes an SDK client with this token. The validate_project command takes user input (body) and options for output formatting, then calls a validation API. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, nor suspicious network or system behavior is present. The code functions as a straightforward CLI wrapper for an SDK call, with standard exception handling for token reading.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI wrapper for SDK validation, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It reads a token from a file securely (if present) and calls a validation API without any suspicious actions.",
