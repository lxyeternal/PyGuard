  "purpose": "Shared helper functions for formatting and displaying CLI output, including serialization of complex objects to JSON/YAML and pretty printing.",
  "sources": "None explicitly read untrusted input; data to display is assumed to be provided by the caller.",
  "sinks": "console.print, console.print_json, yaml.safe_dump, pprint, and the recursive _to_serializable function for converting objects.",
  "flows": "Data is serialized via _to_serializable, then displayed using various print functions depending on format flags and data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Usage of standard libraries, with safe serialization and display logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides serialization and display utilities, converting complex objects, including SDK models, datetime, dicts, lists, and scalars, into human-readable formats or raw JSON/YAML. It safely handles sentinel values like Unset, converts datetime objects to ISO format, and uses standard libraries for pretty printing. No input/output operations suggest untrusted input handling, and all data flows are limited to safe serialization and display. The code avoids unsafe operations, external network calls, or execution of untrusted code. The use of try/except for import fallback is benign and aimed at compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, utility functions for formatting output, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It employs safe practices for data serialization and presentation. Overall, it appears to be benign and intended for user interface purposes.",
