  "purpose": "Helper functions for formatting and displaying CLI output with support for JSON, YAML, and rich text representations.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from function parameters, external SDK import, and internal object attributes.",
  "sinks": "Console print functions, json.dumps, yaml.safe_dump, and pprint.",
  "flows": "Input data is serialized via _to_serializable, then conditionally formatted and printed. Data flows from input to serialization, then to output functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute access, generic to_dict method, and multiple data format conversions; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serializes complex objects into JSON or YAML formats and displays them via rich.console. It includes safe handling of datetime and Unset objects, converting them into serializable forms. The functions do not execute or evaluate untrusted code; they only format and display data. External imports are for display purposes and do not introduce security risks. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or network activity are present. The use of the 'rich' library is standard for CLI output, and the _to_serializable function properly handles various data types without executing arbitrary code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for formatting and displaying data in CLI applications. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. It performs standard serialization and display tasks with no apparent security issues.",
