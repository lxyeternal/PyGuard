  "purpose": "Helper functions for formatting CLI output, serializing complex objects, and displaying data in various formats.",
  "sources": "Data passed into 'show' function; objects with 'to_dict' method; datetime objects; Unset sentinel; input data structures.",
  "sinks": "Console output via rich, yaml.safe_dump, json.dumps; no external system modifications or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input data -> serialization (_to_serializable) -> display (console.print, print_json, print YAML, tables, pprint).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; fallback for Unset is benign; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; safe handling of data.",
  "analysis": "The code provides safe, standard serialization and display functions for CLI tools. It handles complex objects, datetime, and a sentinel value. No network, file, or command execution occurs. The import fallback for 'Unset' is benign. The functions are designed for safe data presentation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for CLI data formatting and display. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, and the data flow is strictly for presentation purposes. The assigned malware score of 0.0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score of 0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
