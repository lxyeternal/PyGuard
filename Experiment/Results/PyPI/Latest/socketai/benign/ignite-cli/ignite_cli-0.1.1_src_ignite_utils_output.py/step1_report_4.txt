  "purpose": "Helpers for formatting and displaying CLI output, including serializing complex objects and pretty-printing data.",
  "sources": "Reading data from input parameters, data passed to show(), environment variables (indirectly via imported modules), and external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Console output via rich.console.Console, yaml.safe_dump, json.dumps, pprint, and rich's print_json.",
  "flows": "Data is serialized by _to_serializable, then sent to console.print_json, console.print, or yaml.safe_dump for display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of try-except for optional import suggests environment flexibility but not malicious intent. No network calls, file writes, or suspicious dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides serialization of various data types, including datetime and SDK-specific Unset sentinel, then displays data in human-readable, JSON, or YAML formats. The use of rich library functions is for presentation, not security-sensitive operations. No input is directly used in insecure commands or insecure environments. No external network activity, credential handling, or suspicious behaviors are present. The try-except block for optional imports is a common pattern to support testing environments, not malicious. Overall, the code focuses on formatting and outputting data without performing any operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for CLI data presentation. It contains no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to serialize and display data in various formats with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
