{
  "purpose": "Helper functions for formatting and displaying CLI output, including serialization of complex objects and pretty printing.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (json, yaml, datetime, typing) and third-party 'rich' for display. Reads input data in the 'show' function parameter.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'console.print' and related methods to display data; no untrusted input is directly written to external systems or files. Serialization functions process input data but do not write or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into '_to_serializable' for conversion, then into 'show' for display. The display methods handle various data types but do not perform network or file operations with untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code uses standard libraries and common display logic. Placeholder class for 'Unset' is benign. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines serialization helpers to convert complex objects into JSON-serializable formats, including handling datetime and SDK-specific 'Unset' sentinel. The 'show' function formats data into JSON, YAML, tables, or plain text for CLI output, with logic to handle different data structures. It includes fallback mechanisms and heuristics for table formatting. No code suggests malicious intent, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No network or system modification operations are present. The only data handling is for display purposes, and all processing is local.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module designed for formatting CLI output. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on its current logic. It mainly serializes and displays data, with no external data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors.",
