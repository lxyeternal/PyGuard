  "purpose": "This script provides command-line interfaces to delete repositories and projects using the igniteops SDK.",
  "sources": "Reads token from TOKEN_FILE, command-line arguments for repo_id and project_id, and SDK functions for deletion.",
  "sinks": "SDK delete functions potentially perform destructive actions on repositories and projects. The show() function outputs responses, possibly sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Token read from TOKEN_FILE -> _sdk_client() -> AuthenticatedClient -> delete_repository_sync or delete_project_sync -> show() output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious data leaks or unusual code. No obfuscated code detected; straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an authenticated client by reading a token from a file, then provides CLI commands to delete repositories or projects via the SDK. The delete functions are invoked with arguments that are directly passed from CLI, with no evident data validation or sanitization beyond default values. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The show() function outputs response data, which could include sensitive info if the SDK returns such, but this is standard behavior for command-line output. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs. All operations are command-driven deletions which, while destructive, are typical for administrative scripts and do not inherently contain malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI tool for deleting repositories and projects using the igniteops SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The actions performed are destructive but expected for this type of utility. No security risks or malicious anomalies are detected.",
