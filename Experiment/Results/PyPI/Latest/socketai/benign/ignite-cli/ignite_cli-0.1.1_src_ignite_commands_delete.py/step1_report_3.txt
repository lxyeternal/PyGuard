{
  "purpose": "The code provides command-line interface functions for deleting repositories and projects via an SDK client, likely used for managing infrastructure or services.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from TOKEN_FILE (file system), function arguments (repo_id, project_id), and environment variables (via TOKEN_FILE).",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to SDK functions (delete_repository_sync, delete_project_sync), and displays responses via show(), which may output to console or logs.",
  "flows": "Token is read from TOKEN_FILE, then used to authenticate API client; repo_id and project_id are received from user input and passed to SDK delete functions; responses are displayed via show().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. The token is read from a file that could be user-controlled or potentially malicious if the file contents are manipulated. The code structure is standard; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code safely manages token retrieval from a file, handling exceptions gracefully. It utilizes standard SDK calls for deletion operations, passing user input as arguments. No malicious payloads or suspicious behaviors are evident. The operations involve deletion commands, which are destructive but legitimate functions. No data leaks, reverse shells, or network communications beyond SDK interactions are present. The code appears to be straightforward CLI wrappers around SDK methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI interface for deleting repositories and projects via an SDK. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain risks. Potential security considerations include ensuring token file security, but the code itself is benign.",
