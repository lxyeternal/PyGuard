{
  "purpose": "The code provides command-line interfaces to delete repositories and projects via the igniteops SDK.",
  "sources": "Reading TOKEN_FILE content for authentication token; reading command-line arguments (repo_id, project_id, json, yaml); importing modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "Calling SDK functions for deletion (delete_repository_sync, delete_project_sync); displaying responses via show()",
  "flows": "Token read from TOKEN_FILE -> _sdk_client() creates AuthenticatedClient -> delete functions called with arguments -> show() displays response",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual or obfuscated code; standard usage of SDK and CLI options; no dynamic code execution or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The script loads an authentication token from a file, which appears standard and controlled. It defines CLI commands for deleting repositories and projects, invoking SDK functions with provided IDs. The show() function displays responses, which is expected. No malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are present. The code relies on SDK functions and CLI options without involving untrusted input processing beyond argument passing. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior in this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for delete operations using the SDK. It does not contain malicious code or security risks. The design appears standard and safe.",
