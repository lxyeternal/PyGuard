{
  "purpose": "The code provides command-line interface commands for deleting repositories and projects using the igniteops SDK, with functionality to handle tokens and output formatting.",
  "sources": "Reading token from TOKEN_FILE, importing SDK modules, receiving command arguments (repo_id, project_id).",
  "sinks": "Calling SDK delete functions with potentially untrusted IDs, displaying responses with show().",
  "flows": "Input tokens and IDs flow into SDK client creation and delete functions, with output shown via show().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard usage of SDK functions and file reading; no suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a client by reading a token from a file, handles command-line arguments for deleting repositories and projects, and outputs responses. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or code injection are evident. Use of SDK functions and reading tokens from a file is typical and not inherently malicious. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI wrapper for SDK delete operations, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It securely reads tokens and performs deletions based on user input, which is expected behavior for administrative scripts.",
