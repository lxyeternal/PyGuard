  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for deleting repositories and projects via SDK functions, managing authentication tokens from a file.",
  "sources": "Reads token from TOKEN_FILE; accepts repo_id and project_id as arguments.",
  "sinks": "Calls delete_repository_sync and delete_project_sync with user-provided IDs; outputs via show().",
  "flows": "Token read from file -> SDK delete functions called with IDs -> show() outputs responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; exception handling is broad but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool for deletion operations, with token management via file reading. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is present. The delete functions are expected for such administrative scripts. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior. No input validation issues are evident, and the exception handling is standard. The destructive nature of delete commands is acknowledged but considered legitimate. Overall, the code is benign, with low security risk and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward CLI wrapper for deletion operations with no malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk is low, primarily due to the destructive nature of delete commands, which is expected. The assigned scores are accurate and justified.",
