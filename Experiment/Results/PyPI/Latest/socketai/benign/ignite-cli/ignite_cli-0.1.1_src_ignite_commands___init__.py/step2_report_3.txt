  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, assess the reasoning, and ensure the scores align with the content.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, auto-generated module consisting solely of comments and an empty list declaration.\n- No executable code, data handling, input/output, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:**  \n  The code contains only comments and an empty list; no functional or executable code. No security issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious constructs are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**  \n  The reports correctly identify the code as benign, auto-generated, and structural. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - `malware`: 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n  - `obfuscated`: 0, as no obfuscation patterns are present.\n  - `securityRisk`: 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are identified.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- The reports correctly interpret the code as documentation or placeholders for CLI command modules, with no executable or malicious elements.\n- The references to external scripts (`scripts/gen_cli.py`) are about auto-generation, not malicious activity.\n- The absence of data flow, input/output, or external interactions confirms the low risk.\n\n### Potential improvements:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is purely structural, auto-generated documentation with no executable logic, data handling, or suspicious patterns. It poses no security threat or malware risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning aligns with the code content. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
