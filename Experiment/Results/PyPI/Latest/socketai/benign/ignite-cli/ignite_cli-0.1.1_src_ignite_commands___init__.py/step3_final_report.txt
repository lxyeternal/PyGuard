  "purpose": "This code serves as an auto-generated module containing CLI command definitions, primarily consisting of comments and an empty list for exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it contains only a module docstring and a variable declaration.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the code contains only static comments and an empty list declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely structural, auto-generated documentation for CLI command modules. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. The absence of code execution, secrets, or malicious constructs indicates a benign nature. The code's simplicity and documentation purpose align with a low security risk profile. All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, with appropriate zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the straightforward content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated stub with no security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The reports' evaluations and scores are accurate and should remain as-is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
