  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'ignite' package or set a default version if not installed",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() function call, package name 'ignite'",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sink; the code only assigns a version string to __version__",
  "flows": "Attempt to get package version (source) and assign to __version__, fallback to default if package not found",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard pattern for optional dependency handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info functions, then attempts to retrieve the version of the 'ignite' package. If the package is missing, it sets __version__ to '0.0.0'. The use of try-except for PackageNotFoundError is standard for handling missing packages. There are no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code. The code simply manages package version info with a common pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely handles missing dependencies and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
