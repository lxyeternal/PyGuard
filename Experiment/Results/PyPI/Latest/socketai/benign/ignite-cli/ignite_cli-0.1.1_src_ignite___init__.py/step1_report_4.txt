{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'ignite' package or set a default if not found",
  "sources": "The 'version' function from 'importlib.metadata' to get package info; the 'try-except' block to handle errors",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; setting a string value (__version__) is safe",
  "flows": "Attempt to get package version (source) and assign to __version__; fallback to '0.0.0' if not found",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package version retrieval with exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code safely attempts to obtain the version of a package named 'ignite' using importlib.metadata.version. If the package is not installed, it catches the PackageNotFoundError exception and assigns a default version string '0.0.0'. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a simple utility to check package versioning status, with proper error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended to reliably retrieve package version information with fallback. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
