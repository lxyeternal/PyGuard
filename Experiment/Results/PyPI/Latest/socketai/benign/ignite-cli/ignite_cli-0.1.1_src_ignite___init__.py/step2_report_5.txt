  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the original code.\n\n**Summary of the original code:**\n- It imports `version` from `importlib.metadata`.\n- It attempts to get the version of the package \"ignite\".\n- If the package isn't found (`PackageNotFoundError`), it assigns `\"0.0.0\"` to `__version__`.\n- The code is straightforward, uses standard library functions, and handles errors properly.\n- No external inputs, outputs, or data leaks are involved.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, analysis, conclusion, confidence, scores.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the report accurately describes the code as benign, standard, and safe.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar description, emphasizes standard practices, no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no issues.\n- **Scores:** Consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same findings, straightforward, handles missing package gracefully.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates the purpose, source, sink, flow, anomalies, analysis, conclusion.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar analysis, confirms standard pattern, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  All reports agree the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is standard for retrieving package version info with proper error handling.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the report?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n- **Scores justification:**  \n  All malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify that the code does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a simple, safe utility to retrieve package version info.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. The code remains safe and non-malicious.",
