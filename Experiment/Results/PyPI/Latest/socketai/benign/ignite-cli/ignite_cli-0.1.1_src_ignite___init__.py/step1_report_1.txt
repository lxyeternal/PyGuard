  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'ignite' package or default to '0.0.0' if not installed",
  "sources": "Importing 'version' from importlib.metadata; calling 'version(\"ignite\")' to get package version",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used to influence external systems or data leaks",
  "flows": "Attempt to get package version (source) and assign to __version__; fallback assigns '0.0.0' (sink)",
  "anomalies": "Use of exception handling for missing package; no suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code aims to safely retrieve the version of a package named 'ignite'. It handles the case where the package might not be installed by catching PackageNotFoundError and assigning a default version. No data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code uses standard Python libraries and practices. No external inputs or outputs are involved, and there are no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign attempt to determine a package version with proper error handling. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
