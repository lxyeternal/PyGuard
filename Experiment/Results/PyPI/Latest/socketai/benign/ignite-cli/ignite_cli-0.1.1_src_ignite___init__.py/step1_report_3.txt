  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'ignite' package or default to '0.0.0' if not found.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using importlib.metadata's version() function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data, user input, or external data manipulation are present.",
  "flows": "The source is the version() function call; the sink is assigning to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info from importlib.metadata to get the version of 'ignite'. It handles the case where the package is not installed by setting a default version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. It uses standard library functions appropriately with exception handling for a missing package.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign attempt to check for a package version with proper error handling. There are no indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks.",
