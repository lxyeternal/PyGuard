{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'ignite' package or set a default version if not installed.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using importlib.metadata.version('ignite') and handles PackageNotFoundError exception.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code only assigns a version string to __version__.",
  "flows": "The source (importlib.metadata.version call) flows into the exception handling to assign __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard library functions and simple exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to retrieve the installed package version of 'ignite' using importlib.metadata. If the package is not found, it assigns a default version '0.0.0'. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The logic is straightforward, and the use of exception handling is standard for this purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a typical purpose of retrieving package version info with fallback. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
