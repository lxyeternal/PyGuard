  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and compare them against the original code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code's purpose is to retrieve the version of the 'ignite' package or default to '0.0.0' if not installed.\n   - The code uses `importlib.metadata.version()` with exception handling for `PackageNotFoundError`.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious activities are detected in any report.\n   - The code is standard, straightforward, and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly state that no data leaks, untrusted data sinks, or malicious code are present.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The reasoning about the code's benign nature and proper error handling is sound.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward code.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty, which is justified.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is simple, uses standard libraries, and handles errors properly, there's no reason to assign a higher risk.\n   - The absence of any suspicious activity justifies a zero risk score.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume malicious intent; they rely on code analysis.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or exploits are made, only about the code's benign nature.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All scores align with the analysis provided.\n   - The uniformity across reports supports their accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard, safe utility for retrieving package version info with proper error handling. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                                  |\n|------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious activity detected.                                |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.          |\n| Security Risk    | 0            | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.            |\n\n**Note:** The reports are accurate and consistent; no changes are necessary.",
