{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'ignite' package if installed, otherwise default to '0.0.0'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the package metadata via importlib.metadata.version() and handles exceptions if the package is not found.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs; the code only assigns a version string to __version__.",
  "flows": "Source: importlib.metadata.version() call; Sink: assignment to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard library functions with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info for 'ignite', attempts to retrieve it, and defaults to '0.0.0' if not found. It uses standard practices, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The exception handling is appropriate, and the code does not perform any network or data exfiltration activities. The code is simple, clear, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for package version retrieval with proper error handling. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
