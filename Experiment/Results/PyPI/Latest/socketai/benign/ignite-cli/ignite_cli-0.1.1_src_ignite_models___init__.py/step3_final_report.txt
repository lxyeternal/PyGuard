  "sources": "Comments describing the purpose of the models; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or external data sinks; code contains only comments.",
  "flows": "No executable code or data flow; purely descriptive comments.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious patterns; only comments present.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely a comment indicating the purpose of defining Pydantic models. There are no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions. The comments are straightforward and do not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious signals are present. The overall assessment confirms that the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple descriptive comment with no executable or malicious content. The security risk, malware, and obfuscation scores are appropriately set to zero. The code does not present any vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, and the reports are accurate and consistent.",
