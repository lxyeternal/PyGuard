  "purpose": "Define Pydantic models for request and response payloads in an application.",
  "sources": "No input reading; the code imports Pydantic but does not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways identified; no data processing or transfer occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Code is purely a comment describing models; lacks actual model definitions or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment line describing the purpose of defining Pydantic models. There are no model classes, no functions, and no data handling code present. The absence of executable code or data processing steps means there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. Since no operational code exists, there is no risk of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a non-executable comment describing the intended purpose of models. It does not contain any actual code, logic, or data handling, and therefore poses no security risk or malicious behavior.",
