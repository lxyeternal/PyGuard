  "purpose": "Define Pydantic models for request and response payloads",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only model definitions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; simple data models",
  "flows": "No data flow; models are static definitions",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any code that performs data processing, network operations, or insecure handling",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment indicating it contains Pydantic models for payloads. No executable code, data handling, or external interactions are present. This is a straightforward declaration with no potential for malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a simple, standard comment describing a module's purpose.",
