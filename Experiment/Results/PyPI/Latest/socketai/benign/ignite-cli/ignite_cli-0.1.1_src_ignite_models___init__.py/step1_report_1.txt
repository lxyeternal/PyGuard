  "purpose": "The code provides Pydantic models for request and response payload validation.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading; relies on external data passed to Pydantic models.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; models only validate data structures.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; solely defines data schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting only of a comment describing its purpose. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious activity. The structure is straightforward and typical for defining data models using Pydantic. Given the limited content, there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard comment indicating the purpose of the module. There is no malicious or suspicious behavior present.",
