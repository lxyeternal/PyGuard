  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports describe the code as merely a comment string: `\"\"\"Utility helpers reused across the CLI.\"\"\"` with no executable code, data handling, or external interactions. There are no sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies identified in any report. Given that, **there is no actual code to analyze for malicious behavior or vulnerabilities**.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent in stating that the snippet is only a comment and contains no executable logic. They correctly conclude that no security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. There are no logical flaws or mistakes in their reasoning, as they are based on the actual content provided.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Correct, since there's no obfuscation in a comment string.  \n- **Malware Score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity can be inferred from a comment.  \n- **Security Risk Score (0):** Correct, no executable code or data handling implies no security risk.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nGiven the absence of any executable code or suspicious constructs, there's no justification for higher scores. All reports correctly assign a score of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n5. **Challenge Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nSome might argue that comments could hide malicious intent, but without executable code, such claims are speculative. The reports correctly avoid such assumptions.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**  \nScores are consistent across all reports, reflecting the lack of code, data flow, or malicious indicators.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment**  \nBased on the provided snippet and reports, **the code is benign and contains no security concerns**. The reports are accurate in their analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Estimated malware score:** 0  \n- **Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Estimated security risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely a comment with no executable or suspicious elements. Without code, there is no basis for malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No changes needed. The snippet is harmless, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
