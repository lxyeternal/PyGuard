  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the provided code snippet.\n\n1. **Code Content Analysis:**\nAll reports are based on the same minimal snippet: a docstring comment stating \"Utility helpers reused across the CLI.\" There is no executable code, data handling, or logic present in any of these snippets.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n- Since the code is only a comment, there are no sources, sinks, data flows, or anomalies to analyze.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks can be inferred from a comment alone.\n- The reports correctly identify the absence of executable code and potential security concerns.\n\n3. **Score Justification:**\n- All reports assign `malware`, `obfuscated`, and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the lack of code.\n- The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which makes sense because the analysis is straightforward and based solely on a comment.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Logical Errors in Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly conclude that no malicious or security issues are present.\n- Since no executable code exists, there are no grounds to challenge their reasoning or scores.\n\n5. **Recommendations:**\n- Given the complete absence of code, any risk or malware scores higher than 0 would be unwarranted.\n- The reports are thorough and cautious, correctly reflecting the situation.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity present)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided snippet and reports, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. All scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is purely a comment with no executable logic.\n- All reports correctly identify the lack of any security concerns.\n- No changes to scores or reasoning are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current assessments are accurate; no further action needed.",
