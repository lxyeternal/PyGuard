  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the provided code snippet contains only a comment string with no executable code, data handling, or logic. There are no functions, data flows, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in stating that the code is just a comment. They correctly identify that no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks can be inferred from such a snippet.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the lack of code or obfuscation.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of executable code or data flows.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely a comment, there is no reason to assign a higher risk score. The scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   Given the absence of code, data flows, or external interactions, the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that no security issues are present.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and appropriate for the content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity present)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation or code present)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\nSince the snippet is just a comment, there is no actionable code or behavior to analyze. If future code snippets include actual functions or logic, a re-evaluation would be necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The scores are appropriate given the minimal content. No changes are needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.",
