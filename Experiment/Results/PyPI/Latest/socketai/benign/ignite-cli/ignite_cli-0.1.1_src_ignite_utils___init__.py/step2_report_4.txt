  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \nAll reports indicate that the code snippet contains only a comment string describing utility helpers for CLI. There is no executable code, data handling, or logic present. Therefore, there are no actual issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activities in the provided code snippets.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is purely a comment and contains no executable logic, data flows, or anomalies. No mistakes or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of code or any obfuscation.  \n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the fact that there's no malicious behavior or code present.  \n- **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified as there are no security concerns in a comment-only snippet.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \nSince the code is only a comment with no executable content, no risk scores higher than 0 are justified. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations**:  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. If there were malicious code, it would be reflected here, but in this case, there isn't.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly noting that the snippet is just a comment and contains no suspicious behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\nGiven the total absence of executable code, data flows, or suspicious constructs, the overall assessment should remain at the lowest risk levels.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Summary**: The reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code snippet is harmless, and no further action or concern is warranted based on the provided data.",
