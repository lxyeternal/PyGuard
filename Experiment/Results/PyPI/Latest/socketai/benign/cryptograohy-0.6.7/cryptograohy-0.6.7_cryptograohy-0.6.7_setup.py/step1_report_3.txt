{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom post-installation script that installs and uses the 'pyprettifier' library to convert text into emoji format and writes output to files.",
  "sources": "Input source is the code itself; no external data input is explicitly read during runtime.",
  "sinks": "Writing to '/tmp/a' and '/tmp/emoji_output.txt' files; executing 'pip install pyprettifier' via os.system.",
  "flows": "Post-installation, the code installs 'pyprettifier', imports it, creates an EmojiConverter object, converts a string, and writes the result to a file. Errors are logged to '/tmp/a'.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'os.system' to run 'pip install', which is potentially unsafe if input were dynamic; writes exceptions and output to temporary files; runs arbitrary code via 'pyprettifier' after installation; no input validation or sandboxing; potential for code injection if environment variables or dependencies are compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, after package installation, forcibly installs 'pyprettifier' via 'os.system', then imports and uses it to process a hardcoded string. Errors are logged to '/tmp/a'. While no explicit malicious intent is evident, the use of 'os.system' for package installation during setup is risky, as it can execute arbitrary commands if environment variables are manipulated. The code writes to temporary files, which could leak data or be exploited. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, and no network communication or backdoors are observed. Overall, the code executes external commands during setup, which is generally discouraged and potentially unsafe, but it does not appear malicious in intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard setup tasks with a post-install script that installs and uses an external library. It does not contain clear malicious behavior but employs risky practices like running 'pip install' via 'os.system'. Overall, it has a low malware probability but warrants security review due to its use of external command execution during installation.",
