  "purpose": "Initialize and run the CLI function which imports and creates an instance of pyprettifier.EmojiConverter.",
  "sources": "Import statement for pyprettifier and instantiation of EmojiConverter object",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are apparent; no untrusted data handling or output is visible",
  "flows": "Import pyprettifier -> create EmojiConverter instance",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected. The import is within the function scope, which is common and not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library pyprettifier dynamically within the cli() function and creates an object. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The import and object creation appear standard. No hardcoded credentials, code injection, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import and object instantiation with no indication of malicious activity or security risks. It appears benign and typical for CLI setup.",
