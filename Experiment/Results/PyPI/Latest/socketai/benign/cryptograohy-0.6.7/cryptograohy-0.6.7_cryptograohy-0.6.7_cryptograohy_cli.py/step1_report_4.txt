{
  "purpose": "Initialize and run the 'cli' function, which creates an instance of 'EmojiConverter' from the 'pyprettifier' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pyprettifier' and instantiation of 'EmojiConverter' object within the 'cli' function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Import 'pyprettifier' -> instantiate 'EmojiConverter' -> run 'cli' function.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports a third-party package and creates an object but does not perform any operations or utilize the object meaningfully.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a simple function 'cli' that imports the 'pyprettifier' library and creates an 'EmojiConverter' object. It then immediately calls 'cli()'. There are no input sources such as user input, network data, or environment variables. There are no sinks like data transmission, file writing, or system modifications. The code appears minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior. The package 'pyprettifier' may perform some operation, but this code does not invoke any methods beyond object instantiation. No security issues or malware indicators are detected based solely on this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal script that imports a third-party library and creates an object without performing any further actions. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious flows, or security risks observed in this code. It appears benign and serves as a simple CLI setup.",
