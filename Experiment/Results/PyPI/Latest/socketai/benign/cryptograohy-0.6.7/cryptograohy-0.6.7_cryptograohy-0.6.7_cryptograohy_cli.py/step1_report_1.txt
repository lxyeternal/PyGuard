{
  "purpose": "The script initializes an EmojiConverter object from the pyprettifier library, likely for processing or converting emojis.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pyprettifier', and the instantiation of 'EmojiConverter' from the library.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or outputs; the code only imports and creates an object without further actions.",
  "flows": "Import of library -> creation of EmojiConverter instance; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The import is dynamic within a function, but this is not suspicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pyprettifier' library dynamically within the 'cli' function, then creates an instance of 'EmojiConverter'. There are no inputs, network operations, or data leaks present. The library used appears to be a standard open-source package. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident. The minimal and straightforward code does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears benign. It merely initializes a converter object from a third-party library without any malicious or suspicious activity. There are no security risks identified based on this snippet.",
