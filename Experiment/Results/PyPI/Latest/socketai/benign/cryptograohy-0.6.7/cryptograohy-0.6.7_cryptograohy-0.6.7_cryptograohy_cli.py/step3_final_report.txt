{
  "purpose": "Minimal CLI setup that imports a third-party emoji processing library and instantiates an EmojiConverter object.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import of 'pyprettifier' within the 'cli' function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import source to object instantiation; no external data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and object creation.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a third-party library and creating an object without further processing. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The import is dynamic but not suspicious in this context. No data flows, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.05) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence levels are high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behavior. The existing reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
