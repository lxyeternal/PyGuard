  "purpose": "Initialize and run an emoji conversion utility using the pyprettifier library.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pyprettifier' and instantiation of 'EmojiConverter()'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs present in the code.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pyprettifier' -> creation of 'EmojiConverter' instance.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports a third-party library and creates an object without any additional context or input handling; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'pyprettifier' library within a function scope and creates an instance of 'EmojiConverter'. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external data flow, or network activity. The code appears straightforward and is likely intended to perform emoji conversions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, code injection, or suspicious activity. The code structure is minimal and typical for CLI entry points.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI setup that uses a third-party library for emoji conversion. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and intended for utility purposes.",
