  "purpose": "Initialize the package and execute the command-line interface by calling cli() upon import.",
  "sources": "Import statements for .core.greet and .cly.cli; the call to cli() itself.",
  "sinks": "The cli() function, which may process user input or execute commands based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Import of cli() from .cly followed by immediate invocation, potentially processing input or executing commands.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward import and function call without obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports greet and cli functions from local modules and immediately calls cli(), a common pattern for CLI applications. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The security implications depend on the implementation of cli(), which is not provided; however, from this snippet alone, no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The call to cli() could process untrusted input, but without further context, this remains speculative. The code structure is simple and standard for CLI entry points, with no anomalies or signs of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and standard for a CLI package initializer. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily depending on the implementation of cli(). The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is 0. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the typical risk associated with CLI entry points. Overall, the code is safe based on this snippet.",
