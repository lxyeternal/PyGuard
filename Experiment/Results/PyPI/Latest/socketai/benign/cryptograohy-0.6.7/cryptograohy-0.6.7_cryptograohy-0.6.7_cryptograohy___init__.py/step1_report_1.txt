{
  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package and execute the CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing 'greet' from 'core' and 'cli' from 'cly'. Execution of 'cli()' at the end.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'cli()' which likely runs the command-line interface; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; 'cli()' is called immediately, executing the command-line interface functionality.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior. No obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from local modules and then immediately calls 'cli()'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious data flows. The structure is straightforward and typical for a package initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package initializer that imports and executes the CLI entry point. No malicious or security-threatening code is detected.",
