  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing core functions and executing the CLI command.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.core and .cly) and execution of cli() function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of cli() could potentially run external commands or user input, depending on implementation in .cly.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; calling cli() may invoke user interactions or commands that could process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated code detected. The cli() function call is standard for command-line tools.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from local modules and immediately executes cli(). Without the implementation details of cli(), it's unclear if it handles untrusted input securely, but the structure itself is typical for CLI entry points. No suspicious code patterns, no backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initializer that imports modules and runs a command-line interface. No malicious or suspicious behavior is identified based on this fragment.",
