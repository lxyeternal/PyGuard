  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package and execute the CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Import statements for core functions and CLI module, then calling cli()",
  "sinks": "Execution of cli() function, which may perform user interactions or command processing",
  "flows": "Imports are static; cli() is invoked immediately, potentially executing command-line interface logic",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports two components: 'greet' from core and 'cli' from cly. It then calls the cli() function. This appears to be standard package initialization for a CLI tool, with no evident malicious behavior or malicious code execution. There are no external data sources, no network activity, and no suspicious logic observed in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward package setup and CLI invocation with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears benign and standard for a command-line Python package.",
