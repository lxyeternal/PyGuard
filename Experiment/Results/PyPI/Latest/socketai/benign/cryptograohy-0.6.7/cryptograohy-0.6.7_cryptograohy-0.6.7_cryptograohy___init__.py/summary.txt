  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and standard for a CLI package initializer. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily depending on the implementation of cli(). The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is 0. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the typical risk associated with CLI entry points. Overall, the code is safe based on this snippet."
