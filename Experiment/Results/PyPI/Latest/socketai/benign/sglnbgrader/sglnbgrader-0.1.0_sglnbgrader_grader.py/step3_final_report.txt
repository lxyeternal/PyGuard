{
  "purpose": "A Python-based notebook grading system that loads notebooks, extracts cell content, prompts an external LLM API (litellm) for grading, and embeds feedback into the notebook outputs.",
  "sources": "Notebook cells, especially cells marked with 'nbgrader' metadata; external API litellm.completion for grading responses.",
  "sinks": "Embedding feedback as HTML in notebook cell outputs; no data leaks or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Notebook cell content (source) → prompt formatting → litellm API call → response parsing → feedback embedding into notebook outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected. Code is straightforward and transparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard educational tool for grading student responses using an external LLM API. It loads notebooks, identifies grading cells via metadata, constructs prompts, calls the API, parses responses for scores and feedback, and writes feedback into the notebook. No suspicious activities, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The external API usage is typical for such systems, and the code maintains clear data flow and structure. Regex parsing of responses is fragile but acceptable in this context. No hardcoded secrets or environment manipulations are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a transparent, well-structured, and safe implementation of an automated notebook grading system leveraging an external LLM API. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The low security risk score is justified, primarily due to external API reliance, which is standard and not inherently malicious.",
