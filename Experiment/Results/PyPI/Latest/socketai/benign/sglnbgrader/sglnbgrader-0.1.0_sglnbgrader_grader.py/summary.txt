  "conclusion": "The code is a transparent, well-structured, and safe implementation of an automated notebook grading system leveraging an external LLM API. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The low security risk score is justified, primarily due to external API reliance, which is standard and not inherently malicious."
