{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Jupyter notebook grader system that loads, processes, and grades student responses based on an instructor's answer notebook, using an LLM for assessment and providing feedback.",
  "sources": "Reading notebook files via nbformat.read; accessing cell metadata and source; calling litellm.completion for LLM responses.",
  "sinks": "Calling litellm.completion with prompts; processing responses with regex to extract scores and feedback; writing feedback outputs to notebook cells.",
  "flows": "Notebook content and metadata are loaded and processed; prompts are formatted and sent to the LLM; responses are parsed for scores/feedback; results are written back into notebook outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic execution or obfuscation detected. External library usage (litellm, nbformat) is standard for such tasks. No unusual network activity, data leaks, or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive notebook grading framework that uses standard libraries and methods for loading, processing, and grading student submissions. It employs regex for parsing LLM responses, which is a typical pattern, and writes feedback as HTML in notebook outputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system damage, or covert channels. The code primarily performs legitimate data processing, external API calls, and notebook modifications aligned with its grading purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical educational assessment tool with no detectable malicious intent or security risks. It handles data responsibly, uses standard libraries, and does not include malicious behavior or sabotage. The overall security risk is low.",
