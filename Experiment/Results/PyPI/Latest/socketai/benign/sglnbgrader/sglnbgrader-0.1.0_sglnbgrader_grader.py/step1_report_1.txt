{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python class 'Grader' for loading, analyzing, grading, and providing feedback on Jupyter notebooks for a course, using an LLM for automatic grading.",
  "sources": "Reads notebook files via nbformat.read, extracts cell content, reads metadata for grading info, and collects user notebook data for grading.",
  "sinks": "Sends prompts to litellm.completion API; processes and returns grading feedback; writes feedback into notebook outputs; saves feedback notebook.",
  "flows": "Loads notebooks -> extracts answer and student responses -> formats prompts -> calls LLM -> parses responses -> writes feedback into notebook cells.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. Use of external API litellm.com is standard for LLM access. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data processing of notebooks, calls an external language model API for grading, and writes feedback into notebooks. It handles metadata for grade identification, manages multiple cells, and computes statistics for multiple submissions. No malicious activities such as system modification, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. The external API usage appears standard for LLM-based grading, and no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are detected. The functions and data flows align with typical educational grading tools, with proper handling of data inputs and outputs, and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured automated grading tool utilizing an external LLM API. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. All observed behaviors are consistent with its purpose for automated notebook grading.",
