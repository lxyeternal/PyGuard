  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code loads notebooks, extracts cell content, and uses nbgrader metadata. No suspicious activity.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Calls litellm.completion API for grading, writes feedback into notebook outputs.\n- **Anomalies:** No backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The reviewer finds the code to be a standard, well-structured automated grading tool with no malicious intent. The external API usage is typical, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n\n**Assessment:** No issues found; the report is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on reading notebooks, extracting content, and calling litellm.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls and feedback embedding are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate grading system with no malicious features.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Also reasonable, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions—loading notebooks, extracting cell content, calling litellm, and writing feedback.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The reviewer confirms it as a standard, transparent grading system with no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, focusing on grading, feedback, and comparison.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical educational grading tool, with no malicious features.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous, loading notebooks, calling litellm, embedding feedback.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, transparent grading framework.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with prior reports.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is a standard, transparent, well-structured educational grading tool.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware score = 0, obfuscated = 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (0.1), as the code only interacts with external APIs and files in a controlled manner.\n- **Claims Based on Assumptions:** None. All reports rely on code analysis and do not assume malicious intent.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal security concern, mainly due to external API reliance, which is typical for such systems.\n\n**Note:** The code does not exhibit any signs of supply chain attack vectors, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It functions as an educational tool leveraging external LLM APIs.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, transparent, and appropriate for its intended purpose. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
