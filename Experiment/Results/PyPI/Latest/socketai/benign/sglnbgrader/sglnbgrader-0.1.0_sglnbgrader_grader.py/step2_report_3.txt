  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and overall security risk, as well as the reasoning and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a straightforward notebook grading system using nbformat and litellm.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls to litellm, no suspicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. The external API usage is standard, and the code's data flow aligns with its purpose.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Confident (0.9), no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on grading with LLM.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls, embedding feedback HTML.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no backdoors, no obfuscation, and standard external API use.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully confident (1.0), no malware or security issues.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound, and the security risk is minimal. The score aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar grading framework with analysis and statistical benchmarking.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External API calls, statistical analysis.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no backdoors. Uses standard libraries and API.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** The detailed analysis supports the conclusion. No suspicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description, emphasizing standard grading and feedback.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls, feedback embedding.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors. Uses litellm normally.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), no malware or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious behaviors detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, focusing on grading via LLM.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls, feedback embedding.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. Standard external API usage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (0.95), no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's behavior; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious or obfuscated code is detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Consistently low (~0.1), justified by the external API usage and standard data handling.\n- **Scores Justification:** The reasoning is sound, and the conclusions are consistent with the code's structure and behavior.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity or backdoors detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard libraries.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal risk due to external API reliance, but no inherent security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Note:** The code is a well-structured, transparent automated grading system with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, with scores reflecting the absence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low security risk is justified given the external API calls and data handling practices.",
