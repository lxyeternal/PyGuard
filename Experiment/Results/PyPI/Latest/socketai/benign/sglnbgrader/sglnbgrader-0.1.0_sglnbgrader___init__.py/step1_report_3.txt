  "purpose": "Define a module for an LLM-powered Jupyter notebook grading tool compatible with nbgrader.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing the 'Grader' class from the local 'grader' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input points, no output or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up module information and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a docstring describing the module's purpose, a version string, and an import statement. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or handling of untrusted inputs. The import statement is standard and local, importing a class from the same package. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a module initializer with descriptive information and a standard import. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
