{
  "purpose": "A lightweight module that provides an LLM-powered grading tool compatible with nbgrader for Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "The only source is the import statement 'from .grader import Grader'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leak points; no external network or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is minimal and only imports a class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module with a version and imports a class 'Grader' from a relative module. It lacks any runtime behavior, input handling, or data processing. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The only potential concern is if the imported 'grader' module contains malicious code, but this cannot be determined from the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple module initialization with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks evident from this fragment. It is unlikely to be malicious or harmful.",
