{
  "purpose": "Minimal module setup with version info and local import, likely part of a package initialization.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .grader import Grader' as it may load external code if the module is malicious.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; the code does not process input or output.",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines a version string and imports a class.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining a version and importing a local module. No network activity, data handling, or suspicious constructs are present. The import from a local module is standard but could be risky if the module contains malicious code, which cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal package component with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The risk is very low, contingent on the safety of the local 'grader' module, which cannot be evaluated from this snippet.",
