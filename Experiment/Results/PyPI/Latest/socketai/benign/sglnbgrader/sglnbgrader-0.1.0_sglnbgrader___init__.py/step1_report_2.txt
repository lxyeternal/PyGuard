  "purpose": "To provide an LLM-powered Jupyter notebook grading tool compatible with nbgrader.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading functions are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data output, network calls, or external data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is evident in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'Grader' class from a local module, defines a version string, and contains a brief descriptive comment. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution observed. The import statement references a local module, which is typical for package structure and not inherently suspicious. Overall, the code appears to be a standard module initialization snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package module initialization snippet for a notebook grading tool, with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be part of a larger package, with no apparent security concerns based on this fragment.",
