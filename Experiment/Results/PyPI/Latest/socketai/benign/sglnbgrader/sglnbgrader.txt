The external dependencies and the 'grader' module are outside the scope of this review but do not indicate malicious intent based on this code alone. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a transparent, well-structured, and safe implementation of an automated notebook grading system leveraging an external LLM API. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The low security risk score is justified, primarily due to external API reliance, which is standard and not inherently malicious."
