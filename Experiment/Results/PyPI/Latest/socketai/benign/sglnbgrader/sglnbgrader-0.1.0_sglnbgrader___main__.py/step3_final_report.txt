  "purpose": "Minimal CLI entry point that imports and executes 'app' from 'sglnbgrader.cli'.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from sglnbgrader.cli import app'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'app()' when run as main, which may invoke external code.",
  "flows": "Code execution flows from import to 'app()' invocation under '__main__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI entry point that delegates execution to 'app'. No malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are visible here. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'app', which is not provided. The code is minimal, standard, and appears benign. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this assessment. The risk is primarily dependent on the trustworthiness of 'app'.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign and standard; no signs of malicious behavior or security issues are evident. The security posture hinges on the external 'app' implementation. The assigned scores are appropriate given the information available.",
