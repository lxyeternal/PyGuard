  "purpose": "To serve as the CLI entry point for the sglnbgrader package, invoking the application's main function.",
  "sources": "Importing 'app' from 'sglnbgrader.cli', and the 'if __name__ == \"__main__\":' condition.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'app()' which could execute arbitrary code if 'app' is malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "Import 'app' from the package -> check if script is run directly -> execute 'app()' function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward with no hidden or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function 'app' from a module within the package, then executes it if the script is run directly. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior. The security depends on the trustworthiness of 'sglnbgrader.cli.app'. There are no input sources other than the imported function, and the only sink is the invocation of 'app()'. Since 'app' may execute CLI commands, its behavior determines overall safety, but from this code alone, there are no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a typical CLI entry point, delegating execution to an imported 'app' function. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues within this fragment itself. However, the security depends on the implementation of 'app'. Overall, the code appears benign.",
