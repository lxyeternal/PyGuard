{
  "purpose": "Entrypoint for CLI usage of the sglnbgrader package, which runs the main application.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'app' from 'sglnbgrader.cli' and executes it when run as the main module.",
  "sinks": "The code executes 'app()', which is likely a function that starts the command-line interface. No direct sinks for untrusted data are present here.",
  "flows": "The script imports 'app' and calls it if the script is run directly, passing control to the CLI application's internal flow.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "This module serves as a simple CLI entry point, importing the 'app' object from 'sglnbgrader.cli' and executing it. It does not process data directly or perform any operations that could be malicious. The security depends on the implementation of 'app' in the imported module, which is not provided here. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity in this minimal script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point that safely invokes the main application. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet.",
