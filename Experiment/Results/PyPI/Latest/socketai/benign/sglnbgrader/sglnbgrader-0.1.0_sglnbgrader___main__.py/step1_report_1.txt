  "purpose": "Entry point for a command-line interface (CLI) application.",
  "sources": "Importing 'app' from 'sglnbgrader.cli', then executing 'app()' if run as main.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'app()' which executes the CLI application; potential data flow depends on 'app' implementation.",
  "flows": "When executed, the script imports 'app' and runs it, which may process input or data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a CLI application object and executes it if the script is run directly. No input/output handling is visible here, and no external network or file operations are present in this fragment. Since 'app()' is invoked without parameters, security concerns depend entirely on the implementation of 'app'. Without that code, this appears as a standard CLI entry point.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical CLI entry point that delegates execution to an imported 'app' object. There are no immediate signs of malicious behavior or security issues in this snippet. Its security posture relies on the implementation of 'app', which is not provided.",
