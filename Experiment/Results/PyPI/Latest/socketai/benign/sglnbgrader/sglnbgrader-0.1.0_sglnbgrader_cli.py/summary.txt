  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain risks. The external dependencies and the 'grader' module are outside the scope of this review but do not indicate malicious intent based on this code alone. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk."
