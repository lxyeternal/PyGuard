{
  "purpose": "The code implements a command-line tool for grading Jupyter notebooks using an LLM model, supporting both single and batch grading modes with result reporting and saving.",
  "sources": "Paths provided via command-line options (answer, student, submissions, output); filesystem operations (glob, open/write); logging and console outputs.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations for results, console output for logs and progress; loading of external grader module.",
  "flows": "Paths from command-line input are used to load notebooks, which are passed to the Grader class methods for grading; results are collected and optionally saved to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of standard libraries and no dynamic code execution or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles file I/O, command-line argument parsing, logging, and orchestrates grading operations via an imported Grader class. It does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. It securely manages file paths and outputs results locally. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in the visible code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate command-line tool for grading notebooks, with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It operates within the expected scope of file handling and user input processing, without any suspicious activities.",
