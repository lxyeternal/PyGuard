  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for grading Jupyter notebooks using an external 'Grader' class, managing file I/O, logging, and result reporting.",
  "sources": "Reads input notebook files, configuration parameters, and external 'grader' module; no untrusted data sources within this code.",
  "sinks": "Writes JSON results to files, displays output via console; no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input files -> 'grader' methods -> JSON output files and console display; no external untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that orchestrates grading operations by invoking an external 'Grader' class. It handles file I/O, logging, and optional result saving. There are no embedded secrets, obfuscated code, network calls, or malicious behaviors. The external 'grader' module's internal behavior is unknown, but the wrapper code itself appears benign. The use of a configurable LLM model string does not introduce malicious activity. Overall, the code demonstrates standard, safe practices for a grading tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain risks. The external dependencies and the 'grader' module are outside the scope of this review but do not indicate malicious intent based on this code alone. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk.",
