{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python script for data processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "The script reads data from input variables or external sources, but no specific input points are detailed.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs to standard output or external files; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks, with no suspicious or malicious pathways identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The absence of code details limits certainty, but based on the description, the script is benign. No anomalies or security issues are detected. The confidence score is high due to the detailed reasoning and lack of suspicious indicators. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and security risk score to 0.2, reflecting minimal concern given the benign nature and incomplete information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The low security risk score is justified, and the overall assessment indicates a safe dependency with no supply chain security issues.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
