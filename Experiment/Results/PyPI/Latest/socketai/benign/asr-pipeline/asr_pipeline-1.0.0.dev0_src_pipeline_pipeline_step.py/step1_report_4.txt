  "purpose": "Define a base class for audio processing steps that resample audio data.",
  "sources": "Importing torchaudio library and Audio class from pipeline.audio module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations present in the code",
  "flows": "Initialization of Resample transform with input and output sample rates, then applying process method to Audio objects (not implemented here)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard use of torchaudio.transforms.Resample; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code imports a common audio processing library and defines a base class for pipeline steps. It initializes a resampling transform with given sample rates, which is standard in audio processing. The process method is intentionally left unimplemented, suggesting this is a base class meant to be extended. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. No input/output channels that could leak data or execute malicious actions are present. The code appears to be straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless base class for audio processing with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
