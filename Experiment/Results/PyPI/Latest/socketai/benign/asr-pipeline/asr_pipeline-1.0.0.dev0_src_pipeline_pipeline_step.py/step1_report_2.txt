  "purpose": "Define a base class for audio processing steps involving resampling using torchaudio.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'input_sr' and 'output_sr' during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the process method is not implemented here.",
  "flows": "Input sampling rate is used to initialize the Resample transform; process method would handle audio data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports torchaudio and a custom Audio class, then defines a class 'PipelineStep' with an initializer setting up a resampling transformation. The process method is intended to be overridden in subclasses. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or other suspicious activities. The code appears to be part of an audio processing pipeline, with no malicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for an audio processing pipeline with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, intended for resampling audio data.",
