{
  "purpose": "Base class for audio processing, specifically resampling audio signals.",
  "sources": "Input sample rate parameters (input_sr, output_sr), imported torchaudio library.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input handling within this code.",
  "flows": "Initialization of resampler with input_sr and output_sr; process method intended for extension.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation, no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple base class 'PipelineStep' that initializes a torchaudio Resample transform with specified sample rates. The 'process' method is unimplemented, indicating this class is meant to be extended. There are no network calls, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The code uses standard libraries and patterns for audio processing. The overall structure and content are benign and typical for such a component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard base class for audio resampling with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores all at 0. The scores are consistent with the code's nature and purpose.",
