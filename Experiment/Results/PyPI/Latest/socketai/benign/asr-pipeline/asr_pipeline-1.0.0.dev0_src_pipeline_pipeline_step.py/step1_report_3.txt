{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for audio processing steps that resample audio data.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; the class processes 'Audio' objects provided to the 'process' method.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code does not send data outside the class.",
  "flows": "Input 'Audio' object flows through the 'process' method, which is not implemented here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'torchaudio' and a local module 'pipeline.audio'. It defines 'PipelineStep' with an initializer setting up a Resample transform, and an unimplemented 'process' method. No data reading, external inputs, or suspicious behavior are present. The use of 'torchaudio.transforms.Resample' is standard for audio processing and does not indicate malicious intent. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be part of a larger audio processing pipeline and is implemented securely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, standard implementation of an audio processing step with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate component of an audio processing pipeline.",
