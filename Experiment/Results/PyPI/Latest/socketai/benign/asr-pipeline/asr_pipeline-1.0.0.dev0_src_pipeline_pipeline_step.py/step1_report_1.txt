  "purpose": "Define a base class for audio processing pipeline steps that resample audio data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'input_sr' and 'output_sr' for sampling rates.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data output or external network communication.",
  "flows": "Input audio data processed through the 'process' method, which is intended to be overridden.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the torchaudio library and defines a class 'PipelineStep' that initializes a resampler with given sampling rates. The 'process' method is a placeholder for subclasses to implement actual audio processing logic. The use of torchaudio.transforms.Resample is standard for audio resampling tasks. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or other malicious behaviors are present. The class appears to be a straightforward base class intended for audio data processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup for an audio processing pipeline. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be part of a larger framework where subclasses implement specific processing steps.",
