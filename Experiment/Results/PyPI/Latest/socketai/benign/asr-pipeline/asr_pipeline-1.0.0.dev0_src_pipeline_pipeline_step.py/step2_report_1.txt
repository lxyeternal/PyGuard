  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze their assessments:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard implementation of a base class for audio processing, specifically resampling.\n- No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- The use of `torchaudio.transforms.Resample` is common and appropriate for the purpose.\n- The `process` method is intentionally unimplemented, indicating this is a base class meant for extension.\n- No hardcoded secrets, external inputs/outputs, or anomalies are present.\n\n**Issue Confirmation:**\n- The code matches the descriptions; no issues are present in the code itself.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated code.\n- The security risk is minimal, mainly because it's a base class with no direct data handling or external communication.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n- Security risk scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), consistent with the clear, straightforward analysis.\n\n**Potential Adjustments:**\n- The only minor point is the `securityRisk` in some reports being 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, a score of 0 is more appropriate unless there's context suggesting otherwise.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, reflecting the absence of malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scoring is appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard base class for audio processing, with no security concerns.",
