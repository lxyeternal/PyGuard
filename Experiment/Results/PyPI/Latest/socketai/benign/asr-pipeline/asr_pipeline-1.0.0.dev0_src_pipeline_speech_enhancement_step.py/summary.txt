  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an audio processing step for speech enhancement. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The external enhance() function's behavior is assumed safe based on context. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate; the security risk score could be slightly lowered to 0 given the lack of vulnerabilities."
