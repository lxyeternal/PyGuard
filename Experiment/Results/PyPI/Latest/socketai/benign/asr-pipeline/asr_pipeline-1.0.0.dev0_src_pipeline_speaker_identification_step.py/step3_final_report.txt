  "purpose": "Implement a speaker identification pipeline that extracts embeddings from audio data, compares them to known speakers, and updates the speaker list accordingly.",
  "sources": "Audio data input, model.encode_batch output, embedding normalization",
  "sinks": "In-memory storage of speaker embeddings, no external data or network activity",
  "flows": "Audio input -> extract_embedding -> normalize -> compare with known_speakers -> update or assign speaker label",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward and standard for biometric recognition",
  "analysis": "The code extracts speaker embeddings using a model, normalizes them, and compares distances to known speakers using cosine similarity. It maintains a list of embeddings per speaker with a maximum limit, adding new speakers if the distance exceeds a threshold. No external network, file I/O, or suspicious patterns are present. The logic is consistent with typical speaker recognition systems, and no malicious or obfuscated code is evident. The risk is minimal, primarily related to resource management if many speakers are added, but this is mitigated by embedding limits. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of speaker identification with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
