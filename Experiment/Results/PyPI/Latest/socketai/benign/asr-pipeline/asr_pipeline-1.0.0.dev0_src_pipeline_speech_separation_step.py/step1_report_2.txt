  "purpose": "Define a class for speech separation using a specified separation model, resampling audio data, and returning separated speaker audio streams.",
  "sources": "audio.resample(sr, self.resampler), self.separation_model.separate_batch(audio.data)",
  "sinks": "return Audio(speaker1, sr), Audio(speaker2, sr)",
  "flows": "audio data → resampling and separation → separated audio outputs",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden activities detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a class inheriting from a base pipeline step. It performs audio resampling and source separation using a provided model. The process method resamples input audio and applies a separation model to obtain individual speaker signals, which are then wrapped in Audio objects for output. There are no indications of data leakage, code injection, or malicious data handling. The code appears to perform legitimate audio processing functions without suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard audio processing pipeline step with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate component for speech separation tasks.",
