  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the report details step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Review & Logical Analysis**\n\n- The code extends the `stock.scrap` model, adding a `task_id` field linking to `project.task`.\n- The `_onchange_task_id` method updates `location_id` based on the selected task:\n  - It filters `task_id.move_raw_ids` for moves not in \"done\" or \"cancel\".\n  - It then assigns `location_id` to the task's source or destination location.\n- The `_prepare_move_values` method:\n  - Calls the parent method.\n  - Sets the `origin` to the task's name if not already set.\n  - Adds `raw_material_task_id` to the move values.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The line:\n  ```python\n  self.location_id = self.task_id.move_raw_ids.filtered(\n      lambda x: x.state not in (\"done\", \"cancel\")\n  ) and (self.task_id.location_src_id or self.task_id.location_dest_id)\n  ```\n  uses `and` in a way that might not behave as intended. In Python, `and` returns the second operand if the first is truthy, which could lead to assigning `location_id` to either a recordset or a location, depending on the filtered result. Likely, the intended behavior was to assign `location_id` to the filtered move's location, but the current code might not do that correctly.\n\n- No validation exists to ensure `task_id` has valid `move_raw_ids` or that the `location_src_id` or `location_dest_id` are set.\n\n**2. Report Analysis**\n\n- The reports are all marked as `\"error\": \"Empty response\"` with no raw response provided.\n- This indicates a lack of detailed information about the issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n**3. Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Report**\n\n- The reports do not contain any explanation, evidence, or context, making it impossible to verify whether issues are present.\n- The uniform \"Empty response\" suggests either incomplete reporting or missing data.\n\n**4. Scores & Justification**\n\n- Since no specific issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are detailed, assigning high risk or malware scores is unwarranted.\n- The code itself does not appear to contain malware or malicious intent.\n- The only concern is the potential logical bug in `_onchange_task_id`, which is a code correctness issue, not a security vulnerability.\n\n**5. Recommendations & Final Assessment**\n\n- The report's lack of detail makes it impossible to confirm any security issue.\n- The only notable point is the possible logical bug in `_onchange_task_id`.\n- No evidence suggests malicious activity, obfuscation, or high-risk vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (minor logical bug but no security risk)\n\n**Overall,** the reports do not provide enough information to identify any security incident or malicious activity. The only concern is a potential logical bug in the code, which should be addressed for correctness but does not pose a security threat.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Note:** The scores given by the reports are not justified due to lack of detailed information.",
