{
  "purpose": "Extend and customize stock move and stock move line models in Odoo for task and analytic line management.",
  "sources": "User interactions triggering onchange methods, default_get method fetching context data, and model fields with computed or default values.",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate analytic lines, assign task IDs, or update fields based on external data, and actions that prepare reports.",
  "flows": "User or system input triggers onchange or default_get, which may fetch or modify data, leading to analytic line creation or task assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sudo() to bypass access rules in _prepare_analytic_line_from_task; no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious strings, no obfuscated code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on managing project tasks, analytic accounts, and stock moves. It retrieves data from the environment, context, and related models. The use of sudo() is legitimate for ensuring access despite restrictions. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious modifications. The code relies on standard Odoo model methods, computed fields, and context-based defaults. No suspicious external calls, hidden backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present. Overall, the code appears to be standard extension code for task and analytic line management, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension for stock move management in Odoo, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly manages data flow, respects access controls with sudo(), and does not contain suspicious external activity or obfuscated logic.",
