{
  "purpose": "Extend Odoo's stock.move and stock.move.line models to add task-related fields, manage analytic lines, default procurement groups, and facilitate report actions related to project tasks and stock movements.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, context data, database records for tasks, analytic accounts, user info, and related models.",
  "sinks": "Writes to model fields such as name, analytic line values, default procurement group, and report context; creates analytic lines and procurement groups.",
  "flows": "User input or context data (sources) influence field values and analytic line creation; data flows through ORM methods and computed fields to model updates and report actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected. Use of sudo() is standard for permission override, justified within the context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Odoo module extension, utilizing typical ORM patterns, environment, and context data. It manages task linkage, analytic accounting, default procurement groups, and report actions without external communication or obfuscation. Use of sudo() is appropriate for permission management. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The logic is consistent, with proper handling of missing data and standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured extension of Odoo's stock and project modules, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the code's behavior and context.",
