  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential issues, and the scoring assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code extends standard Odoo models (`stock.move`, `stock.move.line`) to add task-related fields and logic for analytic accounting.\n- The code uses typical patterns: `@api.onchange`, `default_get`, computed fields, and ORM record manipulations.\n- Use of `sudo()` is justified for access control, not suspicious.\n- No external network or file system interactions are evident.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present.\n- The purpose appears to be legitimate project and stock management enhancement.\n\n---\n\n### **Specific analysis per report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Extends models for task linkage, analytic lines, and report actions.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior. The low security risk score reflects some internal data manipulation but nothing concerning.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar extension with focus on analytic accounting and default values.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity. The report confirms standard practices.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Adds task and analytic line management, report context.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent; logic is straightforward.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Focus on task, analytic account, and report actions.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No malicious patterns; use of sudo() is justified.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Manage stock moves and analytic lines with default values.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity; code aligns with standard extension practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are consistent with benign, standard code (0).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is appropriate given the internal data manipulations and use of sudo(), which are standard in Odoo modules but still warrant a low security risk score.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity or backdoors detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — reflects minor internal data access and permission handling, typical for such modules.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, well-structured extension of Odoo's stock and project modules, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
