  "purpose": "Static manifest configuration for an Odoo module, defining metadata, dependencies, and data files.",
  "sources": "Module manifest dictionary containing metadata fields, dependencies, data file references, and license info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no user input, no network communication, no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data without data flow or execution paths; purely declarative configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and standard for an Odoo module.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static dictionary serving as a module manifest with no executable logic, user input handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign, declarative nature. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the static, non-executable content. The confidence level is high (1), as the analysis relies solely on static data. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module manifest with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
