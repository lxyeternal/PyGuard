  "purpose": "Configuration metadata for an Odoo module related to project management and stock handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from JSON-like structure, including dependencies, views, demo data, and author/license information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, network communications, or sensitive data handling are present; no sinks detected.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python dictionary containing module metadata such as name, version, dependencies, data files, and author info. It lacks any executable logic, user input handling, or network operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent, and the structure aligns with typical Odoo module manifests. It is purely declarative configuration data.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module manifest with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and typical for an Odoo module configuration.",
