  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing paths identified",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets; import appears standard",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement that imports a local module named 'models'. There are no functions, no external data sources, no network operations, and no apparent malicious code or obfuscated elements. Given the simplicity, it appears to be a standard import statement for modular code organization.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, serving as a standard import of a local module. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are evident.",
