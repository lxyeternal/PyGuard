  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a single import statement: `from . import models` or similar.\n- No data flows, sinks, or external interactions are identified.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical in Python projects.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), except one at 0.9, which is still quite strong.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues:\n- The code snippets are simple import statements importing a local module named 'models'.\n- There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.\n- No vulnerabilities or attack vectors are apparent in such a minimal import statement.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reported issues are **not present** in the code. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing scores and reasoning:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports — correct, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports — correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk:** 0 in all reports — correct, no security issues.\n\n**Potential concern:**  \nWhile the code is benign, the reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is appropriate. The only point to consider is the report with confidence 0.9; the slight uncertainty doesn't warrant a higher risk score.\n\n### Should any scores be adjusted?\n- The scores seem consistent with the code's nature.\n- No reason to increase malware or risk scores.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Note:** Given the simplicity of the code, these scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a straightforward, benign import statement.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code snippet.",
