  "purpose": "The code imports a local module named 'models' using a relative import statement.",
  "sources": "The import statement `from . import models` reads the local module 'models' from the current package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or write to files.",
  "flows": "The source (import statement) loads the 'models' module; no data flows to external systems or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of a local module, with no data processing, external communication, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. Confidence levels are high, with only minor variations. No suspicious behavior, code injection, or malicious activity is evident. The code's simplicity and standard usage confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no security risks or malicious intent. All assessments are accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
