  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports describe a single import statement: `from . import models`. This is a standard relative import in Python, referencing a local module named `models`. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or other logic involved.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior**  \nAll reports agree that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The import is straightforward and typical in modular Python projects.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \nThere are no errors or flaws identified. The code is minimal, and the reports correctly interpret it as a benign import statement.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and transparency.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since no security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are observed.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Inconsistencies**  \nReport 5 assigns a confidence of 0.9 instead of 1, which is slightly lower but still indicates high confidence. Given the simplicity and clarity, a confidence of 1 would be more appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo report makes unwarranted assumptions; all correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Overall Evaluation & Recommendations**  \n- The code is harmless, and the scores reflect that.  \n- The slight reduction in confidence in report 5 seems unwarranted; it should be 1 for consistency.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippet is a standard local import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, with a minor adjustment to report 5's confidence score to 1 for consistency.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The overall malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should be **0**.",
