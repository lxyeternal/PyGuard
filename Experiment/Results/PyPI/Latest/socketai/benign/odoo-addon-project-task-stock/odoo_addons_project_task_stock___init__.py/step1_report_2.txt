  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible due to single import statement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; extremely minimal code",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement that references a local module. There are no input sources, data processing, or external communications. It does not contain any logic, data handling, or potential attack vectors. The minimal nature of this code suggests it is a standard module import typical in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performs a basic import, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
