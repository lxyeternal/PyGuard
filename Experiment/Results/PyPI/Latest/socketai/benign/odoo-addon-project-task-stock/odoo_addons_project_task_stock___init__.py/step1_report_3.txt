  "purpose": "Import the 'models' module from the current package, likely for use within the package or application.",
  "sources": "The import statement accesses the local package's 'models' module.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data output or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads 'models' into the namespace for use elsewhere in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'models' from the current package. There are no functions, variables, or executable code that could lead to data leaks, malicious actions, or security vulnerabilities. Given its simplicity, it appears to be a normal import typical in modular Python code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code is straightforward and typical in Python modules.",
