  "purpose": "Import the 'models' module from the current package",
  "sources": "The code imports a local module 'models' using relative import syntax",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable as this is a simple import statement",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single import statement with no suspicious or unusual features",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal import statement that loads a local module named 'models'. It does not perform any data handling, network operations, or untrusted input processing. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The code is standard and typical for Python projects structured with modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and typical for a Python package. No malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks are evident.",
