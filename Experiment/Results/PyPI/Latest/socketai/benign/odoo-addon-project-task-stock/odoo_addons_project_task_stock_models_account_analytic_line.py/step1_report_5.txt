  "purpose": "Extend the 'account.analytic.line' model to add a link to project tasks and modify post-processing of timesheet values.",
  "sources": "Reading class definitions, field declarations, and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Method super call and modification of the 'res' dictionary within '_timesheet_postprocess_values'.",
  "flows": "The method calls the parent implementation and then alters the returned 'res' dictionary based on filtered records.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious data leaks, or obfuscated code present. The code appears standard for Odoo module development.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an extension of an Odoo model, adding a new relation field and overriding a method to customize behavior. The method logic filters records linked to stock tasks and removes the 'amount' key from the processed data. There are no signs of malicious data handling, network activity, or backdoors. The code operates within the expected framework, modifying specific data in a predictable manner. No unusual language features or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, safe extension of an Odoo module for project and timesheet management. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
