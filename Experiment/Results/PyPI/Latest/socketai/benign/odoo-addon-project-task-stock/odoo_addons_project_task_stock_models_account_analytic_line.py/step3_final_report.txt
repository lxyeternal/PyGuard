  "purpose": "Extend the 'account.analytic.line' model by adding a 'stock_task_id' field and override '_timesheet_postprocess_values' to prevent amount recalculation for records linked to stock tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads 'values' parameter in '_timesheet_postprocess_values' method, accesses 'self' for filtering records with 'stock_task_id'.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the 'res' dictionary by removing 'amount' key for filtered records, affecting post-processing output.",
  "flows": "Source: input 'values' and 'self'; Flow: filtering records with 'stock_task_id' and removing 'amount' from 'res' for those records.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious code, or external data handling; straightforward ORM extension.",
  "analysis": "The code adds a new relation field and overrides a method to customize behavior for stock task linked records. It does not perform any external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious activity. The logic is simple and domain-specific, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk) are justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe customization within the Odoo framework, with no malicious or security concerns. The reports accurately reflect this, and the risk scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
