  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard extension of Odoo's project and inventory modules, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The use of 'sudo()' is typical but warrants cautious permission management. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low risk due to permission bypass practices but no malicious intent."
