  "purpose": "Extension of 'project.task' to manage stock moves, scraps, analytic lines, and related inventory operations within Odoo.",
  "sources": "Reads include move_ids, move_line_ids, stage_id, project_id, picking_type_id, location_id, location_dest_id, and external references for scrap and analytic lines.",
  "sinks": "Methods that update move states, create analytic lines, modify stock move data, and unlink records; potential data leaks or unauthorized actions could occur if permissions are misused.",
  "flows": "Source data (move_ids, stage_id, locations) flows into state transitions, move updates, analytic line creation, and record deletions; notably, 'sudo()' is used in unlink and cancel actions to bypass permissions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'sudo()' in 'unlink' and 'action_cancel' to bypass access rights; no obfuscation, external network activity, or hidden code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Odoo module extension managing project tasks and stock operations. It employs typical ORM patterns, computed fields, onchange handlers, and permission management. The use of 'sudo()' in 'unlink' and 'action_cancel' is common in Odoo to handle permission issues but should be reviewed for security policies. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or external connections are present. The code's structure and logic are clear, with no suspicious behaviors or backdoors. The permission bypass via 'sudo()' slightly elevates the security risk score but remains within acceptable bounds for such modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard extension of Odoo's project and inventory modules, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The use of 'sudo()' is typical but warrants cautious permission management. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low risk due to permission bypass practices but no malicious intent.",
