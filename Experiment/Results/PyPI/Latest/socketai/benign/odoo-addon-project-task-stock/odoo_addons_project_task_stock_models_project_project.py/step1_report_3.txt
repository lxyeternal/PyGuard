  "purpose": "Extend the Odoo project.model to add fields related to stock picking types and locations, and update move info when relevant fields change.",
  "sources": "User-initiated onchange event for 'picking_type_id', and 'write' method which may be invoked during record updates.",
  "sinks": "Method '_update_moves_info()' called on 'task_ids' after location fields are changed, and the superclass 'write' method.",
  "flows": "On change of 'picking_type_id', locations are updated based on default locations from picking type. When locations are changed and saved, '_update_moves_info()' is triggered to reflect the changes in related moves.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code. The code follows standard Odoo patterns for models and fields.",
  "analysis": "The code is an Odoo module extension for project and stock management. It adds new fields and an onchange handler that updates location fields based on selected picking type. The 'write' method overrides the default to trigger move updates when location fields are modified. No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious operations are present. The method '_update_moves_info()' is called, which seems legitimate within the context of stock move management, assuming standard Odoo behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured extension of Odoo's models to enhance project and stock functionalities. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. All operations align with normal Odoo practices. No anomalies or signs of sabotage are evident.",
