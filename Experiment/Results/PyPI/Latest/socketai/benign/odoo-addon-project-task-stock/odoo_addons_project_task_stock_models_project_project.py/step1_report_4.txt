{
  "purpose": "Extend the 'project.project' model in Odoo to include fields related to stock picking types and locations, with onchange behavior to update location fields.",
  "sources": "Reading model fields ('picking_type_id', 'location_id', 'location_dest_id'), and the 'vals' parameter in the 'write' method.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to 'self.location_id' and 'self.location_dest_id', and calling '_update_moves_info()' on 'task_ids'.",
  "flows": "On change of 'picking_type_id', the code updates location fields based on the selected picking type. When 'write' is called with changes to location fields, it triggers '_update_moves_info()' to propagate updates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior present. The code primarily manages data fields and updates related move info in a typical Odoo manner.",
  "analysis": "The code is an Odoo module extension that adds stock location fields to projects and updates related moves upon change. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are observed. No external data is fetched or sent, and no obfuscated code is present. The code aligns with standard Odoo practices, and the functions are straightforward. There are no signs of malware, malicious data leaks, or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Odoo model extension focused on stock management within projects. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The logic is typical for Odoo modules managing stock locations and updates.",
