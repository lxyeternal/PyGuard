  "purpose": "Extension of the 'project.project' model to manage stock picking types and locations, with onchange and write hooks to update related stock moves.",
  "sources": "Reads 'picking_type_id' field, 'vals' dictionary in write method, and default location IDs from picking type.",
  "sinks": "Calls '_update_moves_info()' on 'task_ids' when location fields change, potentially modifying stock move data.",
  "flows": "On change of 'picking_type_id', updates 'location_id' and 'location_dest_id'; on write, if location fields are modified, triggers move info update.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Odoo model extension, utilizing standard ORM fields and hooks. It updates stock move information based on user interactions, which is typical behavior. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to data consistency, and malware presence is absent. The confidence in benign intent and safety is high, with scores aligning accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard extension for managing stock locations within projects. No malicious activity or security threats are evident. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
