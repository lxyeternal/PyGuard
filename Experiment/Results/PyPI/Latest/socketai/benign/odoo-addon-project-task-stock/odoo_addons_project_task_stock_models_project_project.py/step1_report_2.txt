{
  "purpose": "Extend the Odoo 'project.project' model to add fields related to stock picking types and locations, and handle onchange events and write updates for related stock moves.",
  "sources": "User-initiated onchange event '_onchange_picking_type_id' and write method that updates move info; field values such as 'picking_type_id', 'location_id', and 'location_dest_id'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to 'self.location_id' and 'self.location_dest_id' in onchange; call to 'self.task_ids._update_moves_info()' in write method.",
  "flows": "Change in 'picking_type_id' triggers '_onchange_picking_type_id' which updates locations; change in 'location_id' or 'location_dest_id' triggers 'write' method that updates move info via '_update_moves_info()'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow; standard Odoo model extension and method overriding. Domain filter with operator '=?' is standard syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Odoo model extension adding fields and onchange logic to synchronize location data with stock picking types. The 'write' method ensures related stock moves are updated when location fields change. No signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code operates within normal application behavior, relying on standard Odoo framework functions and model relationships.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension of an Odoo model for project and stock location management, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly manages data updates and event handling within the application context.",
