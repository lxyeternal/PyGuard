  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the analysis, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\n# Copyright 2022 Tecnativa - Víctor Martínez\n# License AGPL-3.0 or later (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl).\n\nfrom . import test_project_task_stock\n```\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code is minimal: a license comment and a static import statement.\n- The import is from a relative module within the package.\n- No user input, environment variables, network calls, or dynamic code.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose appears to be part of a larger project, likely for testing or modular design.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import a local module.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious intent, straightforward import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The high securityRisk score (0.9) seems unreasonable. The code is static, simple, and contains no suspicious behavior. The high score should be reduced to reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar import, part of a larger package.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=1\n\n**Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 1 (maximum) is unwarranted given the code's simplicity. Should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Import for testing or project structure.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=1\n\n**Assessment:** Same as above; high securityRisk score is unjustified. Should be 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Part of larger project, possibly for testing.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Benign, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk (0.1) might be due to the module import, but since it's standard, it could be set to 0 for clarity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Standard import.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- All reports correctly assign malware=0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n\n### Obfuscated score:\n- All reports assign obfuscated=0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n\n### Risk scores:\n- The risk scores assigned in reports 1, 2, and 3 are too high given the simplicity and benign nature.\n- The only exception is report 4, which assigns 0.1, which is acceptable but could be zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all, accurate.\n- **Risk score:** Should generally be 0, as the code is benign and static.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code snippet is a simple, static import with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The high security risk scores in some reports are unjustified and should be lowered to zero. The malware and obfuscated scores are correct at zero.\n\n**Final note:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk exists in this code snippet. The scores should reflect that for accurate security assessment.",
