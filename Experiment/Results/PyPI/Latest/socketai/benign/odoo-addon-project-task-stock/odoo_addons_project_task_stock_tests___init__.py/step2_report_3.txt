  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports describe a very simple code snippet: a license comment and a static import of a local module (`test_project_task_stock`).  \n- **Confirmed:** The code does not contain any hidden or malicious logic.  \n- **No issues or vulnerabilities** are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.  \n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.  \n- They correctly identify the code as a standard import statement with no suspicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores Review**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no obfuscation.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.  \n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1. Given the code's simplicity, a 0.1 seems slightly high unless considering potential future misuse, but as it stands, it's still minimal.  \n- **Recommendation:** Keep the malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and security risk at 0 unless further context suggests otherwise.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- No issues warrant a risk score above 0.5. The code is a benign import statement with licensing comments.  \n- The single report with 0.1 security risk is acceptable but could be lowered to 0, given the absence of any suspicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification**  \n- Since the code only performs a static import of a local module, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior, the malware score should remain at 0.  \n- Any non-zero malware score would require evidence of malicious intent, such as code obfuscation, network activity, or malicious payloads, none of which are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as benign and standard.  \n- No overreach or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if a very conservative approach, but 0 is justified here)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward, benign import statement with licensing comments. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk evident. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
