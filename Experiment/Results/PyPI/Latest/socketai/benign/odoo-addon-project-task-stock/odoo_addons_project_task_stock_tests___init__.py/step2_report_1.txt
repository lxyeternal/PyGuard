  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: a license comment and a single import statement of a local module `test_project_task_stock`.\n- No dynamic code, user input, environment variables, network calls, or data flows are present.\n- The code is static and straightforward, typical for Python modules.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are very low or zero, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The import statement is standard and safe.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious logic.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate; no logical errors or reasoning flaws are apparent.\n- The only minor point is the last report's `securityRisk` score of 0.1, which is slightly higher than the others, but given the code's simplicity, this seems unjustified. It should be 0.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or very close; the last report's 0.1 is marginally higher but not justified given the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since the code is purely a static import with no external interactions, the risk score should be **0**. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a simple, benign import statement with a license comment. There are no security concerns, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with the exception of the last report's slightly elevated security risk score, which should be revised to 0.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is consistent with the code's straightforward and harmless nature.",
