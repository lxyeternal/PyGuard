  "purpose": "Import a local module test_project_task_stock as part of a larger project, likely for testing or modular design.",
  "sources": "The import statement from . import test_project_task_stock",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import does not process external input or output",
  "flows": "N/A; static import without data flow or external interaction",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward license comment and a static import statement",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment and a static import of a local module. There are no dynamic elements, user inputs, network calls, or obfuscation. The import is standard for Python modules. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The import statement and license comment are standard and harmless. The assigned scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a risk score of 0, are accurate and justified.",
