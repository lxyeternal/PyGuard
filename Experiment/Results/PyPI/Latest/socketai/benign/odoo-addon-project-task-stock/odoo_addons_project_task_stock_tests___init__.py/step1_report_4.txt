  "purpose": "The code appears to import a module named 'test_project_task_stock' from the current package, likely for testing or development purposes within a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the import statement, which loads a module from the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data outputs, external calls, or untrusted data handling in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a standard import statement with a comment header; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a license comment and a single import statement importing 'test_project_task_stock' from the current package. It appears to be part of a larger module and is likely used for testing or development. No malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is present. The minimal structure and lack of external interactions reduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with a licensing comment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks in this snippet.",
