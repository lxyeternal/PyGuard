  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code content, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines static constants for key mappings (arrow keys, Enter, q, h, j, k, l).\n- Defines color schemes using ANSI escape sequences.\n- Defines some ANSI control sequences for screen clearing and cursor positioning.\n- Provides a help string for navigation instructions.\n- All are static data definitions with no dynamic code, input processing, or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any code that reads input, writes output beyond escape sequences, or interacts with the system beyond static string constants.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None. No network, file I/O, or code execution. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None evident; the code is purely configuration data.\n- **Malware or obfuscation:** Zero. The code is straightforward and standard for terminal UI styling and key mapping.\n\n### Review of each report:\nAll reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, static, and intended for terminal UI styling and navigation, with no malicious or security risks. They assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0, which aligns with the code content.\n\n### Any issues with the scores?\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Correctly 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are detected.\n\n### Any logical flaws or assumptions?\n- The reports assume that static constants and escape sequences are benign, which is correct.\n- No false positives or assumptions about hidden malicious code are evident.\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the detailed analysis, I agree with the provided scores and conclusions. The code is purely static configuration for terminal UI, with no security or malware concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, static, and poses no security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nAccept the current assessments; no further action needed.",
