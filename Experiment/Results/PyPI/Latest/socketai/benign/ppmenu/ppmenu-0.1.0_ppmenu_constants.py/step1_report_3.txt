{
  "purpose": "Defines key mappings, color schemes, and ANSI escape sequences for terminal UI styling and navigation.",
  "sources": "No input sources; all data are hardcoded string constants within classes and variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; code does not process external inputs or perform actions based on external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines constants and static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists of static definitions without obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'dataclass' for structuring constants representing keyboard inputs, color codes, and ANSI escape sequences. All values are hardcoded string literals intended for terminal display and navigation. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no runtime behavior beyond static assignments. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of UI constants for terminal navigation and styling, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
