  "purpose": "Define key mappings and ANSI escape sequences for terminal interface styling and navigation.",
  "sources": "No external input or untrusted data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could cause data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code consists of static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains data class definitions for key codes and color schemes, along with static string constants for terminal control sequences and help text. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no code execution, no network activity, and no manipulation of untrusted data. The code appears to be part of a terminal interface utility, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for styling and user input mapping in a terminal application. No malicious or security-related issues are present.",
