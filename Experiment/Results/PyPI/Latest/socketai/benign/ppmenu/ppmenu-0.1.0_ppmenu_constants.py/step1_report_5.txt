{
  "purpose": "Define key mappings and color schemes for a terminal-based interface.",
  "sources": "None; code only defines constants and data classes with static string values.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external output apart from terminal escape sequences for UI rendering.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static data definitions for key mappings and ANSI escape sequences used for terminal UI. There are no input sources, external data, or dynamic behaviors. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The escape sequences are standard for terminal formatting and do not pose security risks. The overall structure is straightforward, and the code appears to be purely for UI presentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration module for terminal UI rendering and key mapping. There are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
