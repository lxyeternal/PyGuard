  "purpose": "Define constants and data structures for terminal UI control, including key mappings and color schemes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the module imports (dataclasses), and the class definitions with constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only defines static constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely establishes static configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or hardcoded secrets beyond standard escape sequences and key mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for key mappings and color schemes using standard escape sequences. It also includes static string constants for terminal control and help text. All content is static, with no input processing, data handling, or dynamic execution. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be purely configuration for terminal UI, without any network, file system, or privileged operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module for terminal UI, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
