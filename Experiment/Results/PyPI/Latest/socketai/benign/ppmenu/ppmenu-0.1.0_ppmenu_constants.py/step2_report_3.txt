  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports conclude that the code is purely static configuration for terminal UI, involving key mappings, color schemes, and ANSI escape sequences.\n- No input processing, external data handling, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and confidence of 1, indicating they consider the code benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code content:\n\n- The code only defines constants and data classes with static string values.\n- No functions, input handling, network activity, or external data processing.\n- The escape sequences are standard for terminal control, with no signs of malicious manipulation.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, intended for terminal interface styling and key mappings.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n\n- The reports are consistent and thorough; they correctly identify the static, benign nature of the code.\n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n- The assessments align with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\nThese are appropriate given the static, harmless nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- Since the code is purely static configuration with no dynamic or external data handling, a high risk score (above 0.5) would be unjustified.\n- The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent.\n\n### Potential concerns or assumptions:\n\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is straightforward.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a static configuration for terminal UI, with no malicious or security issues.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that static configuration code like this is part of a trusted codebase. In this case, there's no indication of malicious intent or security risk.",
