  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code consists solely of static data class definitions, string constants for terminal control sequences, key mappings, and a help string.\n- There are no functions, input/output processing, external data handling, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The escape sequences and key mappings are standard for terminal UI control.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be part of a CLI application's configuration or UI setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Issues:\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \n- The reports state that the code is benign, static, and purely for UI configuration. This matches the code provided.  \n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic or reasoning?**  \n- No logical errors or mistakes are evident.  \n- The reasoning that the code is benign and purely static is correct.\n\n**Scores assigned:**  \n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities or malicious claims?**  \n- No such claims are made beyond the assumption that the code is benign, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Scores:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward static definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Any reason to adjust these scores?**  \n- No. The code does not perform any actions, data processing, or contain any malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Personal Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, static definitions with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security risk or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a static configuration module for terminal UI, key mappings, and styling.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present.\n- The assessments and scores in all reports are justified and accurate.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0**. The code is benign and poses no security concerns.",
