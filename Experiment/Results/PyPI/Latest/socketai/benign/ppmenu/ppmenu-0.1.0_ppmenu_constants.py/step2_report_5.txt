  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely static, defining constants, data classes, and strings for terminal control sequences, key mappings, and color schemes.\n- No input processing, external data handling, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The purpose appears to be UI configuration for a CLI application.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious behavior:**\n   - The code contains only string constants and data class definitions.\n   - No functions, network calls, file I/O, or dynamic behavior.\n   - No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands.\n   - The escape sequences are standard for terminal control.\n\n2. **Scores assigned:**\n   - Malware: 0 in all reports, which is consistent with the static, benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated: 0, also appropriate.\n   - Security risk: 0, given no active code or vulnerabilities.\n   - Confidence: 1, indicating high certainty of benign nature.\n\n3. **Potential issues or errors:**\n   - The reports are accurate; the code is straightforward and safe.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n   - The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Any assumptions or claims:**\n   - All reports correctly assume the code is purely definitional and safe.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are made beyond what the code shows.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the static, benign nature, **0** is appropriate.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- Since the code is only static configuration, there's no need to increase any scores.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified.\n- No modifications needed; the reports are accurate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No further action required.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code analysis.",
