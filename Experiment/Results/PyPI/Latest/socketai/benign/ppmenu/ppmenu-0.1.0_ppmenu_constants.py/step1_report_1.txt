{
  "purpose": "Defines key mappings, color schemes, and ANSI escape sequences for terminal interface, likely for a CLI application.",
  "sources": "None; all code is static definitions and constants, no input or external data read.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, external output beyond terminal escape sequences, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process or transmit data, only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions, string constants for terminal control sequences, and a help string. No functions, input handling, network communication, or external data processing is included. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation. The static nature and standard escape sequences suggest benign use for CLI interface management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional for terminal interface control with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be a normal part of a CLI application setup.",
