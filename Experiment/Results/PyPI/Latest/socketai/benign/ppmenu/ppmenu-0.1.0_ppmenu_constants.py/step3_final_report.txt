  "purpose": "Define static constants for key mappings, color schemes, ANSI control sequences, and navigation help text for terminal UI styling and navigation.",
  "sources": "Constants and string literals defining key codes, ANSI escape sequences, and help text.",
  "sinks": "None; static data with no data input or output handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward static configuration with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data class definitions and string constants for terminal control sequences, key mappings, and help instructions. There are no functions, input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The escape sequences are standard for terminal UI styling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose appears to be purely for UI configuration in a terminal application. All indicators point to benign static data with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration module for terminal UI, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. All assessments and scores in the provided reports are accurate and appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
