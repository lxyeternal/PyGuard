{
  "purpose": "The code implements a terminal-based menu system with navigation features and customizable display options.",
  "sources": "Reads input characters via sys.stdin.read(), processes menu structure from a provided dictionary, accesses global constants from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses sys.stdin for input; prints output to terminal; calls functions stored as menu item values; reads constants from imported modules.",
  "flows": "User input (source) triggers navigation or activation (sink); menu structure is processed to link keys and quick navigation; menu display functions output to terminal; function callbacks are invoked upon selection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of insecure eval or exec; no obfuscated code detected; menu structure processing includes regex matching but only for label parsing; no suspicious network activity, file modifications, or external communications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code processes a hierarchical menu structure, supporting navigation and callback invocation. It uses standard Python modules and typical terminal I/O methods. No signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors are present. The regex is used solely for label parsing with controlled pattern matching. Menu callbacks are called only within the code's own flow. The overall design appears consistent with a UI library. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on the code provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a terminal menu system with navigation and callback features. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or sabotage. It appears safe and benign.",
