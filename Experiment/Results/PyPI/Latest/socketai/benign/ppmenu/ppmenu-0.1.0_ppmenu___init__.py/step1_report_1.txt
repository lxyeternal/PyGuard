{
  "purpose": "The code implements a terminal-based interactive menu system with navigation, display, and input handling features.",
  "sources": "Reads input from stdin, processes menu structure, and reads constants from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially displays output to terminal, but does not write to files or network; no external data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "User input is captured and used to update menu state; menu items can trigger functions or navigate submenus.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No obfuscated code or external network connections. Use of standard modules (re, sys, termios, tty) is typical for terminal input handling.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a menu structure, processes menu items with optional quick navigation keys, handles terminal input including arrow keys and ALT combinations, and allows navigation and activation of menu items. Menu items can be callable functions or submenus (dicts). The input handling is standard for terminal apps, and no external network or file operations are present. The use of regex for quick key detection is safe and standard. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious backdoors, or hidden code. No suspicious behavior, external communications, or malware patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward terminal menu implementation without malicious intent or suspicious activity. It relies on standard libraries and common design patterns. No malware or security risks are identified. The code appears safe for use.",
