  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a terminal menu system with no suspicious or malicious behavior. Uses standard modules, processes menu items with optional quick keys, handles user input, and executes callbacks.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious patterns, no obfuscation, and no suspicious activity detected. The code's logic aligns with typical terminal UI implementations.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe input handling, standard patterns, and no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (slightly above zero but still low)\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies the benign nature. The slightly higher risk score accounts for potential callback execution, but given the context, it's still low risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** The code processes menu structures, executes callback functions, and handles navigation. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; callbacks are user-defined and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar findings—standard terminal menu with no malicious activity. Uses regex for label parsing, which is safe here.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Straightforward terminal menu, no malicious code, no obfuscation, standard practices.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All report 0, no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly very low (0 to 0.2). Given the code's nature, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical terminal menu system, with standard input handling, menu processing, and callback execution.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious network/file operations.\n- The use of regex for label parsing is safe and common.\n- Callbacks are user-provided functions, which is standard and not suspicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or external communications are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (Code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (Very low, primarily due to the execution of external callbacks, which is expected in such systems but not inherently risky)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and suitable for supply chain deployment. No security risks or malware concerns are evident.",
