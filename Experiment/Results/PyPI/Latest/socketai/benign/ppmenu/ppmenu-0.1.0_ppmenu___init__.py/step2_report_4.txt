  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Confirms that the code is a straightforward terminal menu with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and standard modules.  \n- **Findings:** No signs of malware, suspicious code, or data leaks.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligns with the code's nature.  \n**Verdict:** The assessment appears accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes benign, standard terminal menu code with no malicious activity.  \n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no network activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n- **Comment on securityRisk:** Slightly above zero, possibly reflecting inherent risks in executing user-provided callbacks, but overall low.  \n**Verdict:** Justified and consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, describes a standard terminal menu, with no malicious code, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.  \n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior, no external communications, straightforward callback execution.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Comment:** The minimal securityRisk score accounts for the potential risk of executing external functions, but this is typical and not malicious.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusion—benign terminal menu, no malicious activity, standard input handling, and callback execution.  \n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no network activity, no backdoors.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Comment:** The low securityRisk score is justified given the potential for user-defined callbacks, but overall safe.  \n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Reiterates the benign nature, standard modules, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, and safe processing.  \n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All agree on 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1-0.2), justified by the potential for executing user-supplied functions, but overall low and consistent with benign code.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent in executing user callbacks, but standard)\n\n**Final conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a safe, standard terminal menu implementation with no security concerns or malware indicators.",
