  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest unit tests for the PPM menu navigation class, validating menu structure, navigation, and error handling.",
  "sources": "In-memory data structures, monkeypatched user input via _getch method.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network activity, or file operations; no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input simulation (monkeypatch) to navigation handlers, with no external data flow or output effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; standard test patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward test logic for menu navigation, using fixtures and monkeypatching to simulate user input. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The test suite operates solely on in-memory data and simulated inputs, with no external data or network activity. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (around 0.1), which are appropriate given the context. The 'ALT+h' input is a simulated keystroke, not malicious. Overall, the code is safe, clear, and standard for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for menu navigation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing security scores are appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
