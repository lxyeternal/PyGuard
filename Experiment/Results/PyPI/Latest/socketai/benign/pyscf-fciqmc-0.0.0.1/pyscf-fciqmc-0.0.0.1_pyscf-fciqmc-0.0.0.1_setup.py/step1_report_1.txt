  "purpose": "Define package metadata and setup configuration for the 'pyscf-fciqmc' Python package.",
  "sources": "The entire code primarily reads static data for package setup; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; no potential data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only specifies package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package information. All data is static and explicitly provided. There are no inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a placeholder package with minimal information. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to define package metadata.",
