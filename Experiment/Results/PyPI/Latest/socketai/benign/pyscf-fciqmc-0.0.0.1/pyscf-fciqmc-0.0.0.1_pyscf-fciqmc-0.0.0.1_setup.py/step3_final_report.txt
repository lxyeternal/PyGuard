{
  "purpose": "A minimal setup script defining package metadata for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call, including package name, version, description, classifiers, author, and author_email fields.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or handle external data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields, and the description indicating a placeholder package; these are unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic or external data handling. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, with high confidence. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The placeholder description and empty author fields are benign indicators of a scaffold or template package. The scores are consistent with the code's static, harmless nature.",
  "conclusion": "The package is a benign, static setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores across reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
