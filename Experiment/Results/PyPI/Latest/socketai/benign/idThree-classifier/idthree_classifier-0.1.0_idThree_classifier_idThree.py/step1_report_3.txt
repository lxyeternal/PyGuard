  "purpose": "Implementation of a decision tree classifier using the ID3 algorithm for supervised learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Reading dataset from 'weather.csv' file, importing libraries like pandas, numpy, math, and graphviz.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; the code reads from a local CSV file and uses standard libraries, outputs are only visualization files and printed predictions.",
  "flows": "Reads dataset from CSV → processes data internally for training → generates and visualizes decision tree → makes predictions on dataset.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior observed; the code performs standard data processing, model training, prediction, and visualization tasks without any obfuscated or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a decision tree classifier with functions for entropy, information gain, recursive tree building, prediction, and visualization. It reads data from a CSV file locally, uses standard Python libraries, and generates visualization files. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, network communication, or suspicious data handling are present. The visualization relies on graphviz, which is a standard package for rendering graphs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms. The structure is clear, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an ID3 decision tree classifier for educational or practical use. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It operates solely on local data and produces visual outputs without any suspicious activity.",
