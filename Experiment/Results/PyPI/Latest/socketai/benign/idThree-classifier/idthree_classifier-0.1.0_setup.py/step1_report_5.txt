{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup process for a Python package called 'idThree_classifier', specifying its metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; static package configuration data within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; no external data or untrusted input sources are processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without dynamic data flows or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard use of setuptools for package setup with no obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical package setup using setuptools, reading a Markdown file for description, defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are static, with no external data handling or execution of untrusted code. No hardcoded secrets, malicious patterns, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is safe and performs standard package configuration tasks.",
