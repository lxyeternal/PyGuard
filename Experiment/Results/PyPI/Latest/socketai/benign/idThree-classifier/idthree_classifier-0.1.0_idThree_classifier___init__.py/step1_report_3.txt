  "purpose": "Define and export the ID3Classifier class as part of a package module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module (.id3). No other data sources or input methods are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "Import flow from the id3 module to the current namespace; no data flows or processing paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a sibling module, defines a version string, and specifies exports. There are no suspicious behaviors, no dynamic code execution, no external network access, and no credential handling. The minimal structure indicates a standard package module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal, benign part of a larger package.",
