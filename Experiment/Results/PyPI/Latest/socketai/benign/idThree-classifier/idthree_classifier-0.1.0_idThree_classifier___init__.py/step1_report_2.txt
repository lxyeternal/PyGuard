  "purpose": "This code imports a classifier module and defines metadata for the package.",
  "sources": "The code imports from .id3, which is a relative import within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no input/output operations or data processing is shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of an import statement, a version string, and an __all__ list. It does not include any dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling. The import is a standard relative import of a classifier module, and the rest are simple variable definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a part of a package that exposes the ID3Classifier class.",
