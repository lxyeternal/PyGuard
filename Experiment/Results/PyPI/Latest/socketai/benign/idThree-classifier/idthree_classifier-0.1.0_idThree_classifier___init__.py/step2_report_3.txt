  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is minimal, straightforward, and only involves importing a class from a relative module, defining a version string, and setting an export list. There are no signs of malicious behavior, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. The code appears benign and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is safe, with high confidence (1). Given the simplicity of the code snippet, this assessment is accurate. There are no logical flaws or overlooked issues in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all evidence points to benign, straightforward code with no suspicious behavior, there is no justification for higher risk scores. The current scores are reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions. The malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they are cautious and based solely on static analysis of the code snippet.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional notes:\nGiven the simplicity of the code, there is little room for hidden malicious intent. The only potential concern would be if the imported module `id3` was malicious, but that cannot be determined from this snippet alone. However, based solely on this code, the overall risk remains negligible.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign module setup with no security issues. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
