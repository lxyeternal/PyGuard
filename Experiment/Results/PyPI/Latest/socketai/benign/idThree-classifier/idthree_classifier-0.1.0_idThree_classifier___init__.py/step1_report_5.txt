  "purpose": "The code imports the ID3Classifier from a relative module and defines the package version and exported symbols, likely for a machine learning package.",
  "sources": "The only source is the import statement importing ID3Classifier from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import is static.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. No suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports a class and sets version and export variables. It contains no dynamic or malicious code, no network activity, no data leaks, or backdoors. The minimal structure indicates standard module setup. No anomalies or malicious intent are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as a module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
