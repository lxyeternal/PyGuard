{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports a classifier class (ID3Classifier) from a relative package and defines metadata about the module version and exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own local module files and imports ID3Classifier from a relative path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module, sets a version string, and defines an export list. No dynamic execution, network operations, or suspicious behavior is present. The simplicity and lack of external interactions suggest a standard, benign module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module setup with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
