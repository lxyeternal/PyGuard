  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. Confirm if issues are present:\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal, straightforward, and only performs a relative import, defines a version string, and an __all__ list.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling.\n- No untrusted input or output is involved.\n- The code appears to be a standard module setup for a package.\n\n2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. Review of scores:\n- All reports assign confidence = 1, obfuscated = 0, malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- These scores are consistent with the analysis: the code is simple, non-malicious, and no suspicious behavior is observed.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all evidence points to benign, static import statements with no suspicious behavior, the risk score should remain at 0.\n- The malware score is also 0, which is justified given the lack of any malicious activity.\n\n5. Malware considerations:\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing arbitrary code, network access, or data exfiltration.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. Challenging assumptions:\n- The assumption that this code is benign is supported by the analysis; there are no suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions beyond what the code shows.\n\n7. Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a minimal, benign module setup with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Note:** No further action needed.",
