{
  "purpose": "This code defines a minimal Python module that imports a class from a relative module, sets a version string, and specifies exportable symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .id3 module, version string assignment, __all__ list definition",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or outputs are present",
  "flows": "Import from .id3 -> module namespace; version and __all__ are static assignments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard, with no suspicious constructs or obfuscated patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup with a relative import, version info, and export list. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. No suspicious behavior or security issues are evident. The only potential concern would be the integrity of the imported module, but that cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
