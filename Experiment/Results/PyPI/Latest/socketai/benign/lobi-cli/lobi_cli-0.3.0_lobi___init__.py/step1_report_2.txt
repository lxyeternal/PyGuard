  "purpose": "This code imports classes from the 'lobi' package, likely for memory management, core functionality, and auxiliary tools.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'lobi' package modules: memory, lobi, and tools.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted input-to-output paths identified in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements from an external package 'lobi'. There is no executable code, data processing, or input/output handling shown. The imported classes seem to be for memory, core functionality, and tools, which are typical in modular packages. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided import statements, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be a standard import setup for a Python project using the 'lobi' package. No malicious activity or suspicious patterns are detectable.",
