{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes from the 'lobi' package, likely for memory management, core functionality, and utility tools.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'lobi.memory', 'lobi.lobi', and 'lobi.tools'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not perform actions or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond imports; no further code provided.",
  "anomalies": "Only import statements, no suspicious or anomalous code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a third-party package named 'lobi'. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or other actions that could be malicious. Since the code is limited to imports, it does not contain any evident malicious behavior or security risks. The imported modules may contain malicious code, but based on the provided snippet, there's no indication of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment only performs import statements, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard import setup from a third-party library, with no suspicious behavior.",
