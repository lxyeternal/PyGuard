{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules from the 'lobi' package, likely to utilize memory, core functionalities, and tools provided by this package.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load modules from 'lobi' package components.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly visible; imports suggest usage of functions or classes but no actual data flow is demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "Imports are from a third-party package 'lobi'; without further context, this appears standard. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from the 'lobi' package, indicating setup for further operations. No input reading, data handling, or execution of untrusted code is evident. The package 'lobi' appears to be a known library, and no malicious or suspicious behavior can be inferred solely from these imports. The code structure is straightforward and lacks complexity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, merely importing modules for subsequent use. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or security risks at this stage.",
