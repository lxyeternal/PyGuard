  "purpose": "Import statements for modules related to memory, core functionality, and tools from the 'lobi' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements at the beginning of the code, which load specific classes or functions from external modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in these import statements; they only load modules and do not execute untrusted code or handle data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows are established in these import statements; they merely import modules for later use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are present in these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, which are standard in Python to include external modules or classes. These imports do not execute any untrusted code or perform any malicious actions by themselves. There is no indication of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues within these import statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code only imports specific classes from the 'lobi' package and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard setup for further code that likely utilizes these modules.",
