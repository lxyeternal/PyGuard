      "conclusion": "The setup.py executes an external bootstrap function during installation, which could be malicious if compromised. No suspicious code patterns are present in the script itself. The main concern is the trustworthiness of bootstrap_lobienv(). The scores should reflect moderate risk and low malware likelihood unless further inspection reveals malicious content."

      "conclusion": "The script is a benign environment bootstrapper with no malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The supply chain risk is inherent but not specific to this code. The assigned scores are appropriate; a slight elevation of the risk score to 0.2 is justified to reflect typical supply chain concerns, but malware and obfuscation scores remain at 0."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions enabling powerful operations, including arbitrary code and command execution. While no malicious payloads or backdoors are present, its capabilities pose significant security risks if inputs are untrusted or improperly validated. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.7, reflecting the potential for misuse rather than embedded malicious code."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The script itself is benign and well-structured, serving as a wrapper for AI interactions. Its primary security concern is the potential for executing malicious or unvalidated code generated by the AI, which could lead to system compromise if not sandboxed or sanitized. Therefore, the malware and obfuscation scores are 0, but the overall security risk should be considered high (~0.75) due to the inherent danger of dynamic code execution without validation."
