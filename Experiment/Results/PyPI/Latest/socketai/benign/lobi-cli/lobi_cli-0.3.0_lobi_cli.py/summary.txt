  "conclusion": "The script itself is benign and well-structured, serving as a wrapper for AI interactions. Its primary security concern is the potential for executing malicious or unvalidated code generated by the AI, which could lead to system compromise if not sandboxed or sanitized. Therefore, the malware and obfuscation scores are 0, but the overall security risk should be considered high (~0.75) due to the inherent danger of dynamic code execution without validation."
