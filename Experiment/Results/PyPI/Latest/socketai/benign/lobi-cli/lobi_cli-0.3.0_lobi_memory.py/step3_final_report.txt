{
  "purpose": "Implement a long-term memory system using OpenAI embeddings, JSON storage, and FAISS for similarity search.",
  "sources": "Reading input text for embedding, loading and saving JSON file, creating embeddings via OpenAI API, and indexing with FAISS.",
  "sinks": "API responses containing embeddings, file operations writing memory data, FAISS search results retrieving memory entries.",
  "flows": "Input text -> _embed() -> OpenAI API response -> stored in memory -> _build_index() -> FAISS index -> search query -> FAISS search -> results -> retrieve from memory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. The code uses standard API calls and file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code loads memory data from a JSON file, generates embeddings for new entries via OpenAI API, normalizes vectors, builds a FAISS index for similarity search, and allows adding, purging, and searching memory. No malicious or suspicious activity is present; the API usage appears standard. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature and external API reliance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a memory system utilizing OpenAI embeddings and FAISS. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
