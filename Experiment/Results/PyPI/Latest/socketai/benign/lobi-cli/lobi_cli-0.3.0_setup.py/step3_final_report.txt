  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package, executing an external bootstrap function during installation, which could pose supply chain risks if malicious.",
  "sources": "Import and execution of bootstrap_lobienv() from lobi.bootstrap during setup.",
  "sinks": "Execution of bootstrap_lobienv() potentially runs arbitrary code, which could lead to malicious actions such as code execution or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Import of bootstrap_lobienv() -> execution within try-except block during setup -> potential malicious code runs if bootstrap_lobienv() is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of external bootstrap code during setup without validation; reading README.md is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py is a typical packaging script that imports and executes bootstrap_lobienv() during installation, which is a supply chain concern if the function contains malicious code. No obfuscation or secrets are present. The risk depends on the trustworthiness of bootstrap_lobienv(). The code itself is straightforward, but executing external code at install time is a known vector for malicious activity. The reports correctly identify this risk. Without inspecting bootstrap_lobienv(), the risk remains theoretical but plausible. The malware score is appropriately low to moderate, reflecting potential but unconfirmed malicious behavior. The security risk score is moderate, acknowledging the danger of executing external code during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py executes an external bootstrap function during installation, which could be malicious if compromised. No suspicious code patterns are present in the script itself. The main concern is the trustworthiness of bootstrap_lobienv(). The scores should reflect moderate risk and low malware likelihood unless further inspection reveals malicious content.",
