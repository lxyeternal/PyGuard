  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the core concern is the invocation of `bootstrap_lobienv()` during setup.\n- The code snippet confirms that `bootstrap_lobienv()` is imported and executed within a try-except block, which is accurate.\n- Reading `README.md` for `long_description` is standard practice; no issues there.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly note that executing `bootstrap_lobienv()` during setup could be risky if the function is malicious.\n- They also mention that reading `README.md` is typical and less risky, which is accurate.\n- No major logical errors are apparent; they appropriately highlight that the risk hinges on the implementation of `bootstrap_lobienv()`.\n\n**3. Scores review:**\n- **Malware score (~0.2–0.3):** Given that `bootstrap_lobienv()` is executed during setup and could contain malicious code, a malware score of around 0.2–0.3 seems reasonable, especially without inspecting the function.\n- **Obfuscated score (~0):** No obfuscation detected; code appears straightforward.\n- **Risk score (~0.3–0.5):** The scores reflect some concern but are not extremely high, which aligns with the analysis that execution of arbitrary code during setup is a supply chain risk but not necessarily malicious.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- The reports do not assign scores above 0.5, which is appropriate unless there is concrete evidence of malicious behavior.\n- Since the risk depends on the actual content of `bootstrap_lobienv()`, and no such content is provided, higher scores would be speculative.\n\n**5. Malware score justification:**\n- The malware scores (0.2–0.3) are justified because executing an external bootstrap function during setup can be exploited to run malicious code if the function is compromised.\n- Without inspecting the function's code, the scores are appropriately cautious but not overly alarmist.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- The reports do not assume maliciousness without evidence; they appropriately state that malicious behavior depends on the content of `bootstrap_lobienv()`.\n- They highlight that execution during setup is a potential vector but do not assert maliciousness outright.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the reports:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis—moderate malware risk, some security concern due to dynamic code execution, but no concrete evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** ~0.2 (consistent with the reports; execution of external code during setup is a risk but not confirmed malicious)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** ~0.4 (moderate risk due to dynamic execution during setup, but not inherently malicious)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe main concern is the execution of `bootstrap_lobienv()` during installation, which could be exploited if malicious. However, in the absence of concrete evidence of malicious code, the scores are appropriately cautious but not overly severe. The reports correctly identify the potential supply chain risk without overstating the threat.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Verify the contents of `lobi.bootstrap.bootstrap_lobienv()` before installation.\n- Consider removing or deferring the bootstrap call to a safer point in the process.\n- Maintain the current scores unless further evidence suggests malicious intent.",
