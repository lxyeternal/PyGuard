  "conclusion": "The setup.py executes an external bootstrap function during installation, which could be malicious if compromised. No suspicious code patterns are present in the script itself. The main concern is the trustworthiness of bootstrap_lobienv(). The scores should reflect moderate risk and low malware likelihood unless further inspection reveals malicious content."
