  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code and considering the security implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports identify the core concern: the execution of `bootstrap_lobienv()` during setup.\n- The function `bootstrap_lobienv()` is imported from `lobi.bootstrap` and invoked during setup, which is atypical and potentially risky.\n- Reading `README.md` is standard and unlikely malicious unless the file itself is tampered with, which is less concerning.\n- The code does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns beyond the bootstrap invocation.\n- The main risk hinges on the contents and behavior of `bootstrap_lobienv()`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Code Validity\n- The code snippets match the description: `from lobi.bootstrap import bootstrap_lobienv` and its invocation.\n- The `try-except` block ensures errors in bootstrap don't halt setup but do not prevent malicious execution.\n- No anomalies in the code structure itself; the concern is external code execution.\n\n### Error & Flaws\n- The reports correctly identify that executing `bootstrap_lobienv()` during setup can be dangerous if malicious.\n- No issues with reading `README.md`; it's standard practice.\n- No logical errors or code flaws are evident; the concern is the external function.\n\n### Score Justifications\n- **Malware Score (~0.2 - 0.3):**  \n  The reports assign malware scores around 0.2-0.3, citing potential malicious code in `bootstrap_lobienv()`. This is reasonable given the uncertainty. Without inspecting `lobi.bootstrap`, we can't confirm maliciousness, but the risk is present.\n\n- **Security Risk Score (~0.3 - 0.5):**  \n  The scores reflect moderate concern, which is appropriate. The highest assigned is 0.5, which seems justified if `bootstrap_lobienv()` is malicious.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):**  \n  Correct, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n### Critical Evaluation\n- The reports do not assume maliciousness without evidence but acknowledge the risk inherent in executing external code during setup.\n- The scores are consistent with the described behavior and potential threat.\n\n### Recommendations\n- **Risk higher than 0.5?**  \n  Not justified unless `bootstrap_lobienv()` is confirmed malicious. Given the current info, scores should stay at or below 0.5.\n\n- **Potential for malicious activity:**  \n  The main concern is the execution of `bootstrap_lobienv()`. If the function is benign, the risk is minimal; if malicious, it could be severe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\nBased on all reports and the code, my own estimates are:\n\n| Metric             | Score (0 to 1) | Justification                                                                                     |\n|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**       | **0.2**        | Potential malicious code in `bootstrap_lobienv()`, but unverified.                            |\n| **Obfuscated**    | **0**          | No obfuscation detected.                                                                         |\n| **Risk**          | **0.4**        | Moderate risk due to execution during setup; depends on `bootstrap_lobienv()`'s integrity.     |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe core concern is executing external bootstrap code during setup, which could be malicious if the source is compromised. The current scores in the reports are reasonable, but without inspecting `lobi.bootstrap`, the actual risk remains uncertain.\n\n**Final note:**  \nIt is advisable to review the implementation of `bootstrap_lobienv()` before deploying or distributing this package to mitigate potential supply chain risks.",
