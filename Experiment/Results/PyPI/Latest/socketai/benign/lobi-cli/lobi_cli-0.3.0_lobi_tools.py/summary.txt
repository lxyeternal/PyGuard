  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions enabling powerful operations, including arbitrary code and command execution. While no malicious payloads or backdoors are present, its capabilities pose significant security risks if inputs are untrusted or improperly validated. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.7, reflecting the potential for misuse rather than embedded malicious code."
