  "conclusion": "The script is a benign environment bootstrapper with no malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The supply chain risk is inherent but not specific to this code. The assigned scores are appropriate; a slight elevation of the risk score to 0.2 is justified to reflect typical supply chain concerns, but malware and obfuscation scores remain at 0."
