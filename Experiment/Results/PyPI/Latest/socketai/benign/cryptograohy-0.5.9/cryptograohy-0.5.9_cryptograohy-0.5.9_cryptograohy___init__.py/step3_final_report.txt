  "purpose": "Simple package initializer importing a function from a local module",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core module",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward import",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports a function 'greet' from the '.core' module. It contains no data flows, input handling, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The import is static and standard, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions suggest a benign purpose. Scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package initialization with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and reasoning are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
