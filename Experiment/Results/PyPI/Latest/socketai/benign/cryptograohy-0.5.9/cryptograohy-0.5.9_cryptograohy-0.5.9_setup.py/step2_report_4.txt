  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a setup.py with a custom install command that imports 'pyprettifier' during post-install.\n- The package name 'cryptograohy' appears misspelled, which could be accidental or intentional (e.g., to evade detection).\n- The code's core functionality is to fetch dependencies and then import 'pyprettifier' and instantiate 'EmojiConverter'.\n- No explicit malicious behaviors (network activity, data exfiltration, code injection) are reported or observed.\n- The 'malware' score is consistently 0 across reports, and 'securityRisk' is low (0.2), indicating minimal concern.\n- The 'obfuscated' score is 0, suggesting the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity of Issues:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** The code matches the description; no discrepancies.\n- **Errors or flaws:** Use of internal method `fetch_build_eggs` is standard but somewhat unconventional; no security flaw.\n- **Malicious code or behavior:** None detected. Importing 'pyprettifier' post-install is normal, assuming 'pyprettifier' is benign.\n- **Suspicious anomalies:** The misspelling of the package name is suspicious but not malicious on its own.\n- **Dynamic import and execution during setup:** Common in some setup scripts, not inherently malicious.\n\n### Scoring justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity observed.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, reflecting minor concerns mainly due to package name typo and unconventional import timing, but no real security threat.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No report overstates the risk; the lowest scores are justified.\n- The potential concern is the delayed import of 'pyprettifier', which could be exploited if 'pyprettifier' were malicious, but this is speculative and not evidenced here.\n- The package name typo is likely accidental, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (appropriate given the minor anomaly but no real threat)\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign scores based solely on the provided data, I would keep them as is, considering the benign nature of the code and the lack of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard setup script with a custom post-install step.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- The minor typo in the package name is likely unintentional.\n- The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The package appears safe, with no immediate security concerns. The scores should remain low, with the malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and the risk score at 0.2 to reflect minor anomalies.",
