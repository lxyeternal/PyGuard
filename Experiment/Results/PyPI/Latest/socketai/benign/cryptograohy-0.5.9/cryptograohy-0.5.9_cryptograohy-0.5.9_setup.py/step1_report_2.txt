{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'cryptograohy', including a custom post-installation command that installs dependencies and executes additional code.",
  "sources": "The code reads input and dependencies from 'install_requires', package metadata, and imports within the custom install command.",
  "sinks": "The code executes 'import pyprettifier' after dependency installation and runs a post-install action, but there are no direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method fetches build eggs, then executes '_post_install_action' which imports 'pyprettifier' and initializes 'EmojiConverter', but does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'cryptograohy' appears misspelled, possibly a typo but not malicious. The 'PostInstallCommand' uses 'self.distribution.fetch_build_eggs', which is an internal method; no obfuscation or malicious code apparent. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup process with a custom install command that ensures dependencies are installed before executing a post-install function. The post-install code imports 'pyprettifier' and initializes an 'EmojiConverter', which appears to be benign. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. The only concern might be the use of internal 'fetch_build_eggs', but this is standard in setup scripts for dependency management. The misspelling of the package name is likely a typo and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a custom install step. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The only minor issue is the misspelling of the package name, which seems accidental. Overall, the code is safe.",
