{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'cryptograohy', including a custom post-install command that imports 'pyprettifier' and initializes an emoji converter.",
  "sources": "The code reads data during dependency fetching with 'fetch_build_eggs' and during the post-install method where 'pyprettifier' is imported.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not perform data leaks, network calls, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The dependency fetch occurs first; then during post-install, 'pyprettifier' is imported, and 'EmojiConverter' is instantiated, with no further data flow or malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual delayed import of 'pyprettifier' during post-install; package name 'cryptograohy' appears misspelled; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures with a custom post-install step. The delayed import of 'pyprettifier' is typical in setup scripts to avoid dependency issues. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. The misspelling of the package name is likely a typo. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9) are consistent with the benign analysis. The only minor concern is the import timing and package name typo, which do not constitute security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with a custom post-install step that imports a harmless dependency. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. The minor anomalies (import timing and typo) do not impact security. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
