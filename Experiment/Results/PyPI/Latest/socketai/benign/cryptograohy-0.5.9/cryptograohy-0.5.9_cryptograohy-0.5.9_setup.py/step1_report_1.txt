  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'cryptograohy', including a custom post-installation command.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'install_requires' and environment during installation, as well as the 'cryptograohy.cli:cli' entry point.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import of 'pyprettifier' in post-install, potential execution of code during setup, network operations if 'pyprettifier' or other dependencies perform them.",
  "flows": "Installation process reads 'install_requires', then executes 'PostInstallCommand.run', which fetches build eggs and calls '_post_install_action', importing 'pyprettifier' and creating an 'EmojiConverter' object.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom post-install command to import 'pyprettifier' after installation, potential for code execution during package installation, but no explicit malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration with a custom install command that fetches dependencies and then imports 'pyprettifier' post-install. The import occurs during setup, which is standard for some setup scripts, and 'pyprettifier' appears to be a benign dependency aimed at emoji processing. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code behavior are evident. The package name has a typo 'cryptograohy' which might be benign or malicious, but no direct malicious intent is visible. The code does not perform any unauthorized data access, code injection, or harmful actions. The import of 'pyprettifier' after installation is a normal pattern for delayed imports. Overall, the code appears to be a benign setup script with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a custom post-install step that imports a dependency. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. The package seems intended for emoji-related functionality, and no malicious code or data exfiltration is detected.",
