  "purpose": "A simple CLI script that imports the 'pyprettifier' package and creates an 'EmojiConverter' instance, handling exceptions by printing errors.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pyprettifier' and instantiation of 'EmojiConverter'.",
  "sinks": "Printing exception messages to standard output.",
  "flows": "Import 'pyprettifier' -> instantiate 'EmojiConverter' -> catch and print exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party package and creates an object from it, with broad exception handling. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are present. The exception handling is minimal but not malicious. The reliance on 'pyprettifier' is a trust concern but does not reflect in the code itself. The code is clear, simple, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of the external package, which cannot be assessed here. The scores are consistent with the analysis, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1).",
