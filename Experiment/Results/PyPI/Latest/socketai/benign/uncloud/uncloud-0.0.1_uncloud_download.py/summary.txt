  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for downloading and verifying files from cloud storage services. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of browser automation for OneDrive is appropriate for complex download flows. The inactive subprocess code is a minor concern but currently harmless. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for supply chain use with minimal risk."
