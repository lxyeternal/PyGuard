      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for downloading and verifying files from cloud storage services. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of browser automation for OneDrive is appropriate for complex download flows. The inactive subprocess code is a minor concern but currently harmless. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for supply chain use with minimal risk."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is vulnerable to command injection due to unsafe subprocess calls with untrusted filename inputs. While no malicious activity is present, the security risk is significant and should be mitigated by avoiding `shell=True` or sanitizing inputs. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.75."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions as a utility wrapper for downloading and extracting archives. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of external functions, which cannot be assessed here. Based solely on this snippet, the malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting reliance on external dependencies but no inherent vulnerabilities."
