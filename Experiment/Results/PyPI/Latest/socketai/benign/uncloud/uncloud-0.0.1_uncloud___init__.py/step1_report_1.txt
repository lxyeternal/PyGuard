  "purpose": "This module re-exports functions 'download_and_extract_archive' and 'uncloud' from a local module '.uncloud', likely for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.uncloud'. No external data inputs or untrusted sources are read within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input, environment variables, or external systems are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, with no apparent anomalies or suspicious activity. It only re-exports functions from another module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a relative module and defines an __all__ list for exports. It lacks any data processing, input handling, or execution logic. Without additional context or the implementation of 'download_and_extract_archive' and 'uncloud', no malicious activity or security issues can be inferred. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module re-exporting functions with no malicious intent or security risks evident from the provided code. No anomalies, malware, or security issues are detected.",
