  "purpose": "Re-export functions from the local module '.uncloud' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .uncloud module",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "Import from '.uncloud' to exported namespace via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export with no suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a local module and exposes them via __all__, serving as a re-export module. It contains no data processing, input handling, network communication, or obfuscation. No malicious or security-sensitive operations are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate a benign purpose. The imported functions are outside the scope of this snippet and could potentially contain issues, but based solely on this code, no risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard re-export module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All signals point to benign intent, and the scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with minimal security risk.",
