{
  "purpose": "The code exports functions 'download_and_extract_archive' and 'uncloud' from a local module, likely for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports from a relative module '.uncloud' to access specific functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module to the module's namespace and then potentially to external modules via exports, but no untrusted data sources or sinks are explicitly used here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with a standard import and export statement. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a straightforward re-export of functions from a local module. It does not contain any logic, input handling, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident. Since it relies on local module imports, any malicious behavior would originate from the 'uncloud' module itself, which is outside this code fragment. Based solely on this snippet, there are no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple re-export module with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard packaging code to expose specific functions externally.",
