{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to download and extract archives from cloud services, orchestrating external download and extraction routines.",
  "sources": "User-controlled inputs such as URLs, filenames, paths, and checksums; external functions 'download_archive' and 'extract_archive'.",
  "sinks": "External functions handling network and file operations; potential points where untrusted data could cause issues if those functions are insecure.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into external functions; external functions process network download and file extraction based on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; straightforward utility wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple orchestrator delegating download and extraction tasks to external modules. It accepts user inputs and flags, with no internal malicious logic. The security depends on the trustworthiness of external functions. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code's structure is clear and standard for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions as a utility wrapper for downloading and extracting archives. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of external functions, which cannot be assessed here. Based solely on this snippet, the malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting reliance on external dependencies but no inherent vulnerabilities.",
