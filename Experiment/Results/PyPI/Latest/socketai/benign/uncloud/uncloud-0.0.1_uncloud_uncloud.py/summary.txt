  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions as a utility wrapper for downloading and extracting archives. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of external functions, which cannot be assessed here. Based solely on this snippet, the malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting reliance on external dependencies but no inherent vulnerabilities."
