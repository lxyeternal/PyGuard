  "purpose": "CLI wrapper that collects user input parameters for downloading, verifying, and extracting cloud-stored archives, passing them to the 'uncloud' function.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments (URL, filename, hash, extraction options, etc.)",
  "sinks": "The 'uncloud' function, which handles download, verification, extraction, and cleanup operations",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed from CLI are passed directly to 'uncloud' without internal validation or sanitization",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected; code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple argument parser that forwards parameters to an external 'uncloud' module. No internal network activity, data handling, or security-sensitive operations are performed within this snippet. The security and maliciousness depend entirely on 'uncloud's implementation. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present in this wrapper. The scores assigned by reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and external dependency. The main concern is trusting 'uncloud', but the wrapper itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI interface with no malicious or obfuscated elements. Security risks are minimal and primarily depend on the external 'uncloud' module. No changes to the scores are necessary; the current assessment accurately reflects the code's safety.",
