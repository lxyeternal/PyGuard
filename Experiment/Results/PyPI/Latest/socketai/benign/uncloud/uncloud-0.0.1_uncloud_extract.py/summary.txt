  "conclusion": "The code is vulnerable to command injection due to unsafe subprocess calls with untrusted filename inputs. While no malicious activity is present, the security risk is significant and should be mitigated by avoiding `shell=True` or sanitizing inputs. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.75."
