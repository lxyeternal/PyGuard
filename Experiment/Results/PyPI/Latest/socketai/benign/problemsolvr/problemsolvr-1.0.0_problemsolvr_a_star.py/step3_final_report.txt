  "purpose": "Implementing the A* pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph with heuristic guidance.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: graph structure, start node, goal node, heuristic function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data output or network operations",
  "flows": "Graph data flows from input parameters; heuristic function influences node scoring; path is constructed incrementally",
  "anomalies": "Timing measurement used solely for performance profiling; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, correct implementation of A* search. It reads graph data, maintains open set with a heap, updates g-scores, and constructs paths. No external system calls, network activity, or insecure data handling are present. The timing code is harmless. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified. The heuristic is externally provided, which is typical and not suspicious. The code's structure and behavior align with expected pathfinding logic, and no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of the A* algorithm with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a minimal security risk score of 0.1 due to timing measurement, which is harmless. No modifications are necessary.",
