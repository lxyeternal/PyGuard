  "purpose": "Implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm for graph traversal.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'graph', 'start', 'goal', 'heuristic'; internally, no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable access present.",
  "flows": "Input 'graph' is read to obtain neighbors; 'heuristic' function is called for each neighbor; internal data structures (open_set, g_score, path) are used for computations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no obfuscated code features; no unusual behaviors or hidden functionalities detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard A* search: initializing open set, calculating tentative g-scores, updating paths, and using a heuristic function. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks observed. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic present. The implementation appears straightforward and typical for A* pathfinding algorithms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of the A* algorithm with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It serves its purpose of pathfinding without evident security risks.",
