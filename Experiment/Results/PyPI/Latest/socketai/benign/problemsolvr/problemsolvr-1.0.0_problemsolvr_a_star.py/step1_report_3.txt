{
  "purpose": "Implements the A* pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph using heuristics.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'graph', 'start', 'goal', 'heuristic'; reads data from 'graph' structure within the function.",
  "sinks": "Returns a dictionary with the computed path, steps, and timing; no untrusted data sinks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Reads 'graph' and 'heuristic' as inputs; processes neighbor nodes; outputs the shortest path if found.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior; no unusual code patterns or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard A* search with typical data structures such as heapq for the open set and dictionaries for g_score. The flow of data from input parameters through processing to output appears straightforward and typical of pathfinding algorithms. No external network calls, system modifications, or suspicious code features are evident. The function relies on a user-provided heuristic function, which is standard. The timing measurement is for performance analysis and not malicious. No anomalies or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of A* pathfinding with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs typical operations without suspicious behavior or security risks.",
