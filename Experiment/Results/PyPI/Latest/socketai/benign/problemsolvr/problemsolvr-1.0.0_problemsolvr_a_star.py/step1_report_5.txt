{
  "purpose": "Implements the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph.",
  "sources": "Imports 'heapq' and 'time' modules; reads 'graph', 'start', 'goal', and 'heuristic' parameters.",
  "sinks": "Returns a dictionary with 'path', 'steps', and 'time'; no data is sent externally or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Reads graph structure and heuristic function; outputs path and performance metrics. No external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code functions solely to perform a standard pathfinding algorithm.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and performs a typical implementation of the A* algorithm. It calculates path, steps, and timing without any suspicious operations. There are no network calls, file operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The structure is straightforward and consistent with expected behavior. No anomalies or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of the A* algorithm with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It is safe and does not contain malware or security risks.",
