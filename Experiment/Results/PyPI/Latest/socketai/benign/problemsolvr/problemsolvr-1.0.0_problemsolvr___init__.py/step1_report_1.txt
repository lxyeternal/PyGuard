{
  "purpose": "This module initializes the 'problemsolvr' package by importing the 'ProblemSolver' class from the 'problem_solver' module and defining it as part of the package's public API.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statement and the __all__ variable definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input; the code only performs static imports and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class and exposes it in the package's namespace. It does not execute any dynamic code, process external inputs, or perform actions that could be malicious. The structure is standard for Python package initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intentionally minimal.",
