  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing the ProblemSolver class for external use.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is purely an import and export definition.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard Python package initialization conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and exposes it via __all__, which is typical for Python packages. No dynamic execution, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code appears to serve as a simple module initializer with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package init file with no malicious intent, no anomalies, and no security concerns.",
