  "purpose": "Package initialization for exposing ProblemSolver class",
  "sources": "Import statement from .problem_solver module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data processing",
  "flows": "Import source to __all__ assignment; no data flows to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard code with no obfuscation or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py that imports a class and exposes it via __all__; it contains no dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The security risk score is mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is slightly cautious but unnecessary. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate; the security risk score should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
