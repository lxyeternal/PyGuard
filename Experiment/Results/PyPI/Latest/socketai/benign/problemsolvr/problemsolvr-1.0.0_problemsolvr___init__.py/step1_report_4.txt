  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named ProblemSolver from a local module, then defines __all__ to expose this class publicly. It appears to be standard package initialization code with no dynamic execution, obfuscated elements, or suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, no input/output handling, and no external network or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
