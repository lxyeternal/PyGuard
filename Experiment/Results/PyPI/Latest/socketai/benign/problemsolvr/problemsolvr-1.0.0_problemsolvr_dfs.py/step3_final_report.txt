  "purpose": "Standard depth-first search (DFS) traversal of a graph to find a path from start to goal, tracking steps and execution time.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: graph, start node, goal node; neighbors from graph.get(node, []).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network, file I/O, or environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into neighbor retrieval, then into node expansion, with no external or malicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward DFS implementation using a stack and visited set, with timing metrics. It handles neighbor data correctly, including tuples. No external or malicious operations are present. The code is clear, correct, and benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature, though the risk could be lowered to 0. given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe DFS implementation with no malicious intent or security issues. The low security risk score is justified, and no obfuscation or malware is present. The overall assessment confirms benign behavior, and the scores are appropriate.",
