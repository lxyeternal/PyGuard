{
  "purpose": "Implements a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for traversing a graph to find a path from start to goal.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'graph', 'start', and 'goal'. Uses 'time.time()' to record start and end times.",
  "sinks": "Returns a dictionary containing the path, number of steps, and elapsed time; no other data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'graph', 'start', 'goal' -> process in DFS loop -> output result with path, steps, time.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard DFS traversal with tracking of path, steps, and execution time. No input data is handled insecurely; no external network or file operations are performed. The 'time' module usage is typical for performance measurement. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified. The structure is clear, and the code aligns with common DFS implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard DFS implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It performs expected operations without any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
