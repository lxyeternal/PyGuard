{
  "purpose": "Performs depth-first search (DFS) on a graph to find a path from start to goal, tracking steps and execution time.",
  "sources": "The function reads input parameters 'graph', 'start', and 'goal'; it also reads 'neighbors' from the 'graph' data structure.",
  "sinks": "Returns a dictionary containing the 'path', 'steps', and 'time'; no sinks involve untrusted data leading to security issues.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to initialize search; 'neighbors' are retrieved from the graph; the path is built by appending neighbors; final output returns search metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. Usage of 'time' module is standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard DFS with a stack and visited set to prevent cycles. It tracks the number of steps and execution time. The 'graph' data is accessed via 'get', and neighbors are processed in reverse order. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network access, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. The logic appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard DFS implementation without malicious intent or security risks. It only processes provided graph data and returns search results, with no indication of malicious activity.",
