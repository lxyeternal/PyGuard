{
  "purpose": "Implements a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find a path from a start node to a goal node in a graph.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'graph', 'start', and 'goal'. Uses 'time.time()' to record start time.",
  "sinks": "Returns a dictionary with path, steps, and time; no untrusted data is written or sent externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are read at the start; time is measured internally; output is a dictionary of results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard DFS search with tracking of path, steps, and execution time. It uses a simple stack structure and visited set to avoid revisiting nodes. The 'time' module is used only for measuring execution duration, which is safe. No external network, file I/O, or environment variable manipulation occurs. The data flow is straightforward, with no suspicious data handling or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward implementation of DFS with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is safe and performs its intended function without evident vulnerabilities.",
