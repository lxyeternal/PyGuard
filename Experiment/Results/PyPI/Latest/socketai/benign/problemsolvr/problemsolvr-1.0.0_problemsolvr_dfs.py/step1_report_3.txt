{
  "purpose": "Perform depth-first search (DFS) on a graph to find a path from start to goal.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'graph' parameter (via graph.get), reading the 'start' and 'goal' parameters, capturing start time via time.time()",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs; no external data sinks or side-effects observed",
  "flows": "Input 'graph', 'start', 'goal' -> processing with DFS logic -> output of path, steps, and time",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No external network activity or data leaks. Usage of time module is benign and standard for performance measurement.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard DFS algorithm with typical data structures: stack for nodes to visit, set for visited nodes, and path tracking. It uses the time module to measure execution time. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, or malicious behavior is apparent. All functions and variables serve typical purposes for a graph search.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward DFS implementation for graph traversal with performance timing. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. It appears to be a benign utility function.",
