  "purpose": "Implementation of a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for traversing a graph to find a path from start to goal.",
  "sources": "The function reads input parameters 'graph', 'start', and 'goal'. It also reads the 'neighbors' of each node via 'graph.get()'.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data effects are evident; the function returns the found path, steps, and execution time. It does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> graph.get() for neighbors -> path extension in the loop -> return of result upon success or exhaustion of search.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of time.time() for timing is standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard DFS with a stack and visited set to prevent revisiting nodes. It records execution time and steps. No external data sources or sinks suggest malicious intent. No risky behaviors, such as code injection, data leakage, or hidden network activity, are present. The code is straightforward and typical for graph search algorithms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard DFS implementation with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a typical search without side effects or external data handling that could be exploited.",
