  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package called 'problemsolvr' to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the long description from 'README.md' file; reads package dependencies from 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Reads package description and dependencies; no flow from untrusted input to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() to read 'README.md' without exception handling, but this is standard in setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata, reads long description from a file, specifies dependencies, and sets classifiers. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling. The use of open() is typical for reading a description file and poses no security risk. All dependencies are standard and necessary for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This is a normal, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
