  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'problemsolvr' library, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, static code with no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, typical setup.py script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, reads a local README.md file without exception handling, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, consistent with its static and standard nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign Python package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
