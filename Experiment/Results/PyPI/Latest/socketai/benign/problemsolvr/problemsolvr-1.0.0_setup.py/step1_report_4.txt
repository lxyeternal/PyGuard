{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'problemsolvr', configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description; static metadata fields; importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' and passing static parameters directly into setup(). No external data flows or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code, runtime code execution, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to configure package distribution. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, specifies dependencies, and includes package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is simple, static, and typical of Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a normal, benign package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
