  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'problemsolvr' including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, importing 'setuptools' for package setup.",
  "targets": "No explicit untrusted data sources or user inputs. No network or external data interactions are present in this script.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data or external actions. The script only reads local files and sets up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behaviors. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks using setuptools, reading a local README file and defining dependencies. It does not contain any network activity, code execution, or data handling that could be malicious. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks in this setup.py file. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration script.",
