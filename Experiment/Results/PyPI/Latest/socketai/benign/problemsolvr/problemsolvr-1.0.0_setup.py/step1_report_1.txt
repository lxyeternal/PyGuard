{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'problemsolvr' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description; other data is hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmission points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from source to sink; the only external interaction is reading a file during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a local markdown file for description, specifies dependencies, and metadata. There are no signs of malicious intent, no network communication, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic. The code is typical for Python package distribution and lacks any harmful or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a legitimate and typical package configuration file with no indications of malicious activity or security risks.",
