  "purpose": "Implement a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find a path from a start node to a goal node in a graph.",
  "sources": "time.time() for measuring execution time, graph.get() for retrieving neighbors",
  "sinks": "None that process untrusted data directly; no external data outputs or system modifications",
  "flows": "Input graph and start/goal nodes are used to generate paths; no data flows to external systems or files",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code, and no malicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard BFS with typical data structures: deque for queue, set for visited nodes. It measures execution time but does not log or send this data externally. The graph is retrieved via get method, and neighbors are processed straightforwardly. There are no input/output vulnerabilities, no code injection points, and no suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical BFS implementation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities based on the provided code. It is safe for use.",
