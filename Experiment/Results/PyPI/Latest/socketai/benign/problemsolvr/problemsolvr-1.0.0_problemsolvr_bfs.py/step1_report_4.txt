{
  "purpose": "Implementing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for graph traversal to find a path from start to goal.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters: 'graph', 'start', and 'goal'. Uses 'time.time()' to record start and end times.",
  "sinks": "Returns a dictionary with 'path', 'steps', and 'time'; no untrusted data handling or output effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used internally; 'time.time()' readings and 'graph.get()' are benign; results are returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward BFS traversal, measuring execution time and tracking steps. It uses standard library functions and simple data structures. No evidence of data leaks, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The code's structure and behavior are typical for a BFS implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of BFS without any malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely for graph traversal and timing measurement. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
