{
  "purpose": "Implement a greedy best-first search algorithm to find a path in a graph from start to goal using a heuristic.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'graph', 'start', 'goal', and 'heuristic' functions/variables; reads 'graph' data structure.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data directly causes security issues; no data leaks, external calls, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to perform search; no untrusted data flows to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors; code performs a standard graph search.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard greedy search algorithm using a heap for prioritizing nodes based on heuristic estimates. It initializes with start node, processes nodes, and expands neighbors while tracking visited nodes and steps. No external or untrusted input handling beyond function parameters, no data leaks, no suspicious external calls, and no obfuscated code are present. The code performs a typical graph traversal without any malicious intent or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a greedy search algorithm for pathfinding, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
