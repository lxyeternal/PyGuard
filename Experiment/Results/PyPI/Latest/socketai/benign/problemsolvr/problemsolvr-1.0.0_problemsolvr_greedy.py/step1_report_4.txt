{
  "purpose": "Implements a greedy best-first search algorithm to find a path in a graph from start to goal using heuristics.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters: 'graph', 'start', 'goal', 'heuristic'. No external data sources or user inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "Returns a dictionary with path, steps, and time. No data is sent to external systems, network, or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the graph traversal logic; heuristic influences node prioritization; final results are returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard greedy best-first search: it uses a heap to prioritize nodes based on heuristic values, tracks visited nodes to avoid loops, and measures execution time. No suspicious code or malicious behavior detected. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. Usage of standard libraries (heapq, time) and the algorithm's logic are normal. The function appears safe and intended solely for graph pathfinding.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of greedy search with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs its algorithmic purpose without unusual or harmful behavior.",
