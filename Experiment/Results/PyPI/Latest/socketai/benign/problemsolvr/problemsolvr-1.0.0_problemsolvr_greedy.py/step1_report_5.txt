{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a greedy best-first search algorithm for graph traversal and pathfinding.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'graph', 'start', 'goal', and 'heuristic'. Uses 'graph.get' to access neighbors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data is written or transmitted outside the scope of the algorithm.",
  "flows": "Inputs (graph, start, goal, heuristic) → priority queue operations (heapq) → path reconstruction → output dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward greedy search using a priority queue (heapq). It reads input data for graph structure and heuristic values. The flow involves pushing and popping nodes based on heuristic scores. No external data sources, network calls, or file operations are present. The code is self-contained, well-structured, and uses standard library functions without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pathfinding implementation with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate algorithm with no signs of malware or malicious activity.",
