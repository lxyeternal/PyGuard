{
  "purpose": "Implement a greedy best-first search algorithm to find a path in a graph from start to goal using a heuristic function.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'graph' data structure, 'start', 'goal', and 'heuristic' function as input parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted external data; the function outputs a dictionary with path, steps, and timing.",
  "flows": "Reads graph and heuristic inputs; processes neighbors; constructs paths; outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. Uses standard libraries appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a greedy search algorithm with standard control flow, data structures, and external function calls. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Uses 'heapq' for priority queue and 'time' for timing, both standard modules. No dynamic execution, network calls, or suspicious data handling identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a greedy search algorithm without malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. No security concerns are evident based on the provided code.",
