{
  "purpose": "Implements a greedy best-first search algorithm for pathfinding in a graph.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'graph', 'start', 'goal', and 'heuristic' function; uses 'time' module to measure execution time.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Uses 'graph', 'start', 'goal', and 'heuristic' as input sources; processes data internally without external data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Uses standard libraries (heapq, time). No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard greedy search algorithm using a heuristic. It tracks visited nodes and measures execution time. No external data is read or written insecurely. The only external dependency is the 'heuristic' function provided as input, which is a normal pattern in search algorithms. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a greedy pathfinding algorithm without malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
