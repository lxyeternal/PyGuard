  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for any issues, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code imports local modules for algorithms and visualization, which appear standard.\n- The class `ProblemSolver` uses static methods and a class variable `results` to store outcomes.\n- No external network or file operations are evident.\n- The code performs input validation and raises exceptions appropriately.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The `results` dictionary is stored in a class variable, which could be a design concern but not malicious.\n- Visualization is optional and handled via imported functions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and potential issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  The code appears clean, well-structured, and standard for such a utility. No malicious or security-threatening operations are visible.\n\n- **Malware?**  \n  No evidence of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  The code is straightforward; no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Security risks?**  \n  The only potential concern is the persistent storage of results in a class variable, which could lead to unintended data leakage if misused, but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Score evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is consistent; no malware is detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. No obfuscation observed.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `0.1` or `0`. Given the code's nature, a small `0.1` is acceptable for the design concern about class variable persistence, but it's not a security risk per se.\n\n- **Overall risk score:**  \n  The code is benign; thus, a low risk score (e.g., 0.1) is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The reports correctly identify the code as standard, with no suspicious behavior.\n- The only potential \"issue\" is the use of a class variable for storing results, which could be considered a design flaw but not a security threat.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores for the entire code:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to persistent storage, but not malicious)\n\nThe reports' scores align well with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured problem-solving utility for graph algorithms.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behaviors are present.\n- The only minor concern is the persistent storage of results in a class variable, which is not malicious but could be reconsidered for better design.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and does not pose security risks. The scores given in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
