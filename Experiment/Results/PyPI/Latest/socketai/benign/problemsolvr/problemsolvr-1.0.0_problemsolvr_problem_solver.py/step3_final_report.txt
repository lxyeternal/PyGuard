{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for solving graph problems using various algorithms and optionally visualizes the solution path.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the solve method (graph, start, goal, method, heuristic, visualize); imported algorithm functions; visualization helper.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted external data, perform network operations, or write to files.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in algorithm functions; results are stored in a class variable; visualization uses the result data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a class variable 'results' for persistent storage, which could lead to unintended data sharing but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured utility for solving graph problems with multiple algorithms. It imports local modules, performs input validation, and stores results in a class variable. No external network, file, or environment variable operations are present. The persistent storage in a class variable is a potential design concern but not malicious. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for solving graph problems with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The minor concern about persistent result storage does not warrant a higher risk score. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
