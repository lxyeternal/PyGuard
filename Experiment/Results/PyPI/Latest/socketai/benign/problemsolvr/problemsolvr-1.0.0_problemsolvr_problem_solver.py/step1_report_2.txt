{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for solving graph problems using various algorithms and visualizing results.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.bfs, .dfs, .a_star, .greedy, .ucs, .helpers); class variables and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is sent to external systems, network, or file operations; results are stored in memory only.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (graph, start, goal, method, heuristic, visualize) flow into algorithm functions; results stored in a class variable.",
  "anomalies": "Class variable 'results' stores results persistently, which could be unintended but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present. No dynamic code execution or external data fetching observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with static methods to solve graph problems using various algorithms, storing results in a class variable for later retrieval. The algorithms are imported from local modules, and visualization is handled via an imported helper function. The methods handle input validation, error raising, and result visualization. No external network or file operations are performed. No suspicious code patterns or malicious behaviors are detected. The persistent storage of results in a class variable could be a design concern but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate problem-solving interface without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a graph problem solver with visualization, storing results internally. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The persistent result storage could be a design concern but not malicious.",
