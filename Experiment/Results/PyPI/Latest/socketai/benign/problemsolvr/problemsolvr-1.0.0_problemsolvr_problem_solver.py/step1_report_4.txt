{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class ProblemSolver that provides a static interface for solving graph problems using various algorithms, storing results, and displaying summaries.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via function parameters (graph, start, goal, method, heuristic, visualize). It also imports functions from local modules (bfs, dfs, a_star, greedy, ucs, visualize_graph).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to security issues. No data is written to files, network, or environment variables within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed to select algorithms, which produce results stored in a class variable. The results are optionally visualized and stored in a dictionary; no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behaviors. The code structure and usage appear standard for a problem-solving interface.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as an orchestrator calling imported functions based on parameters. It manages results internally without external data processing or side effects. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity is present. The import statements are relative and seem standard. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, no hardcoded credentials, and no file or network operations besides visualization which is not inherently malicious. The only notable aspect is storing results in a class variable, which does not pose security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward problem-solving interface for graph algorithms with no malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external modules for core algorithms, which are assumed to be benign. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
