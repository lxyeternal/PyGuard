{
  "purpose": "This source code provides a class interface for solving graph problems using various algorithms, storing results, and visualizing solutions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data through function parameters: 'graph', 'start', 'goal', 'method', 'heuristic', and 'visualize'.",
  "sinks": "Stores results in the class variable 'results'. No external data output or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from parameters into algorithm functions; results are stored in 'results' and optionally visualized.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple local modules for graph algorithms, defines a class with static methods to perform different searches, and optionally visualizes the results. It stores results in a class-level dictionary. The code performs standard control flow with input validation and error handling. There are no signs of malicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of local imports and standard operations suggests benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a problem solver interface with visualization and result storage, showing no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a normal, well-structured utility module for solving graph problems.",
