{
  "purpose": "Provides a static interface for solving graph problems using various algorithms and optionally visualizes the results.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.bfs, .dfs, .a_star, .greedy, .ucs, .helpers) and class variables for storing results.",
  "sinks": "Stores results in a class variable (ProblemSolver.results) which could be accessed externally; visualizes graph using visualize_graph.",
  "flows": "Method calls (bfs, dfs, a_star, greedy, ucs) process input data; results are stored in a class variable; visualization is triggered if requested.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; the code mainly handles problem-solving logic, data storage, and visualization. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several local modules for graph algorithms, defines a class with static methods for solving problems and displaying summaries. The solve() method dynamically selects algorithms based on input, handles exceptions, and optionally visualizes results. Results are stored in a class variable for later reference. No external network calls, no use of environment variables, and no suspicious file operations are present. The code appears standard for a problem-solving utility, with proper input validation and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured problem solver interface with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It primarily manages algorithm execution and result storage, with optional visualization. No malicious or security-threatening features are detected.",
