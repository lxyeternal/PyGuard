{
  "purpose": "To visualize a directed graph with an optional highlighted path using NetworkX and Matplotlib.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input 'graph' (adjacency list) and 'path' (list of nodes). It also implicitly reads from the imported libraries.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to files, send data over the network, or execute untrusted code. The only output is a plotted graph displayed via plt.show().",
  "flows": "Input data (graph and optional path) are used to construct a NetworkX graph object, which is then visualized with Matplotlib. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks beyond visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code relies entirely on external libraries for visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to visualize a graph structure and optionally highlights a specific path. It adds edges based on the adjacency list, ensuring correct node connections. It handles path highlighting and visualization cleanly, without executing any untrusted code or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The only potential concern is the use of plt.show() in environments where display output might be unintended, but this is benign in terms of security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward visualization utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations with open-source libraries, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
