  "purpose": "To visualize a graph structure and optionally highlight a solution path using NetworkX and Matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Graph data from the 'graph' argument, path data from the 'path' argument",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib's show() function, which displays the plot; no data is sent externally",
  "flows": "Graph and path data flow into visualization functions; no untrusted data flows into system commands or network",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to visualize a directed graph using NetworkX and Matplotlib. It constructs a graph from an adjacency list, optionally highlights a path, and displays the plot. The code uses fixed seed for layout reproducibility. There are no external data transmissions, no use of untrusted inputs in unsafe ways, and no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard visualization tasks without any malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on trusted libraries and processes data internally with no external or unsafe operations.",
