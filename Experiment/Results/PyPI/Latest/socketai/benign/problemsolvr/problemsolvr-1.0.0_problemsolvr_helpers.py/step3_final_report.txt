  "purpose": "Visualize a directed graph with optional highlighting of a specific path.",
  "sources": "In-memory adjacency list data structure, function parameters (graph, path, title).",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Graph data is processed internally; path highlighting is done within the function; visualization displayed locally via plt.show().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a directed graph from an adjacency list, optionally highlights a specified path, and visualizes it using matplotlib. It relies solely on trusted libraries, operates entirely in-memory, and displays the visualization locally. No external communication, file I/O, or code injection is present. The logic is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors. The code's purpose is benign, and it does not handle untrusted data in a harmful way.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign graph visualization utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
