{
  "purpose": "The code provides a visualization utility for directed graphs, optionally highlighting a solution path.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'graph' parameter and the optional 'path' parameter, both provided as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code mainly generates and displays a plot using matplotlib.",
  "flows": "Input graph data is processed to add edges to a NetworkX DiGraph object, then visualization is generated with matplotlib. The 'path' is used to highlight specific nodes and edges if provided.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code relies on standard libraries for visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to visualize a directed graph and optionally highlight a given path. It converts adjacency list input into a NetworkX directed graph, then uses matplotlib for plotting. The path, if provided, is cleaned to extract node identifiers for highlighting. No external or untrusted data processing occurs, and there are no network calls or system modifications. The libraries used are common for visualization tasks, and the code operates solely in-memory for display purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard graph visualization utility with no malicious intent or security concerns. It safely processes input data for visualization purposes without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
