  "purpose": "Implementing a Uniform Cost Search (UCS) algorithm for pathfinding in a graph.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'graph', 'start', and 'goal'. Reads data from 'graph' structure when accessing adjacency list.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsanitized data flow from 'graph' into the algorithm; no external output sinks are present that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into internal data structures, with path and cost calculations. No external sinks or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or malicious code behavior, no obfuscated code or misleading constructs. Usage of time for measuring duration is straightforward. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard UCS pathfinding using a priority queue, maintaining visited nodes with costs. It processes the graph input correctly, handling both weighted and unweighted edges. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. The usage of time is only for measuring performance and does not pose security issues. No external network or system access occurs. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of UCS without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of the UCS algorithm for pathfinding, with no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe based on the provided code.",
