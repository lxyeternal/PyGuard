  "purpose": "Implementation of the Uniform Cost Search (UCS) algorithm for finding the least-cost path in a graph.",
  "sources": "Reads input graph (graph parameter), start node, and goal node; uses time module to measure execution time.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code returns a dictionary with path, steps, and time.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (graph, start, goal) flow into the UCS function; the algorithm processes graph data, updates visited nodes, and outputs results. No external sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious operations detected. Usage of standard libraries (heapq, time).",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard UCS algorithm with typical control flow and data handling. It uses a min-heap to manage nodes to expand, records steps, and measures execution time. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is evident. It handles weighted and unweighted graphs securely. No external network calls, file operations, or hidden backdoors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of UCS without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign algorithm for pathfinding. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
