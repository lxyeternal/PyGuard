  "purpose": "Implementation of Uniform Cost Search algorithm for finding the lowest cost path in a weighted graph.",
  "sources": "Input arguments 'graph', 'start', and 'goal'; the 'graph.get()' method reads adjacency data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink functions that process untrusted data for system effects; no network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function arguments into internal structures; no external untrusted data flows to system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code does not perform any system modifications or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard Uniform Cost Search algorithm, utilizing a priority queue to manage nodes based on cumulative cost. It reads the graph data via 'graph.get()', which is typical for adjacency list representations. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or system modifications. The use of 'time' is solely for measuring execution duration, with no influence on control flow beyond timing. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are present. All data handling appears to be contained within the function's scope, with no external side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of UCS with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as an algorithmic component without external system interactions or suspicious patterns.",
