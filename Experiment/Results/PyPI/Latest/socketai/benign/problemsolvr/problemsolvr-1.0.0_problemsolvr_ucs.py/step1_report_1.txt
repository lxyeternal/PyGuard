  "purpose": "Implement the Uniform Cost Search algorithm to find the lowest-cost path in a weighted graph.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'graph', 'start', 'goal'; time.time() for measuring execution time.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted input; data is processed internally. No external data or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function arguments into the algorithm; no external or untrusted sources involved; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward, performing a standard search algorithm. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard implementation of UCS using a priority queue. It initializes with the start node, tracks visited nodes with costs, expands nodes, and pushes neighbors onto the queue with accumulated costs. The only external system call is time.time() for measuring duration, which is benign. There are no network connections, file operations, or other side effects. The function's behavior aligns with expected algorithmic logic. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a clean implementation of the UCS algorithm with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only processes provided graph data in memory and does not perform any external or harmful actions.",
