  "purpose": "Implementation of Uniform Cost Search (UCS) algorithm to find the minimum cost path in a graph.",
  "sources": "Graph data structure (dictionary), start node, goal node, time.time() for timing measurement",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data processed in-memory, no external data leaks or system modifications",
  "flows": "Graph input -> UCS processing -> Path and cost calculation -> Return results",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard data handling and timing measurement",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard UCS implementation using a priority queue, handling weighted and unweighted graphs, tracking visited nodes with minimal costs, and measuring execution time. No suspicious patterns, external system calls, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of time.time() is benign. The logic is correct, and the code is clear and readable. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of UCS with no security risks or malicious activity. The minimal use of timing functions does not introduce vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate; the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0. The minor risk score of 0.1 in one report is slightly conservative but still justified given the benign nature of timing measurement. Overall, the code is safe and free of security issues.",
