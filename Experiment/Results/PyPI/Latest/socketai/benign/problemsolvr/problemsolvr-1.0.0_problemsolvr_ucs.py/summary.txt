  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of UCS with no security risks or malicious activity. The minimal use of timing functions does not introduce vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate; the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0. The minor risk score of 0.1 in one report is slightly conservative but still justified given the benign nature of timing measurement. Overall, the code is safe and free of security issues."
