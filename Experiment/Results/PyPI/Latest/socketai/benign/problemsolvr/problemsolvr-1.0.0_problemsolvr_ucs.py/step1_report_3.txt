  "purpose": "Implementation of Uniform Cost Search algorithm for shortest path in a weighted graph.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters 'graph', 'start', and 'goal'. It also accesses 'graph' via 'graph.get(node, [])' for neighbors.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects. No external network or system commands are used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters 'graph', 'start', 'goal' through the main while loop, expanding nodes and updating 'visited' with costs, ultimately returning the path and metrics.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard logic for UCS with no unusual code constructs. It uses in-memory data structures and time measurement; no obfuscated or malicious patterns observed. Default edge cost is 1 if no weight provided, which is normal.",
  "analysis": "The function performs a typical UCS search: it maintains a priority queue for nodes to explore, tracks visited nodes with minimal costs, and constructs paths dynamically. It uses 'heapq' for efficient retrieval of lowest-cost nodes. No input data is processed insecurely; no code injections, external system calls, or secret handling are present. The code seems straightforward and aligned with its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of UCS with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It operates entirely in-memory, does not access or modify external resources, and does not contain suspicious constructs.",
