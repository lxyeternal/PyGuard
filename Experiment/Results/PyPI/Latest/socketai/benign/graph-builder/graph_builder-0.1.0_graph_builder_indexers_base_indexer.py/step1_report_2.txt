{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for an indexer with methods to add entities and finalize the process.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths since the code only declares method signatures without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only method signatures raising NotImplementedError; no unusual or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with two method signatures. There are no implementations, no data handling, and no external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. The code appears to serve as a template or interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward abstract class declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical design pattern used for class inheritance. The absence of executable logic or data handling indicates no security concerns.",
