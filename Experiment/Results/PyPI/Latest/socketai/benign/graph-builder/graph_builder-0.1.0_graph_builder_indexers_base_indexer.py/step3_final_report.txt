  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for indexers with methods to add entities and finalize the index.",
  "sources": "Method definitions `add_entity` and `finalize` raising NotImplementedError; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present; methods are placeholders raising exceptions.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; methods are intended to be overridden by subclasses.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of implementation details; purely abstract class with no suspicious or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract class with two method signatures, both raising NotImplementedError. It does not process data, communicate externally, or contain any logic. The code serves as an interface or template for subclasses. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate no security risks or malicious intent. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard abstract class serving as an interface for indexer implementations. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
