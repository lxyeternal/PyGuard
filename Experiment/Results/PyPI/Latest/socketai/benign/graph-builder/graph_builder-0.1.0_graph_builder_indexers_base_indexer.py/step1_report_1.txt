  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for indexer objects with methods to add entities and finalize processing.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; methods are abstract and contain no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Code is a straightforward abstract class definition with no suspicious or unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a class 'BaseIndexer' with two methods, 'add_entity' and 'finalize', both raising NotImplementedError, indicating they are meant to be overridden. No data handling, external communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident. The code appears to serve as a base class template for other classes.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard abstract base class with no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious features. It functions as intended for defining an interface.",
