  "purpose": "Definition of an abstract base class for indexing entities with methods to add entities and finalize the process.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading occurs in this snippet).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "No data flow present in this minimal class definition.",
  "anomalies": "The class contains only method declarations with NotImplementedError, which is normal for an abstract class; no anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple abstract class 'BaseIndexer' with two methods: add_entity and finalize. Both methods are placeholders raising NotImplementedError, indicating they are intended to be overridden in subclasses. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or external calls. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward abstract class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a base for other classes to implement indexing logic and does not perform any operations on its own.",
