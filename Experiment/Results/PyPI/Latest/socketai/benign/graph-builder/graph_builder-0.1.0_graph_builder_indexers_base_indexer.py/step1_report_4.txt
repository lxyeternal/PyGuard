  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for indexers that manage entities with methods to add entities and finalize the index.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output paths exist within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple abstract class with unimplemented methods; no unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class with two methods meant to be overridden in subclasses. It uses NotImplementedError to enforce implementation in derived classes. There are no data handling, external calls, or suspicious constructs. No indications of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward abstract base class without malicious intent or security concerns. It serves as a template for indexer implementations. No malicious or suspicious elements identified.",
