The only issue is a coding bug in the import statement for datetime handling, which should be corrected. The overall security risk is minimal, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the minor bug and standard operations."
