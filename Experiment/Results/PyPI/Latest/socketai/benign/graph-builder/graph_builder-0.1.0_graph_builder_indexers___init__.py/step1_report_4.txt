  "purpose": "Function to instantiate and return different types of indexer objects based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'indexer_type' and 'output_dir'.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of classes SQLiteIndexer or MemoryIndexer with 'output_dir'.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to determine which class to instantiate, passing 'output_dir' to the constructor.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports within conditional branches; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; no external network or data leakage evident.",
  "analysis": "The function takes an indexer type and output directory as input. It conditionally imports a class from a relative module based on 'indexer_type' and returns an instance initialized with 'output_dir'. The import statements are internal, executed only if conditions match, which is a common pattern. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, is apparent. The code appears to be straightforward, focusing on modular object creation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard factory function for object instantiation based on input parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for normal operation within a larger application.",
