{
  "purpose": "Selects and returns an indexer object based on the provided type and output directory.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'indexer_type' and 'output_dir'. Dynamic import statements within function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement creating instances of indexer classes, which may perform file operations; no explicit data sinks for untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Conditional logic -> Dynamic import -> Class instantiation -> Return indexer object.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import inside function; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The function performs a typical factory pattern for indexer objects, importing modules dynamically based on input. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. The imports are straightforward and conditional. No external network calls or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, implementing a simple factory method for indexer objects with standard import and instantiation. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
