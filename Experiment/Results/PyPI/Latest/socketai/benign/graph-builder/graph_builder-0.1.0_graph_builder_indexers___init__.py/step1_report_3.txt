  "purpose": "Function to instantiate and return an indexer object based on the specified type.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'indexer_type' and 'output_dir'.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of classes 'SQLiteIndexer' and 'MemoryIndexer' which may perform file or memory operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'indexer_type' determines which indexer class is imported and instantiated; 'output_dir' is passed to the constructor.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import statements within conditional branches are standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The function selects between two indexer implementations based on 'indexer_type', importing modules locally within the function. The imports are straightforward and tied directly to the conditional logic. The parameters are used for object construction, with no evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or hidden functionality. No external network, file access, or data leakage mechanisms are evident within this code snippet. Overall, the code appears to be a simple factory pattern for indexer objects, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard factory function for indexer objects with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain obfuscation or malware behavior; it performs straightforward module import and object creation based on input.",
