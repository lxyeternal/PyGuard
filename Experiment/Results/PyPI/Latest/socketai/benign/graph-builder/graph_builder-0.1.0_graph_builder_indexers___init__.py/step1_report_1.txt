  "purpose": "Factory function to instantiate different types of indexers based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Function parameters `indexer_type` and `output_dir`.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of classes `SQLiteIndexer` and `MemoryIndexer` which may use `output_dir` internally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into conditional branches leading to class instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The function conditionally imports modules and returns instances based on `indexer_type`. It raises an exception for unknown types, indicating input validation. The imports are local, which is a common pattern. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network access, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. The code appears straightforward, and class instantiations are controlled by explicit parameters. No external data or environment variables are accessed unsafely. Overall, the code seems legitimate and secure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple factory function for indexer objects with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It correctly validates input and performs standard imports and object creation.",
