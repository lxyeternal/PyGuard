  "purpose": "Factory function to instantiate indexer classes based on the provided indexer type, supporting modular plugin-like behavior.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'indexer_type' used to determine which module to import; 'output_dir' passed to constructors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'indexer_type' controls which local module is imported and instantiated; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward conditional imports and object creation; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, controlled factory pattern with local imports based on explicit string checks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The dynamic import pattern is standard for plugin systems, assuming input validation occurs externally. The code raises an exception for unknown types, which is good practice. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and controlled behavior. Given the absence of suspicious activity and the controlled import pattern, the overall security posture is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, secure factory function with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minimal risk score is appropriate, and the malware score correctly indicates no malicious activity. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
