  "purpose": "Defines a MemoryIndexer class to store entity data in memory and save it as a JSON file.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: output_dir, entity_id, and properties from method calls.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a JSON file in the specified output directory.",
  "flows": "add_entity method stores data in self.map; finalize method writes self.map to a file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple in-memory indexer that collects entity information and saves it to a JSON file. No user input is directly read from external sources beyond method parameters, and file writing is limited to the specified output directory. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code structure and logic are straightforward and align with normal data handling routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard component for indexing entities and saving data locally without any malicious intent or security risks.",
