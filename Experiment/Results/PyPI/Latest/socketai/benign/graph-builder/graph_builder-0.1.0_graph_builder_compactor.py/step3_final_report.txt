  "purpose": "Processes entity and relation logs to merge updates, shard entity data, and build adjacency lists for graph analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'entity_updates.jsonl' and 'relation_updates.jsonl' log files.",
  "sinks": "Writes merged entity data to shard files and adjacency lists to a JSONL file.",
  "flows": "Reads log lines -> parses JSON -> merges/aggregates data -> writes to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O and JSON processing to merge entity updates and build adjacency lists. It uses straightforward data structures like defaultdict and standard library functions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The unvalidated file inputs pose minimal risk in context but are typical for log processing scripts. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data processing utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score of approximately 0.1 is appropriate, considering potential unvalidated inputs but no active vulnerabilities.",
