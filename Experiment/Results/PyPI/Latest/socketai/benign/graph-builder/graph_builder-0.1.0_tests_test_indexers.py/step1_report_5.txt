  "purpose": "Unit tests for indexer modules (MemoryIndexer and SQLiteIndexer) in the graph_builder package, ensuring correct behavior.",
  "sources": "Tests create temporary directories and files, and import modules and classes.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (creating and writing JSON files, SQLite database files), database queries.",
  "flows": "Tests instantiate indexers, add entities, finalize, and verify file/database contents.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is standard for unit testing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard unit testing of indexer classes. It creates temporary directories for file operations, adds entities, and verifies persistence by reading files and database entries. No untrusted input handling or network communication is present. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns. Usage of standard libraries (json, os, tempfile) and well-known testing practices indicate normal, safe code behavior. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical test suite for indexer components, with no malicious or suspicious behaviors identified. It performs standard file and database operations securely within a controlled testing environment.",
