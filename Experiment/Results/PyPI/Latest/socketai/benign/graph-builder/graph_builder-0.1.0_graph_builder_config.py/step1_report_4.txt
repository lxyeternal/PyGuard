  "purpose": "Define a configuration data structure for a graph builder with output directory, shard size, and indexer type settings.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard Python features without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass named GraphBuilderConfig with three attributes: output_dir (string), shard_size (integer with default 1000), and indexer_type (string with default 'sqlite'). There are no external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The default values are typical for configuration settings. The use of dataclasses and default parameters is standard practice and poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration class with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It is safe and typical for setting up application parameters.",
