  "purpose": "Define configuration parameters for graph building, including output directory, shard size, and indexer type.",
  "sources": "No external input; static code defining class attributes with default values.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, external data, or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward dataclass with default parameters, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python dataclass used for configuration, with no external input, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file operations. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. There are no anomalies or suspicious features. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration class with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
