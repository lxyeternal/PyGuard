  "purpose": "Defines a configuration data structure for a graph builder, specifying output directory, shard size, and indexer type.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard Python dataclass syntax with default values. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a dataclass 'GraphBuilderConfig' with three fields: 'output_dir', 'shard_size', and 'indexer_type'. Default values are provided for 'shard_size' and 'indexer_type'. The code is straightforward and follows standard Python conventions without any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external dependencies that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration class with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for configuration purposes.",
