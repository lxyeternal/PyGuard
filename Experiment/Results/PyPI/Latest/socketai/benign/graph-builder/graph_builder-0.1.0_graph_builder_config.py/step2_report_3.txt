  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward data class defining configuration parameters.\n   - The original code snippet does not contain any malicious code, external input handling, or dynamic execution.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of external inputs, data leaks, or malicious activity.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0 for malware and security risk, there's no need to adjust scores upward.\n   - The code does not pose any security threat or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis:**\n   - All reports assign malware: 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies or dynamic behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, uses standard Python features.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\nGiven the simplicity and safety of this code snippet, I agree with the provided assessments. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analyses provided.",
