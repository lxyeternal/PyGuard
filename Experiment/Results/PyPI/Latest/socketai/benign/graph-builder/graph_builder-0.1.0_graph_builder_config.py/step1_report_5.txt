  "purpose": "Defines a data class for configuration settings of a graph builder, specifying output directory, shard size, and indexer type.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that could lead to data leaks or untrusted data effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only declares a data class with default values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the dataclass decorator, defines a configuration class with straightforward attributes, and assigns default values for optional parameters. No user input, network activity, or sensitive operations are involved. The code appears to be a simple configuration data container with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a configuration holder without any malicious intent or security risks.",
