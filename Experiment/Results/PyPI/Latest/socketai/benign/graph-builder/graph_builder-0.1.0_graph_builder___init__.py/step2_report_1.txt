  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version module for a Python package.\n   - It defines version strings and tuples with static values.\n   - It uses a `TYPE_CHECKING` conditional for type hints, which is standard practice.\n   - There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, network operations, or obfuscation.\n   - No code injection, data leaks, or malicious logic are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Anomalies or Suspicious Patterns:**\n   - The only slightly unusual aspect is the `TYPE_CHECKING` conditional, which is common in type hinting.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n   - The code is boilerplate, auto-generated, and serves a benign purpose.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified by the benign, static nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely for version management, with no external or untrusted data involved.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; they correctly note the code's benign nature.\n\n5. **Consistency & Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No need for score adjustments.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risk.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThis is a standard, auto-generated version management snippet with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security concerns.",
