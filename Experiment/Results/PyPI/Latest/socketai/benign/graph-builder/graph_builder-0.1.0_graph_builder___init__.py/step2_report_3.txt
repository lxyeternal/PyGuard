  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is a standard auto-generated version management snippet, typical for Python projects using setuptools-scm.\n- It contains static version strings and tuples, with conditional type hints.\n- There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, nor does it contain any suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n**Presence of Issues:**\n- The code matches the description: static version variables, conditional type hints, no dynamic or malicious logic.\n- No anomalies, no suspicious data flows, no external dependencies involved.\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores reflecting that.\n\n**Errors or Flaws in Reports:**\n- No logical errors or mistakes are evident in any report.\n- All reports consistently describe the code as straightforward and safe.\n- The type checking conditional (`if TYPE_CHECKING`) is standard practice and not suspicious.\n\n**Score Justifications:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty given the benign nature.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are also 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores:**\n- No discrepancies are apparent; all scores seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports is correct. The code is purely static and auto-generated.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as there is no obfuscation or code hiding.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, since there's no vulnerability, external input, or malicious intent.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- Since the code is auto-generated and contains only version info, there's no need to adjust scores.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is entirely benign, standard boilerplate for version management, with no security risks or malicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated content. The assigned scores reflect this well.\n\n**No further action needed.**",
