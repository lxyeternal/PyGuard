{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm, including version strings and tuples.",
  "sources": "The version strings '__version__', 'version', and the version tuple '__version_tuple__', 'version_tuple'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data; code only sets version variables.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version strings and tuples to module-level variables; no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual constructs. The only notable aspect is the comment indicating it is auto-generated and should not be changed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables using hardcoded version data, which is typical for package versioning. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no code injection points, no suspicious network or file operations, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The use of 'TYPE_CHECKING' for type hints is standard practice. Overall, the code serves a benign purpose of version declaration with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, auto-generated version declaration snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data, nor does it contain any malicious or obfuscated elements.",
