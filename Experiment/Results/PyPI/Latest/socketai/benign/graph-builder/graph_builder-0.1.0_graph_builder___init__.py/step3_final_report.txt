{
  "purpose": "This code provides static version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, serving as metadata without dynamic behavior.",
  "sources": "The version string assignments (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple) are hardcoded; no external inputs or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code contains only static variable assignments.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not process external or untrusted data, only assigns static values.",
  "anomalies": "The only minor anomaly is the use of a TYPE_CHECKING conditional, which is standard for type hints but could be considered slightly unusual in minimal code; however, it is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version module with static version strings and tuples, using standard type hinting practices. It contains no dynamic code, external inputs, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The use of TYPE_CHECKING is standard and does not introduce security concerns. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is purely for version metadata, with no potential for malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and serves a standard purpose in version management. All signals indicate no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified.",
