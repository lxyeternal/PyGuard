  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external data output.",
  "flows": "N/A; variable assignments are straightforward and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines version variables for package metadata. It imports typing only during type checking, which is standard. The version strings and tuples are statically assigned with no dynamic or external input involved. There are no functions, network operations, or data leaks. The code appears to be auto-generated with a clear purpose and no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated version declaration snippet with no malicious intent or security risks.",
