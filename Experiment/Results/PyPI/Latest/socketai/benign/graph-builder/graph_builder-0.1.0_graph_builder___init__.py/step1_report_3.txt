{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm, primarily for package metadata management.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and tuples assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets static version variables.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; the code is straightforward and only includes version declarations. The only unusual aspect is the TYPE_CHECKING conditional, which is standard for type hints but does not involve any malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated version module by setuptools-scm. It includes static version strings and tuples with no dynamic or untrusted input. The TYPE_CHECKING block is used for type hinting and does not execute at runtime. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious activity is present. The purpose is purely to provide version metadata for the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple version information holder with no malicious intent. It does not pose security risks and is a typical pattern for package versioning metadata.",
