  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, including version strings and tuples, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "The version strings (__version__, version) and version tuple (__version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks involving untrusted data; the code only assigns static version information.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version strings to version variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward version assignment with no external data or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables (__version__, version) and a version tuple (__version_tuple__, version_tuple) to static values. It includes a TYPE_CHECKING conditional for type hints, which does not execute at runtime. There are no external inputs, no data manipulation, no environment variable usage, and no code injection points. The structure is simple and standard for version management. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe version definition script generated by setuptools-scm. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks.",
