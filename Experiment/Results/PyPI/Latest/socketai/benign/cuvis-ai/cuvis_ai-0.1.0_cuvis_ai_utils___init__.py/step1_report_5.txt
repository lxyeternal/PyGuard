{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to visualization and label generation, likely for a machine learning or computer vision project.",
  "sources": "Imports functions or classes from local modules: 'visualize' and 'numpy' within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks is demonstrated; the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple import statements for local modules, with no processing, input reading, or data handling shown. Since these are local imports, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security issues. The modules imported may perform complex functions, but from this snippet alone, there is no malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of local module imports with no suspicious or malicious behavior apparent. It appears to be part of a larger, benign project.",
