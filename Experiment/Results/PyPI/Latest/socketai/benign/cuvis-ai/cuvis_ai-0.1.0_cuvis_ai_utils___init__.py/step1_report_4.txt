{
  "purpose": "Importing visualization functions and a label generation function from local modules, likely for data processing or visualization tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: 'visualize' and 'numpy' within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sources or sinks are evident in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible due to the limited code; imports do not establish source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports is standard in package development; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only two import statements from local modules, which are common and do not indicate malicious intent. No external data sources, network activity, or risky behaviors are present. The functions imported appear to be for visualization and label generation, which are typical in data processing pipelines. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase used for visualization and label generation.",
