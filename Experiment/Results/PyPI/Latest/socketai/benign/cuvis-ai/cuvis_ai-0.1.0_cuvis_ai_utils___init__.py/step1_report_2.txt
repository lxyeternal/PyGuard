{
  "purpose": "The code imports visualization functions and a label generation function, likely for image processing or machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load modules or functions from relative files.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly shown; no data flow analysis possible from import statements alone.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing from local modules. These modules are named 'visualize' and 'numpy', with one function 'gen_coco_labels' suggested by the import. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity is apparent. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving as setup for other parts of a program.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is a simple import statement without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard part of a larger project, with no security concerns based solely on this snippet.",
