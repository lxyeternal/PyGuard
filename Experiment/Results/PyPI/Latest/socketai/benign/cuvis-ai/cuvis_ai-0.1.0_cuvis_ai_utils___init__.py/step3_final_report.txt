  "purpose": "Import statements for visualization and label generation modules within a larger package.",
  "sources": "Local modules '.visualize' and '.numpy' imported via relative import statements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; only module imports are present.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules into the namespace; no data flow or execution beyond import occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from local modules, which is typical in Python projects. No data processing, network activity, or code execution is present. The import of modules like 'visualize' and 'gen_coco_labels' does not indicate malicious intent by itself. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1, confidence=0.9-1) are consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet. The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 in one report may be an overly cautious estimate, but it remains acceptable given the minimal context. Overall, the code is benign, and the risk assessments are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of local import statements typical in Python packages. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned are reasonable, with a minor suggestion to set the securityRisk score to 0 across all reports for consistency.",
