{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules or functions from local packages for visualization and label generation, likely for data processing or model training.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .visualize and .numpy",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions observed",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are only import statements with no data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, which are common in Python projects. There are no hardcoded secrets, no data handling, and no network or system operations. The imported functions or modules are not detailed here, but their mere presence does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard import statements for a project.",
