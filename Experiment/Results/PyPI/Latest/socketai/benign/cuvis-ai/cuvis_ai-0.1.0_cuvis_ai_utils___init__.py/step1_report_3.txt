{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to visualization and numpy-based label generation, likely for data processing or visualization tasks in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .visualize and .numpy",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in the provided code",
  "flows": "No data flow observed within this snippet; imports do not execute data flows themselves",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed; the code is minimal and standard for module imports",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or system modifications. The imported functions or modules may contain malicious code, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard import statements for a Python project, with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues based solely on this snippet.",
