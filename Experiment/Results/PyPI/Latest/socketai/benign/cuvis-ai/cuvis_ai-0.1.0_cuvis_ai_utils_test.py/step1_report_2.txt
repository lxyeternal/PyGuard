  "purpose": "Generate random dummy data using NumPy's random number generator.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'shape' which determines the shape of the generated array.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the generated array; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'shape' flows into np.random.rand function to produce random data, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward use of NumPy for data generation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that creates a NumPy array filled with random floats, based on the provided shape. It uses np.random.rand which is a standard NumPy function for generating random data. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code does not perform any network communication, data leakage, or system modifications. The use of np.random.rand is typical for dummy data generation in testing or modeling scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign utility function for generating random data with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
