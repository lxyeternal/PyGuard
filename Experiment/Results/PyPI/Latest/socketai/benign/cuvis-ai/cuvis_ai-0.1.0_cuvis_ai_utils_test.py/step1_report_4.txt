{
  "purpose": "Generate random dummy data using NumPy for testing or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'shape' for the data array dimensions.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the generated data, which could be used downstream.",
  "flows": "Input 'shape' is passed to np.random.rand to generate data, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard NumPy functions without hidden or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports NumPy and defines a function to generate random data with specified shape using np.random.rand. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated patterns. The use of standard library functions indicates typical data generation behavior. The function is straightforward and does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or insecure actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for generating random data using NumPy. It appears legitimate with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
