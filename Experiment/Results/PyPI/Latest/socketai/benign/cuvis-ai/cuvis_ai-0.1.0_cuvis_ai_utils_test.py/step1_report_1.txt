{
  "purpose": "Generate random dummy data using NumPy for testing or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the 'shape' parameter passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The code writes or outputs data through the return statement of the function; no untrusted data output is evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'shape' flows into np.random.rand to generate data, which is then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to generate a NumPy array of random values with the specified shape. It uses standard library functions without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No input validation or environment checks are present, but that is typical for this purpose. No signs of malicious code, data leakage, or security issues are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility function for generating random data. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
