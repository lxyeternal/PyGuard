  "purpose": "Generate dummy numerical data using numpy's random functionality.",
  "sources": "np.random.rand function, which generates random data based on the input shape.",
  "sinks": "Data returned by get_np_dummy_data, used for testing or simulations, with no external data input.",
  "flows": "Input shape parameter flows into np.random.rand to produce random data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and uses standard numpy functions for data generation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and defines a function that creates an array of random numbers with the specified shape. It uses numpy's random.rand method, which is standard for generating dummy data for testing or simulation purposes. There are no hardcoded credentials, external data sources, or suspicious behaviors. The function's purpose appears benign and typical for data-related tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and appears safe. It generates random data for testing purposes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
