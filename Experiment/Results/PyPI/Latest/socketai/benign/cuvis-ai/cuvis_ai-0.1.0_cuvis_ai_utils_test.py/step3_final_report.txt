  "purpose": "Generate a NumPy array of random floats with a specified shape for dummy data purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'shape' used in np.random.rand(*shape).",
  "sinks": "Returns the generated NumPy array; no external data or untrusted input is processed beyond the shape parameter.",
  "flows": "Shape parameter flows into np.random.rand, which produces the random data array, then returns it.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, uses standard NumPy functions, no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple utility function that creates a NumPy array of random floats with the given shape. It uses standard, well-known NumPy functions without any suspicious or malicious operations. No input validation or environment checks are present, but that is typical for such utility functions. All reviews agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of anomalies. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident, and the code does not perform any network, file, or system operations that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for generating dummy data, with no malicious behavior or security risks. All assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
