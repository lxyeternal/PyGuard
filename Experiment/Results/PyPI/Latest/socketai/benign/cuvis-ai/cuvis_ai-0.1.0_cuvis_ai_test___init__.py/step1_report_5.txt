  "sources": "The code does not contain any visible input sources, such as file reads, network requests, environment variables, or user input handling.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sink points such as network transmissions, file modifications, or system commands that could indicate data exfiltration or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from any source to sink is present in the code, indicating a lack of executable logic or data processing pathways.",
  "anomalies": "The code is empty or missing content; no anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious patterns are detectable. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is entirely absent or incomplete, with no executable statements, data handling, or logic. This suggests either a placeholder or an error in code submission. No malicious or security-threatening behavior can be inferred from an empty or missing code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a non-functional or placeholder snippet, posing no threat. Further context or actual code content is needed for a comprehensive security assessment.",
