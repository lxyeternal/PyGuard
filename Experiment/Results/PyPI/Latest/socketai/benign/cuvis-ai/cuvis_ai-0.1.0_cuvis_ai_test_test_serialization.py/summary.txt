  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for ML components, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate. The slight risk score of 0.2 in report 5 appears unjustified and should be lowered to 0 for consistency."
