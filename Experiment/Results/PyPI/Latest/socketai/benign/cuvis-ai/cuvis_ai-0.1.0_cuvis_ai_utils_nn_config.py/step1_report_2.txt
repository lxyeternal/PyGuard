{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base class 'Optimizer' and two concrete optimizer classes 'Adam' and 'SGD' with methods to retrieve their configurations for different machine learning libraries.",
  "sources": "Imports 'abc', 'abstractmethod', 'dataclass', and 'torch.optim' (conditionally).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only internal property access and optional import of torch.optim.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Import of 'torch.optim' is conditional and standard for deep learning frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'Optimizer' with abstract properties, and two dataclass implementations 'Adam' and 'SGD' that provide configurations for optimizer algorithms. Both classes include methods to generate argument dictionaries for use with scikit-learn and PyTorch, with safe import handling. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor is any untrusted data processed or transmitted. The only external dependency is 'torch.optim', imported only when needed, with appropriate exception handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of optimizer configuration classes for machine learning workflows. There are no indicators of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
