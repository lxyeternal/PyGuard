  "conclusion": "The code is benign in its structure but carries inherent security risks due to pickle deserialization of untrusted data. No malicious code or obfuscation is detected. The primary concern is the potential execution of arbitrary code during untrusted pickle loads. The overall security risk score should reflect this, with a moderate to high value (around 0.5), acknowledging the known dangers of pickle. Malware score remains 0, and obfuscation is absent."
