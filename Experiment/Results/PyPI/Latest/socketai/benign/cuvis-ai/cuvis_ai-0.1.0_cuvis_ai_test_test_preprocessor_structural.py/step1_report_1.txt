  "purpose": "Unit testing for PCA and NMF preprocessing classes within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from other modules (preprocessor, utils.test), function get_np_dummy_data, unittest framework.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output points that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Data generated by get_np_dummy_data flows into fit and check_input_dim methods of PCA and NMF classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code is standard unit test structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines test classes for PCA and NMF classes, using dummy data generation and assertions. No suspicious or malicious code is present. Imports are from local modules; dummy data functions are used for testing purposes. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. No external network calls, environment variable misuse, or harmful actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of unit tests for preprocessing classes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
