{
  "purpose": "The code defines unit tests for PCA and NMF preprocessing classes, verifying initialization, input/output dimensions, and data transformation correctness.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (`..preprocessor`, `..utils.test`) and the function `get_np_dummy_data` which generates dummy data for testing.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data; the code primarily handles internal test data and assertions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from data generation (`get_np_dummy_data`) to class method calls (`fit`, `check_input_dim`, `forward`) with internal assertions, with no external data transmission or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code is standard unit testing code, with no hidden or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing modules and data generators, then defines test classes that initialize PCA and NMF objects, run fit and check methods, and verify output shapes. The code structure adheres to normal testing practices, with no suspicious logic, dynamic code execution, or data leaks. The imports are from local modules and appear to serve legitimate testing purposes. There are no indications of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration activities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard unit testing suite for PCA and NMF preprocessing classes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates solely within testing contexts and handles dummy data without external input or sensitive information.",
