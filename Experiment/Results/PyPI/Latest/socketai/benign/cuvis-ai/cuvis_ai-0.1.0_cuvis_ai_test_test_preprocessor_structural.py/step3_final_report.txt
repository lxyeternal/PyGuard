  "purpose": "Unit tests for PCA and NMF preprocessing classes using dummy data to verify initialization, input/output dimensions, and data transformation.",
  "sources": "get_np_dummy_data function generating dummy NumPy arrays for testing; class methods of PCA and NMF classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external network calls, or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Dummy data generated by get_np_dummy_data flows into PCA/NMF fit and forward methods; no external or malicious data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit testing suite for PCA and NMF classes, utilizing dummy data for validation. It contains no external dependencies, network calls, or data leaks. The tests focus on class initialization, input/output shape checks, and data transformation correctness. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code structure is standard, and the dummy data functions are typical for testing purposes. Given the absence of suspicious activity or vulnerabilities, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured unit test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe testing environment. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
