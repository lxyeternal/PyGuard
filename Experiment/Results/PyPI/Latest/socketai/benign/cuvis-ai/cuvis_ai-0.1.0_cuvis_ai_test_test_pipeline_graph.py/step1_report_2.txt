{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or comments, the purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from functions like 'input()', environment variables, or external files (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls if present, but none are explicitly evident in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Without explicit data flow, it is difficult to map source-to-sink paths; no suspicious data flows identified from the code shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution observed. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard Python constructs with no signs of malicious behavior. No external network access, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms are evident. Usage of libraries and functions seems consistent with typical application logic. Absence of hidden or obfuscated code reduces suspicion. Lack of comments or purpose makes definitive analysis difficult, but no anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign and typical of standard Python scripts.",
