{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing image data and feature data using matplotlib and PCA.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through function parameters: 'preds' for image visualization, 'data' and 'labels' for feature visualization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; the code primarily visualizes data provided as function arguments.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters to visualization functions without any data manipulation that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard PCA-based visualization.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries for numerical operations and plotting, including numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn. It defines two visualization functions: one for image data and one for feature data. Both functions reshape and process the input data but do not perform any data manipulation or network operations. No code injection, credential handling, or suspicious behavior is present. No obfuscation or hidden code detected. The code appears to be straightforward data visualization routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply visualizes provided data using PCA and matplotlib without any suspicious activities.",
