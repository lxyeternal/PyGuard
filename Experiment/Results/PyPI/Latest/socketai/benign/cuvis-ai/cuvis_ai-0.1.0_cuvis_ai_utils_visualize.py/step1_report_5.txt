{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for image data and feature data using PCA for dimensionality reduction.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters 'preds' and 'data', as well as optional 'labels'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs visualizations using matplotlib, which does not pose security risks. No data is written to external servers or files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into PCA transformation and visualization functions, with no external data transfer or manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward functions. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard visualization and data processing libraries, defines functions for image display and PCA-based feature visualization. It performs PCA for dimensionality reduction, then plots results. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data leakage observed. The functions are typical for data visualization tasks and do not perform any risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving standard visualization purposes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
