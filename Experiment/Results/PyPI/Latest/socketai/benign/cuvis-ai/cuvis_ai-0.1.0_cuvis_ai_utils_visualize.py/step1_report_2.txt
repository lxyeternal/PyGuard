{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for image data and feature data using PCA and matplotlib.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from parameters 'preds', 'data', and 'labels' passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data into potentially dangerous actions such as network access, file modification, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data (preds, data, labels) is read and processed for visualization; there are no flows leading to unsafe or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code relies solely on standard data processing and visualization libraries without unusual operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines visualization functions using standard libraries (numpy, matplotlib, sklearn). It performs PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualizes data without any suspicious activity. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is evident. The code is straightforward and typical for data visualization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely focused on data visualization. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are identified.",
