{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for image data and feature data, applying PCA for dimensionality reduction and plotting results.",
  "sources": "Input numpy arrays passed as function parameters; no external data sources or input methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file I/O, or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through reshaping and PCA transformation to visualization via matplotlib.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, using standard libraries without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data visualization tasks with numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn. It reshapes data, applies PCA, and plots results. No network activity, file operations, or dynamic code execution are involved. The code is clear, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate benign behavior, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are justified and consistent with the code's functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard visualization utility with no malicious or security concerns. The existing scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
