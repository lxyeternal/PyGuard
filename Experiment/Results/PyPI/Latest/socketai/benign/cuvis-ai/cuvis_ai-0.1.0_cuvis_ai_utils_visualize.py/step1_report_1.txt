{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for image data and features, specifically using PCA for dimensionality reduction and plotting with matplotlib.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through function parameters: 'preds' in 'visualize_image' and 'data' and 'labels' in 'visualize_features'.",
  "sinks": "The code visualizes data via matplotlib; no direct untrusted data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from function parameters, processed (reshaped, PCA transformation), then visualized via matplotlib; no data flows outside the process that could lead to leaks or malicious effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. The code employs standard data visualization techniques and PCA for dimensionality reduction.",
  "analysis": "The script imports common data science libraries (numpy, matplotlib, sklearn). It defines two visualization functions that process and plot image data and features. The functions perform reshaping, PCA dimensionality reduction, and plotting with no network or file I/O. No code execution or code injection mechanisms are present. The code appears standard and well-structured for visualization purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for visualization of image data and features, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It employs standard libraries and techniques without any suspicious elements.",
