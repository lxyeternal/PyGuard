{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for image data and features, specifically plotting images and performing PCA for dimensionality reduction visualization.",
  "sources": "Data input comes from the 'preds' and 'data' numpy arrays passed to functions; no external data sources or user inputs are used within the code.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs visualizations via matplotlib's plt.show(); no data leaks or sensitive information outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Input numpy arrays are processed through PCA transformations and then visualized; no data flow to external systems or networks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The code solely performs visualization and PCA.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries and defines two visualization functions. It reshapes image data, applies PCA for dimensionality reduction, and plots the results. No suspicious or malicious code segments, network activities, or hidden behaviors are detected. All operations are typical for data visualization in machine learning workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for visualization purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It processes data for visual output and uses common scientific libraries. No security risks are identified.",
