  "purpose": "Lazy-loading submodules within the 'cuvis_ai' package using dynamic import via __getattr__.",
  "sources": "Access to attributes corresponding to submodule names in _submodules list.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import via importlib.import_module; no untrusted data handling or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Attribute access to __getattr__, which imports 'cuvis_ai.{name}' if name in _submodules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard pattern for lazy-loading submodules, with a predefined list restricting dynamic imports. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The pattern is safe provided the list remains controlled. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this pattern, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1-0.2). The confidence levels are high, and no false positives are evident. The code does not perform any malicious actions, contain obfuscation, or handle untrusted inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe implementation for dynamic module loading with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
