  "purpose": "Dynamic module loader for the 'cuvis_ai' package, enabling on-demand import of submodules.",
  "sources": "User or external code calling __getattr__ to access submodules; importlib.import_module used for importing modules dynamically.",
  "targets": "Potential access to submodules via dynamic import; no direct data leaks or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "External code invokes __getattr__, which conditionally imports submodules based on the name, facilitating access to 'cuvis_ai' submodules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ for dynamic module loading is normal, but can potentially be exploited if submodule names are influenced by untrusted input; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of submodules for a package and uses __getattr__ to import them dynamically when accessed. The __dir__ method makes these submodules discoverable via introspection. The dynamic import via importlib is standard for such patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only concern could be if the submodule names are influenced externally, which could lead to importing unintended modules, but this is not evident here. Overall, this is a standard, safe implementation for lazy-loading submodules.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a dynamic module loader with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical pattern for large packages to implement lazy importing of submodules. No suspicious activity or malware indications are present.",
