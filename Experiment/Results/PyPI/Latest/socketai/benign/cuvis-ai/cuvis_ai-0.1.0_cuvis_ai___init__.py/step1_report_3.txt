  "purpose": "Dynamically import submodules of the 'cuvis_ai' package upon attribute access",
  "sources": "Attribute access to unknown attributes triggering importlib.import_module",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external outputs are directly involved",
  "flows": "Attribute access -> __getattr__ -> importlib.import_module",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ to dynamically import modules is common but can be misused if the submodule list is manipulated or if imported modules have malicious code; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code is present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of submodules and uses __getattr__ to dynamically import these modules from the 'cuvis_ai' namespace when accessed. The __dir__ function supports introspection by listing submodules. The import process is controlled and limited to predefined submodules, reducing risk of arbitrary code execution. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The design is standard for plugin-like modules, and there are no indications of malicious intent or security issues within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs controlled dynamic importing of submodules for the 'cuvis_ai' package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this implementation. It appears to be a standard pattern for package namespace management with no malicious intent.",
