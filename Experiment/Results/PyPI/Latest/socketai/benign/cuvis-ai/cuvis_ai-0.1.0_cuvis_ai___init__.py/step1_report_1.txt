  "purpose": "Dynamic module import management for the 'cuvis_ai' package, enabling lazy loading of submodules.",
  "sources": "Submodule names listed in the _submodules list, used in __getattr__ to load modules dynamically.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or output generation from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "When an attribute matching a submodule name is accessed, importlib.import_module loads 'cuvis_ai.{name}', establishing a direct flow from attribute access to dynamic import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ for dynamic import is typical for plugin-like architectures, not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. No evidence of malicious behavior or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of submodule names for the package. __dir__ provides introspection, listing available submodules. __getattr__ intercepts attribute access; if the attribute matches a submodule, it dynamically imports it from 'cuvis_ai'. Otherwise, it tries to return a global variable or raises an AttributeError. This pattern facilitates lazy loading of modules, which can improve startup performance and modular design. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or malicious code execution. The code is straightforward and typical for modular Python packages with dynamic imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for managing lazy module imports in a Python package. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It simply enables dynamic loading of submodules based on attribute access, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
