  "purpose": "Dynamically loads submodules of the 'cuvis_ai' package when accessed.",
  "sources": "Access to attribute names via __getattr__, referencing the _submodules list.",
  "sinks": "Importing modules dynamically with importlib.import_module based on attribute names.",
  "flows": "Attribute access (__getattr__) triggers importlib.import_module to load submodules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ for dynamic import is a common pattern, no unusual code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of submodules and uses __getattr__ to intercept attribute access. When an attribute matches a submodule name, it dynamically imports that submodule from 'cuvis_ai' package. The __dir__ function lists available submodules. The fallback in __getattr__ attempts to access globals(), and if not found, raises an AttributeError. This pattern is typical for lazy loading modules and does not perform any malicious actions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code is evident. No data leakage, insecure use, or code injection vulnerabilities are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of dynamic module loading via __getattr__ for a package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code snippet.",
