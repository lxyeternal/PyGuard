  "purpose": "A wrapper class for Gymnasium environments providing methods for environment interaction, including reset, step, render, and sampling actions.",
  "sources": "gym.make() for environment creation, environment's action_space.sample() for sampling actions, environment's reset() and step() methods for data input.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input actions are passed to env.step(); environment state is retrieved via env.reset() and env.step(); rendering via env.render().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a Gymnasium environment wrapper, utilizing typical API calls without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or contain obfuscated code. The environment is created with a seed, and action space is rescaled if continuous, which is common practice. No external data leaks or malicious logic are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard wrapper for Gymnasium environments with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
