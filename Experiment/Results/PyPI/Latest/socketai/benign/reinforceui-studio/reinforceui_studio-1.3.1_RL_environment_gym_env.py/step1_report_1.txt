{
  "purpose": "Wrapper class for interacting with Gymnasium environments, providing methods for environment management, action sampling, and rendering.",
  "sources": "Imports of gymnasium, numpy, and typing modules; gym.make; environment attribute access; seed setting; action sampling and environment reset/step methods.",
  "sinks": "Environment methods (reset, step, render) that handle environment state and rendering; no external data sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Code initializes environment, resets with seed, samples actions, takes steps, renders frames, and closes environment. Data flows from environment attributes and methods, with no untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code appears standard for environment wrappers, with no suspicious behavior or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Gymnasium environment wrapper. It initializes environments with specified parameters, manages action space rescaling if needed, and provides methods for environment interaction. All methods invoke standard Gymnasium API functions without data leaks, external connections, or suspicious manipulations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an environment wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to typical patterns for managing Gymnasium environments and does not contain malicious behaviors or security vulnerabilities.",
