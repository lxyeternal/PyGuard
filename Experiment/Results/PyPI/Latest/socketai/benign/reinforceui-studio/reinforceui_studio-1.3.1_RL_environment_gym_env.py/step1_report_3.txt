{
  "purpose": "The code provides a wrapper class for interacting with Gymnasium environments, including initialization, resetting, stepping, rendering, and sampling actions.",
  "sources": "Reads environment name, seed, render mode from arguments; calls gym.make(), environment reset, step, render, and close methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially uncontrolled environment rendering and sampling functions; no external data flows or untrusted outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Environment creation -> reset (seed) -> sample actions -> step -> render -> close; no data flows from external sources to sinks that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. All functions follow standard Gymnasium API usage.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly initializes and interacts with Gymnasium environments, using standard APIs for environment management. No external inputs other than parameters are processed in a way that could be malicious. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. The implementation adheres to normal usage patterns of Gymnasium and numpy libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward wrapper for Gymnasium environments with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only performs environment management functions using standard APIs.",
