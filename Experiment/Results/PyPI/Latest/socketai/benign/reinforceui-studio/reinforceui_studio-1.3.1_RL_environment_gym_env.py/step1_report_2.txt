{
  "purpose": "The code provides a wrapper class for interacting with Gymnasium environments, including initialization, sampling actions, resetting, stepping through the environment, rendering, and closing.",
  "sources": "Environment creation via gym.make(), environment reset, environment step, and environment render functions.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data is sent to external servers, files, or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input actions are taken via sample_action() and passed to step(); environment states and results flow through reset() and step() functions; render_frame() outputs visual data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of standard gymnasium API functions, which are legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a gym environment wrapper. It initializes environments, samples actions, performs environment steps, renders frames, and manages environment lifecycle. No external data is sent or received aside from the standard gymnasium API calls. No suspicious code patterns, such as network communications, data exfiltration, or obfuscation, are present. The code adheres to typical patterns for environment interaction and does not contain hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and benign wrapper around Gymnasium environments, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It purely facilitates environment interaction for reinforcement learning experiments.",
