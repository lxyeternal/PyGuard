{
  "purpose": "The code defines a wrapper class for interacting with Gymnasium environments, providing methods for environment control, sampling actions, and rendering frames.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy, gymnasium, and gymnasium wrappers; reads environment name, seed, and render mode from initialization parameters; uses environment's action and observation spaces; calls environment reset, step, render, and close methods.",
  "sinks": "Environment's reset, step, render, and close functions; action sampling and setting seed; environment creation with user-defined environment name.",
  "flows": "Initialization with environment name and seed → environment reset with seed → sampling actions from environment → environment step with action → rendering frames from environment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual dynamic code execution observed. Usage of standard gymnasium API with no obfuscated or misleading code. No network calls or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around gymnasium environments. It initializes environments with a given seed, handles environment reset and stepping, and provides methods for rendering and sampling actions. It does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All functions appear to utilize standard gymnasium API methods without any obfuscated or harmful constructs. The code's purpose is to facilitate environment interaction for reinforcement learning or simulation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment wrapper with no malicious intent or security concerns. It correctly uses the gymnasium API for environment management, with no signs of malware, data leaks, or malicious behavior.",
