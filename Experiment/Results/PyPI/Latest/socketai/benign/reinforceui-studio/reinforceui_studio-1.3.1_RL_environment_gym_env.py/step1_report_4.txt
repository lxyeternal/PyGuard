{
  "purpose": "Provide a wrapper interface for interacting with Gymnasium environments, including methods for reset, step, render, and sampling actions.",
  "sources": "gym.make() to instantiate environments, environment methods such as reset(), step(), render(), and action_space.sample() for input and data generation.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; the code interacts only with local environment objects and returns their data.",
  "flows": "Input from method parameters (env_name, seed, actions) flows into environment creation and interaction methods; environment data flows out as observations, rewards, frames, etc.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper for Gymnasium environments. It initializes environments, manages action and observation spaces, resets and steps through the environment, and renders frames. There are no indications of malicious logic, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The methods follow standard patterns for environment interaction. No external network calls, no hidden code, no suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign and standard wrapper for Gymnasium environments with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
