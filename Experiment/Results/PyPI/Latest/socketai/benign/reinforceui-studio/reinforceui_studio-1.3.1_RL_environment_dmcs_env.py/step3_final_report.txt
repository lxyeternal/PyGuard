  "purpose": "A wrapper class for DeepMind Control Suite environments, facilitating environment creation, sampling, stepping, rendering, and cleanup.",
  "sources": "Environment initialization via suite.load(), environment reset, and step functions; action sampling with np.random.uniform; rendering via env.physics.render.",
  "sinks": "Visualization with matplotlib (local display), no external data transmission or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input actions from sample_action() to env.step(); environment observations from env to reset() and step(); rendered frames from env.physics.render to render_frame().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard environment wrapper using official APIs and common libraries. It performs environment setup, action sampling, environment stepping, rendering, and cleanup without external communication or malicious logic. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code's behavior is benign, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation for interacting with DeepMind Control Suite environments. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the analysis.",
