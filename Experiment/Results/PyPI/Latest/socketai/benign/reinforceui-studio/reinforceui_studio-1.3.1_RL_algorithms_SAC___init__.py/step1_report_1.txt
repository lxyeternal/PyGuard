  "purpose": "Import the SAC class from the local module SAC for reinforcement learning or similar purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading the SAC class definition from the local module SAC",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data processing or external data handling present",
  "flows": "Import statement imports SAC class into the namespace; no data flow or untrusted data processing involved",
  "anomalies": "Single import statement; no suspicious or unusual code behavior or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a local module. It does not include any data handling, user input, network communication, or other potential security risks. The presence of the import alone does not indicate malicious intent. The import is marked with noqa comments to suppress linting warnings, which is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials, code execution, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple import of a local class, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase.",
