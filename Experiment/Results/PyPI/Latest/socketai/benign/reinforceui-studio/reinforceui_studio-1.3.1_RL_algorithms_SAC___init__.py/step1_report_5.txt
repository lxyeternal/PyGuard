{
  "purpose": "Import the SAC class from a local module named SAC.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module './SAC'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only imports a class.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; only a module import occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, just an import statement with no additional logic or data handling; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named SAC from a local module, likely part of a larger project. It contains no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or network operations. The import statement is standard practice in Python projects, and there are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Since this is only a fragment with no other logic, the potential for malicious behavior is very low.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement for a class from a local module, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a larger codebase.",
