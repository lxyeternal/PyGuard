  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The report correctly identifies that this is a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None detected; the analysis is accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard import.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, it's a simple import.\n- **Errors or flaws:** Correctly notes no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct, no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, just a relative import with no malicious signs.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower (0.9) but acceptable given the minimal code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous, a standard import.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, a simple import statement.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — the risk score is slightly above zero but still very low.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1, which is acceptable for such a benign import, but perhaps slightly conservative.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score could be slightly lowered to 0, but 0.1 is still reasonable given the minimal context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, benign import statement.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis, with the exception of report 5's risk score being marginally above zero, which is acceptable but could be lowered.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware scores:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly at 0.\n- **Risk scores:** All should be 0, given the benign nature, unless there's context outside these snippets suggesting otherwise.\n- **Confidence levels:** Appropriate, given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk from these import statements.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
