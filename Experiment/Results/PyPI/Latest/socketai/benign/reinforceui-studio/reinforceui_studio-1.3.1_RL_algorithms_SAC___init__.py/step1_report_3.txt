  "purpose": "Import the SAC class or module from the local SAC package for use within the current codebase.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .SAC import SAC, which reads the SAC module/class from a local package or directory.",
  "sinks": "The import operation itself; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or transmitted in this line.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads code from a local module; no data flow or execution flow beyond module loading occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains a simple relative import statement with no additional logic, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The line is a standard Python import statement using relative import syntax. It indicates the code depends on a local module or package named SAC. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. No input data handling or untrusted data processing occurs here. The minimal nature of this line suggests a straightforward import operation, typical in modular Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple relative import of the SAC class/module from a local package. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this line alone.",
