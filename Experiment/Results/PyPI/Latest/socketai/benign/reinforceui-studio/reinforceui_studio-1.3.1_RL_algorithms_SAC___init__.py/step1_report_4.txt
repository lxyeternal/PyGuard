  "purpose": "Import the SAC class from the local SAC module, likely for reinforcement learning algorithms.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module file 'SAC.py'. No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths since the code only contains an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; only an import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, or suspicious imports present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module file. It does not execute any functions, process data, or perform network operations. The import statement is standard in Python for modular code organization. There are no indications of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks in this single line.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard import used in Python projects.",
