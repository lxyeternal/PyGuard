  "purpose": "Import the SAC class from the SAC module in the same package for use within the project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.SAC'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; purely an import statement",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow, only import operation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import syntax with noqa comments for linting",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement bringing in the SAC class from a local module. The comments '# noqa: F401, D104' indicate linting suppressions for unused import and missing docstring, which are common in package __init__.py files or similar modules. No data input, no data output, and no execution of suspicious code are present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be standard package setup code.",
