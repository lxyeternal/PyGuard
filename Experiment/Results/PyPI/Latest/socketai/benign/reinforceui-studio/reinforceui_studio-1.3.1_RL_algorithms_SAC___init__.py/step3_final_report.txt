{
  "purpose": "Import the SAC class from a local module named SAC, likely for reinforcement learning purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or input handling involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The import flows from the local module SAC into the current namespace; no data flow beyond module import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard import statement with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of a class from a local module. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The import is typical in Python projects and does not involve any hardcoded secrets or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with scores reflecting no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is an overly cautious estimate, but still acceptable. Overall, the code presents no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, standard practice, and poses no security threat. The scores assigned are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score reflecting the minimal threat. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
