  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate RL logging utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only external dependency (save_models) could pose a risk if malicious, but this cannot be determined from this code alone. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the reports. No modifications are necessary."
