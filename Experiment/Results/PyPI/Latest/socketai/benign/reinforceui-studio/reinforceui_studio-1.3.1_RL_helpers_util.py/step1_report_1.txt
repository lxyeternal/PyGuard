{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for normalizing and denormalizing action values and setting random seeds for reproducibility in a machine learning context.",
  "sources": "Reading input values such as 'action', 'max_action_value', 'min_action_value', and 'seed' from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Setting random seeds using torch, numpy, and random modules, which can influence stochastic processes in ML training.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are used to compute normalized/denormalized values; seed values are used to initialize random number generators for reproducibility.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected. The functions perform standard normalization/denormalization and seed setting procedures. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward mathematical functions for normalization and denormalization, which are common in ML workflows. The seed setting function uses standard practices for reproducibility. No data leakage, malicious data handling, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving typical purposes in machine learning preprocessing and reproducibility. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
