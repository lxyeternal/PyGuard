{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for normalizing and denormalizing action values within a specified range and setting random seeds for reproducibility in experiments.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as 'action', 'max_action_value', 'min_action_value', and 'seed' for setting seeds.",
  "sinks": "Uses the inputs in mathematical calculations and sets seeds for various random number generators.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in normalization functions; the seed value influences random number generators for reproducibility.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments; functions perform straightforward mathematical and seed-setting operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of normalization and denormalization functions that perform basic linear transformations, and a seed-setting function that initializes multiple random number generators for reproducibility. The functions use input parameters directly without hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. There are no external network connections, system modifications, or data leaks. The code's logic is clear and typical for machine learning or simulation workflows. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for normalization and reproducibility, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
