  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, performing normalization, denormalization, and seed setting.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected in any report.\n- The code uses standard libraries and practices.\n- The functions are simple mathematical transformations and seed initializations, common in ML workflows.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:**  \n  The normalization and denormalization functions implement standard linear transformations. The seed setting function correctly initializes multiple RNGs for reproducibility.  \n  **No issues found.**\n\n- **Malware or malicious behavior:**  \n  The code does not perform any network activity, file manipulation, or data exfiltration. It simply manipulates numerical values and sets seeds.  \n  **Malware score of 0 is justified.**\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation detected.  \n  **Obfuscated score of 0 is justified.**\n\n- **Security risks:**  \n  No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The functions are safe and standard.  \n  **Security risk score of 0 is justified.**\n\n---\n\n### Scoring and Reasonableness:\n\n- The reports uniformly assign scores:  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n- These are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the reports' evaluations. The code is benign, standard utility code for ML workflows.\n\n**However,** to be thorough, I note that the normalization functions assume the input ranges are valid and do not include input validation or error handling. While this does not constitute malicious behavior, it could be considered a potential flaw in robustness, but not in security.\n\n**Therefore, my final scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code, with no hidden malicious intent or suspicious complexity.",
