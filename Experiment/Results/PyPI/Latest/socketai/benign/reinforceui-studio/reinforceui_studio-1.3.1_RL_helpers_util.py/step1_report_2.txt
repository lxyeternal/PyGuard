{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for normalizing and denormalizing action values and setting random seeds for reproducibility in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads seed value from input parameter in set_seed function; imports external libraries (torch, numpy, random).",
  "sinks": "Uses seed values with torch, numpy, and random libraries for setting random number generators; no other data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input seed flows into set_seed function, influencing torch, numpy, and random's RNG states; no other data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard normalization, denormalization, and seed setting routines without hidden or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of well-defined functions for normalization, denormalization, and seed setting. It imports standard libraries and utilizes them for reproducibility. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are present. The functions are straightforward and align with common machine learning practices. There are no network communications, file operations, or other suspicious behaviors. The code appears benign and intended for typical ML workflow support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for normalization and reproducibility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses common libraries and functions appropriately, with no anomalous or malicious patterns detected.",
