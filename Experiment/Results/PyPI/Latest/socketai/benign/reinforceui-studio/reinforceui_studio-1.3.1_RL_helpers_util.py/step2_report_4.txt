  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, the described logic, and the provided scores.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides straightforward normalization and denormalization functions based on linear transformations.\n- Includes a seed-setting function that initializes multiple random number generators for reproducibility.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communications are present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correctly describes the functions' intent and data flow.\n- **Anomalies & analysis:** No anomalies; functions are standard.\n- **Conclusion & confidence:** Benign, with confidence 1.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct; functions are for normalization, denormalization, and seed setting.\n- **Anomalies & analysis:** No anomalies; standard code.\n- **Conclusion & confidence:** Properly identified as benign.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & analysis:** No anomalies; standard functions.\n- **Conclusion & confidence:** Benign utility code.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & analysis:** No anomalies; functions are standard.\n- **Conclusion & confidence:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & analysis:** No anomalies; functions are straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & confidence:** Properly identified as benign.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risks.\n- The functions are standard, well-understood in ML workflows, and do not contain any suspicious behaviors.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security concerns.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
