  "purpose": "Provides normalization, denormalization, and seed setting functions for reproducibility in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for normalization/denormalization functions; seed value for set_seed function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions perform mathematical operations and seed initialization only.",
  "flows": "Input data (action values, seed) flows through functions to produce normalized/denormalized values or set random seeds.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard library usage and no suspicious or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard normalization and denormalization functions based on linear transformations, with seed setting for reproducibility. No suspicious behaviors, external communications, or malicious code are present. The functions do not handle untrusted input validation but assume correct usage. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected. The code is typical for ML utility modules, and all reports correctly identify it as benign. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for normalization and reproducibility, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
