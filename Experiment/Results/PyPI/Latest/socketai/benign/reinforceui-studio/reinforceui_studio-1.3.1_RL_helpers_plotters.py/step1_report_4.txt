{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate comparison plots and logs visualization for evaluation data of algorithms, primarily for analysis and presentation purposes.",
  "sources": "User-provided input includes 'algo_folders' dictionary for directory paths, 'logs' list for data, and 'output_file' paths for saving plots.",
  "sinks": "Saving plots to specified files; reading CSV files from given paths.",
  "flows": "Sources (input paths and logs) are used to read CSV data, which is then processed and plotted; the plots are saved to specified files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden functions are present. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious commands.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, os) for data visualization. It reads CSV files from specified paths, performs grouping operations, and generates line plots. There are warnings for missing files, but no operations that could be malicious. The functions are straightforward and focus on data plotting without executing external commands or network connections. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected. The code adheres to typical data visualization patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a visualization utility for evaluation logs. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The functions are standard and rely solely on publicly available libraries. No security risks or malware detected.",
