{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate comparison and logs plots from evaluation CSV files and logs, mainly for visual analysis of algorithm performance.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files from specified folder paths and logs data provided as a list of dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are image files saved to specified locations; no untrusted data is written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data is read from CSV files or logs, processed via pandas, and visualized with seaborn and matplotlib, then saved as images.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious code structures, no unusual dynamic code execution, and no hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, os) for plotting and file handling, with typical data processing steps like grouping and plotting. It performs file existence checks before reading CSV files to avoid errors. The plotting functions generate visualizations from provided data, saving them as images. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for plotting evaluation logs. It does not contain any malicious code or suspicious activity. The usage of external libraries and the absence of dynamic code execution or network operations suggest it is safe.",
