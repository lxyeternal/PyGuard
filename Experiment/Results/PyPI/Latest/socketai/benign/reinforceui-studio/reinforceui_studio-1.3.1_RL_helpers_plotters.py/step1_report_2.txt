{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate comparison plots and logs visualizations from evaluation data stored in CSV files and provided logs.",
  "sources": "File system reads from paths constructed using os.path.join and pandas.read_csv to load evaluation log CSV files.",
  "sinks": "Saving plots as image files using plt.savefig, which is a benign sink; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Sources (CSV file reads and provided logs) feed data into pandas DataFrame; data is processed and then plotted; plots are saved to files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. No suspicious commands, obfuscated code, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports common plotting and data handling libraries, performs file existence checks, reads CSV data into pandas DataFrames, processes data by grouping, and visualizes using seaborn and matplotlib. It saves generated plots to specified files and includes no malicious or suspicious operations. The functions are standard data visualization routines with no indication of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data visualization script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It only reads CSV files and logs data, then generates and saves plots. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious actions are detected.",
