{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate data visualization plots from CSV logs and logs data, primarily for comparing evaluation metrics across algorithms.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files from specified directories, and processes dataframes for plotting.",
  "sinks": "Saves generated plots as image files; no external network or data transmission occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads CSV files -> processes dataframes -> plots data -> saves images.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib) for data visualization. It performs file existence checks, reads CSV logs, groups data by 'Total Timesteps', and plots 'Average Reward' or specified columns. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with legitimate data analysis tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data visualization utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
