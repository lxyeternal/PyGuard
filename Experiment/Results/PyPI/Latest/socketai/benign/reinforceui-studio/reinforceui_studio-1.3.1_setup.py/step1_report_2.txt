  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'reinforceui-studio', configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' file, reading 'README.md' file, static data within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks; no network or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "Requirements read from file → used in install_requires; README content read for long_description.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup operations: reading dependencies, defining package metadata, and configuration. It uses standard library functions and well-known packaging practices without executing untrusted code or performing any network/system actions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
