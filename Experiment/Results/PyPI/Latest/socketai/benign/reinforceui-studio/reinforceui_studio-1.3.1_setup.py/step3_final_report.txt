  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools, reading dependencies and metadata from external files.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies and 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "External files are read into variables but not executed or processed dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, straightforward setup script that imports setuptools, reads dependencies and description from files, and calls setup() with standard parameters. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score is minimal (around 0.1), reflecting the low inherent risk of setup scripts. No signs of malicious intent or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
