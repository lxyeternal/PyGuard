  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of a Springer API search handler with no malicious intent or security risks. The minimal security risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified due to query string concatenation but does not constitute a security flaw. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent."
