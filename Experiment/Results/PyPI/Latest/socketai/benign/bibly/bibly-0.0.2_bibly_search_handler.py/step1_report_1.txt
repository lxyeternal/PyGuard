  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for search handlers with methods for initialization and performing searches.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'abc', 'typing', and 'bibly.utils.data_types'. No data input sources within the class itself.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data outputs, network connections, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows; abstract methods are placeholders with no implementation or data handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of modern Python features (type hints with union types) and an abstract class structure is standard. No suspicious or unusual code behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'SearchHandler' with two abstract methods: 'initialize' and 'search'. It imports standard modules and a custom data type. There are no data handling, network operations, or runtime logic that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious code features are present. Overall, the code is straightforward and appears to serve as a base class for further implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard abstract class definition for a search handler interface, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
