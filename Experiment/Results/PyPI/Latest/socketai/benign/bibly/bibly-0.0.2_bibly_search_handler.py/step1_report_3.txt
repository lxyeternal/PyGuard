  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for search handlers with initialization and search methods.",
  "sources": "None; the code imports modules and defines a class with method signatures, no input data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no processing of untrusted data or external data sources is present in this fragment.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears to be a standard abstract class definition without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a project-specific data type, defines an abstract class with two abstract methods. It lacks implementation details, data handling, or dynamic code execution. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The structure is typical for a plugin or extension system in a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward abstract class definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as an interface template for search handlers, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
