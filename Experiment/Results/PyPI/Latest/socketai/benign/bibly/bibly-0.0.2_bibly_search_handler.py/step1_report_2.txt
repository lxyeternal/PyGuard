  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for search handlers with methods for initialization and performing searches.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'abc', 'typing', and 'bibly.utils.data_types'. No external or user input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions are included.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines an interface.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of abstract base class pattern with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'SearchHandler' with two abstract methods, 'initialize' and 'search'. It uses standard Python typing and ABC constructs. No external data sources, user inputs, or output mechanisms are implemented. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. No obfuscated or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward abstract class definition for a search handler interface. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a standard, safe, and well-structured part of a larger application.",
