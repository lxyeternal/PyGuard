{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for search handler implementations with methods for initialization and search operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'abc', 'typing', and a local module 'bibly.utils.data_types'. No external input handling detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations. Methods are abstract and not implemented.",
  "flows": "No concrete data flows; the code only declares abstract methods without executing logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code. The use of type hints with 'Optional[str | int]' is standard for modern Python.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of an abstract class 'SearchHandler' with abstract methods 'initialize' and 'search'. No runtime or malicious behavior is present. No external data processing, network communication, or potentially harmful logic is included. The code is clean and adheres to standard practices for defining abstract base classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious abstract class definition with no signs of malware or security risks. It serves as a template for other classes to implement search functionality. No security concerns are identified.",
