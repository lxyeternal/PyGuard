  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for search handlers with methods to initialize and perform searches.",
  "sources": "Imports from abc, typing, and a project-specific SearchResult data type; no data input or external sources used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; abstract method signatures indicate intended source-to-sink paths but no actual data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python abstract base class with two abstract methods, serving as an interface. It imports common modules and a custom data type but contains no implementation, data handling, or dynamic behavior. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code does not perform any malicious actions, data leaks, or obfuscation. The type hints are modern and appropriate. No logical flaws or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface definition with no malicious or security-related issues. It poses no threat and is safe for use. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and consistent with the code's static, structural nature.",
