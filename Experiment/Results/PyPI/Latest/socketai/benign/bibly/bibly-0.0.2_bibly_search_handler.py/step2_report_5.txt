  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Data Handling**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a straightforward abstract class definition with no implementation, data processing, or external data handling. The class imports standard modules and a custom data type but does not perform any runtime logic, data flow, or network operations. There are no signs of code execution, dynamic code, or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Security Risks**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, citing the absence of suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, external inputs, or dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for interface definitions.\n\n3. **Obfuscation**  \nAll reports indicate no obfuscation, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Scores and Reasoning**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. This is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, consistent with the reports.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, as the code is purely an interface with no logic or data handling that could introduce security risks.\n\n5. **Potential Flaws or Logical Issues**  \nNo issues are identified. The code is a standard pattern for defining an abstract base class in Python.\n\n6. **Any Unreasonable Scores?**  \nAll reports are consistent and reasonable. The scores accurately reflect the absence of malicious or risky code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard abstract class with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. It serves as an interface template, which by itself does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are thorough and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustment is necessary.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's nature as a simple interface definition with no security concerns.",
