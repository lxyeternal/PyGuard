{
  "purpose": "Implement a handler for searching the Scopus database via the pybliometrics library, retrieving publication data based on queries.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as api_key, api_token, query, year_from, and year_to; self.api_key and self.api_token used internally.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems, files, or network; it primarily calls an external library and returns processed data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (api_key, api_token, query, year_from, year_to) flow into initialize() and search() methods; data flows into pybliometrics' init() and ScopusSearch(), and results are processed into SearchResult objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no suspicious or hidden network connections; no obfuscated code; no unusual dynamic execution; no unusual data handling or privacy violations.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes the pybliometrics library with provided API credentials, performs searches with user-defined query parameters, and processes results into a defined data structure. It uses standard library functions and clear logic without any suspicious behavior or code that appears malicious. There are no signs of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code adheres to typical patterns for API interaction and data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a search handler for the Scopus API, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external libraries for core functionality and handles data in a standard manner.",
