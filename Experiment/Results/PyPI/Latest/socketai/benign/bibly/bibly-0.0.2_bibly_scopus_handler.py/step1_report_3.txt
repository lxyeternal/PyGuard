{
  "purpose": "The code defines a handler for searching the Scopus database using provided API credentials.",
  "sources": "Reading API key and token from instance variables; reading query parameters; reading search results from the Scopus API",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is written to external systems or network connections beyond the API calls; no sensitive data is transmitted outside the intended API communication",
  "flows": "API key and token are used in the init function to initialize the API client; user-provided query parameters are used in constructing the search query; results are processed and returned in a structured format",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no hidden backdoors or malicious behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code securely initializes the API client using provided keys and tokens, with no hardcoded secrets. It constructs search queries based on input parameters, then processes results from the Scopus API. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code relies on standard library functions and external APIs as intended. It does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a search handler interfacing with the Scopus API. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. The overall security risk score is low.",
