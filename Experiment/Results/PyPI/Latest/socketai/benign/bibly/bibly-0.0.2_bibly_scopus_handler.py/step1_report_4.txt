{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python class for interfacing with the Scopus API to perform scholarly article searches and process results.",
  "sources": "Reads API key and token during initialization, and user-provided search query and optional year filters during search.",
  "sinks": "Uses the API key and token directly in the init() function, which is necessary for authorized API access; no other data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Source: API key/token and search query → sink: init() call and ScopusSearch request → output: list of SearchResult objects",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or unusual code patterns; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely initializes API credentials, performs straightforward API search requests, and structures results into data objects. No malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The only external data sources are the API credentials and search query, which are handled appropriately. No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for interacting with the Scopus API without malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious payloads. Overall, it is a safe, functional component for scholarly data retrieval.",
