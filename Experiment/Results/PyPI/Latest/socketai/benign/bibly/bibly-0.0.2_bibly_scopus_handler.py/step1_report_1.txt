{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class 'ScopusHandler' for interfacing with the Scopus API, performing search queries, and processing results.",
  "sources": "Reads API key and token from class attributes during initialization; reads 'query', 'year_from', and 'year_to' from method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'pybliometrics' library to perform API calls and process search results; no evident data sinks that leak untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "Input API credentials -> initialize API connection; user-provided 'query' and optional date filters -> construct search query -> fetch results -> process results into 'SearchResult' objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious functions; search query is constructed dynamically but safely. No unusual network activity or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a search handler class. It reads API keys and tokens securely from parameters, uses a reputable library for API calls, and processes results without malicious intent. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injections. The code follows standard practices for API interaction and data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and intended solely for interfacing with the Scopus API. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware is evident. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious anomalies detected.",
