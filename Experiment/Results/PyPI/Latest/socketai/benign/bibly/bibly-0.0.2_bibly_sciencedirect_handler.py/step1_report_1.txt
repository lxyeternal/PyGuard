{
  "purpose": "Provide a handler for searching ScienceDirect articles using API keys and tokens.",
  "sources": "Reading API key and token from instance variables, user input for query parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows into system vulnerabilities, no data leaks, or external untrusted data effects.",
  "flows": "API key/token used during initialization; query parameters used to generate search requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. Use of API keys and tokens appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a search handler with API credentials, performs a search query appending date constraints if provided, and processes results into a structured format. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity detected. The API key and token are passed as parameters and stored in instance variables, which is standard practice. The code relies on external libraries for API interaction and data processing, with no evidence of obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical API wrapper for scientific literature search functionality. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data flows. It functions as a legitimate search handler with proper parameter handling.",
