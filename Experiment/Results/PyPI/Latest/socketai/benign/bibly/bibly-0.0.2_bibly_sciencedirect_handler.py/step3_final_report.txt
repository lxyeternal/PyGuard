  "purpose": "API client for querying ScienceDirect articles using provided API credentials and search parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for API key, API token, and search query components.",
  "sinks": "Results returned as structured SearchResult objects; no data leaks or untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input credentials flow into init() for API setup; search query flows into ScienceDirectSearch; results flow into result processing and return.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with proper credential handling and no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes API credentials via parameters, performs a search with optional date filters, and processes results into structured objects. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. Minor note: date filter concatenation could be refined for partial dates, but this does not impact security. External library usage is standard. The code is well-structured and aligns with typical API client patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API wrapper for ScienceDirect with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2). The code is safe for supply chain purposes.",
