  "purpose": "Evaluate the security implications of a minimal import statement in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The import statement `from bibly.client import BibLy`",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in the code snippet",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only imports a class without executing further logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing `BibLy` from `bibly.client`. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. The import is standard, and without additional context or code execution, it poses no security risk. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score should be adjusted to 0, as an import alone does not introduce risk. Confidence in benignity is high, given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, involving only a standard import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. The existing scores are appropriate, except the security risk score should be set to 0 for accuracy.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
