  "purpose": "Importing the BibLy class from the bibly.client module, likely for bibliographic data handling or related functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement, which loads the BibLy class from an external module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this snippet; no data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow is observable in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident in the import statement alone.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement. No input reading, data processing, or network communication is present. As an isolated import, it does not pose any security risk or malicious behavior. The bibly module appears to be a third-party library, and importing a class from it is typical for using external libraries. Without further context or code, there are no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet only imports a class from a module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this limited fragment.",
