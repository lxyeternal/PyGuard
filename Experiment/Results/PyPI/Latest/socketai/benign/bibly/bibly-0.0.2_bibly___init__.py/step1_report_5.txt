  "purpose": "Import the BibLy class from the bibly.client module, likely to interact with a bibliographic or citation management system.",
  "sources": "The code imports a class from a third-party module; no input reading or data fetching observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks, data leaks, or untrusted data handling detected in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not enough code to establish data flow paths; only an import statement present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only an import statement with no additional context, which is not unusual but provides limited information.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal code snippet that imports a class named BibLy from the bibly.client module. It does not execute any functions, process data, or perform network operations. Since no other code is present, there are no apparent malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The import itself is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. Without additional context or code, it is not possible to identify malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign but incomplete for a thorough security analysis.",
