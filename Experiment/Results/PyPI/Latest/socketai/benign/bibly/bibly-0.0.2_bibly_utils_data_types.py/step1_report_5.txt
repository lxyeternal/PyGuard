  "purpose": "Define a data structure to hold search results from the Bibly API.",
  "sources": "Code imports (dataclasses, typing.Optional), class attribute definitions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; only data structure definition",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a dataclass definition for SearchResult, with optional string attributes. It imports standard modules, and there are no dynamic or external data manipulations. No functions, network calls, or data processing are present that could introduce security concerns. The structure appears straightforward and intended for data storage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, safe data class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
