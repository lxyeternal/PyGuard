{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class 'SearchResult' to structure search result data from the Bibly API.",
  "sources": "No input sources; data is defined via class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only declares a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only involves class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules 'dataclasses' and 'typing', then defines a simple dataclass with optional string attributes representing various metadata fields. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code constructs are present. The docstring contains an extra quote, but it is purely a documentation typo and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines a data structure with no active or malicious behavior. It appears safe and standard for defining a search result entity in Python.",
