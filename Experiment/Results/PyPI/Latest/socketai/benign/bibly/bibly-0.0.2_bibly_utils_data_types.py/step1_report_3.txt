  "purpose": "Define a data structure to represent search results from the Bibly API.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; only class definition.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines a data class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, defining a dataclass with optional fields.",
  "analysis": "The code imports dataclass and Optional typing, then defines a dataclass 'SearchResult' with several optional string fields. It includes a docstring that describes the class as representing a search result from the Bibly API. There are no functions, no data input/output, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets. The code is simple and standard for Python data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign definition of a data structure for API search results with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
