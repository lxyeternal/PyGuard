  "purpose": "Define a data structure for search results from the Bibly API with optional metadata fields.",
  "sources": "Import of standard modules 'dataclasses' and 'typing'; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "None; the code only declares a data class without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Minor documentation typo in the docstring (extra quote), but no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python dataclass with optional string fields, importing only standard modules. No input/output, network activity, dynamic code execution, or data processing occurs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The documentation typo is minor and non-security related. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The code's straightforward nature and lack of active behavior confirm its safety. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python data class defining optional metadata fields for search results. It contains no malicious or security-sensitive behavior. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
