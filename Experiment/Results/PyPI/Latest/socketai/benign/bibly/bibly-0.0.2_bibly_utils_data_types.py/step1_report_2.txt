  "purpose": "Define a data structure for search results from the Bibly API.",
  "sources": "Code imports ('dataclasses', 'typing') and the class definition that initializes data fields.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data output, network operations, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code simply defines a data class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a straightforward data class with optional string fields. It includes a docstring with a closing quotation mark that appears unbalanced but is part of the comment. There are no functions, external calls, or data processing logic. The code appears to be a simple data container without any malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python data class with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
