{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure for representing search results from the Bibly API.",
  "sources": "Input data from external sources such as API responses or user inputs, typically mapped to the fields of the SearchResult class.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, data could be outputted to logs, user interfaces, or transmitted over networks if not sanitized.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external sources into the SearchResult dataclass; no active data processing or transmission shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; the code strictly defines a data structure with no executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'dataclass' and 'Optional', then declares a dataclass 'SearchResult' with several optional string fields. The class includes a docstring describing its purpose. There is no executable code, data handling, or network operations present. The structure appears straightforward, and no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data class definition intended for storing search result data. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured piece of code.",
