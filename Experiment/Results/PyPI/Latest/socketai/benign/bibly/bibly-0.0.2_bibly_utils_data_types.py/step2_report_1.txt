  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward Python dataclass defining optional string fields for search result metadata.\n- No input/output operations, network calls, dynamic code execution, or data processing are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The only minor issue noted is a typo in the docstring (an extra quote), which is purely a documentation typo and not malicious.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n**Issue confirmation:**\n- The code matches the description: it is a simple data container with no active or malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- Malware score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- Security risk score is 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are detected.\n\n**Potential points of contention:**\n- The reports do not identify any issues that warrant a higher risk score. Given the code's nature, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The only minor point is the docstring typo, which does not impact security.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThere are no indications of malicious intent or security concerns in this code snippet.",
