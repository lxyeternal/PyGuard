{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class BibLy that initializes and manages search handlers for academic data sources and performs searches based on user queries.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: scopus_key, scopus_token, springer_key; used in __init__ for API handler initialization.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to handler initialization; search method passing query parameters to external handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected. The code appears to be straightforward API wrapper logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes handler objects with optional API keys, which are passed as input parameters. The search method calls search functions on these handlers with user-provided queries and date filters. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present. There are no hardcoded credentials or insecure operations. The code relies on external handler classes, which are not shown but assumed to be standard API wrappers. Overall, the structure is simple and secure, with no signs of malicious activity or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper class with no malicious behavior detected. It securely manages optional API keys and performs searches through external handlers without any suspicious logic or data leaks.",
