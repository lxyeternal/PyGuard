{
  "purpose": "A straightforward API wrapper class for academic data sources, initializing handlers with optional API keys and performing searches.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to constructor (scopus_key, scopus_token, springer_key); method arguments (query, year_from, year_to).",
  "sinks": "Delegation of search queries to external handler methods; no direct sinks or data leaks within this code.",
  "flows": "Constructor parameters (API keys) initialize handlers; search method forwards query and date filters to handlers; results are aggregated.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured API wrapper that initializes external handlers with optional API keys and performs searches. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The API keys are passed as parameters, not hardcoded, reducing risk. The external handler classes are assumed to be standard API wrappers. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk. The high confidence score (0.9) is justified given the clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, secure, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary; it is a safe API wrapper with minimal security considerations outside external handler trustworthiness.",
