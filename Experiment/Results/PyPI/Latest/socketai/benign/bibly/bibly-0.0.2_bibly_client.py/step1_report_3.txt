{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for interfacing with multiple academic search APIs (Scopus, ScienceDirect, Springer) to perform search queries.",
  "sources": "API keys and tokens provided via constructor parameters; class attributes initialized with these keys.",
  "sinks": "The constructor initializes API handler objects with the provided API keys/tokens, which could be used in API calls.",
  "flows": "API keys flow from constructor parameters into API handler objects; search method calls search functions on these handlers, passing query parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data embedded in code; no unusual code structures or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes API handler classes with optional keys and tokens, then uses these handlers to perform searches. The keys are passed as parameters, and only stored in instance attributes, which are used in subsequent API calls. No secret or sensitive data is hardcoded. There are no suspicious data flows, obfuscated code, or signs of malicious intent. The code structure appears straightforward and intended for normal API interaction.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of a search interface to academic databases, with no malicious behavior detected. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or security issues are present. The only potential concern could be misuse of API keys if they are compromised externally, but that is outside the scope of this code review.",
