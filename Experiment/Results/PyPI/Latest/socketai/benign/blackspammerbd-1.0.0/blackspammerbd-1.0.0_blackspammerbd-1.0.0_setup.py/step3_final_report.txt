  "purpose": "Standard Python setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata, entry points, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads package name, version, packages via find_packages(), install_requires list, entry_points for console scripts, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'bsb_module:main' via console script; no direct untrusted data sinks within this script.",
  "flows": "Setup configuration data flows from setup() parameters to package installation and script registration; actual runtime behavior depends on external 'bsb_module'.",
  "anomalies": "Package name 'blackspammerbd' is suspiciously spammy or malicious-sounding but not malicious in code; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious logic or obfuscation. The only concern is the package name, which could be used for spam or malicious distribution outside this script. The execution depends on 'bsb_module', which is outside the scope of this code. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code and assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) due to the package name suspicion. The scores are consistent with the code content and the external dependency's unknown nature.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard; no signs of malicious behavior are present within this code. The primary concern is the package name, which warrants external scrutiny but does not indicate malicious code here. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
