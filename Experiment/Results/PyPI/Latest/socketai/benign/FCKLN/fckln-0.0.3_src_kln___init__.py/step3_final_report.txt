{
  "purpose": "Import classes/functions from a local module 'kln' related to model configuration or conditional logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it performs a static import from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; no data leaks or external communications occur.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of two symbols from a local module 'kln'. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The import is standard practice in Python projects, especially in modular or ML-related codebases. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of this snippet. No external data, network activity, or suspicious patterns are detected. Given the minimal context, the risk remains very low, and the code appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
