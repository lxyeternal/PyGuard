{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes or functions from a local module named 'kln', likely for use in building or managing flexible conditional models.",
  "sources": "The source is the local module '.kln', which provides the imported classes/functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; it only performs imports.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'kln' module to the current namespace via imports; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a relative module, indicating modular code organization. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or unusual patterns. The imported items are likely intended for model creation or configuration, and no external data or user input is involved in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a normal import statement for modular Python code.",
