  "purpose": "Import specific classes and functions from the local module 'kln' for use in the current code context.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.kln' to import 'FlexibleConditional' and 'create_flexible_model'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only static imports are shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and appears to be a simple import statement with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic import statement importing two items from a relative module named 'kln'. There is no evidence of code execution, obfuscation, malicious behavior, or unusual patterns. The import appears standard and typical for Python projects, and no hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a larger codebase where 'kln' provides relevant classes and functions.",
