{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes and functions from a module named 'kln', likely for model creation or configuration within a larger machine learning project.",
  "sources": "The source is an import statement from a local or package module '.kln'. No input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code fragment; it only performs an import operation.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows in this minimal code snippet as it only imports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, with no apparent anomalies or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two components from a module named 'kln'. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. Given the limited scope, there is no evidence of malicious activity. However, without additional context about 'kln', potential concerns could relate to whether this module contains malicious code, but based on this snippet alone, there is no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a larger application or package. Due to the minimal content, confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
