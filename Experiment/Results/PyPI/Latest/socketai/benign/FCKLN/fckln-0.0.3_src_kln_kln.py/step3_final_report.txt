  "purpose": "A neural network module for modeling structured conditional dependencies with a blend of linear and nonlinear paths.",
  "sources": "Input tensors 'i' and 'j' concatenated and processed through linear and nonlinear layers.",
  "sinks": "Output tensor generated from blended linear and nonlinear transformations; no external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Inputs 'i' and 'j' -> concatenation -> linear and nonlinear layers -> blending via alpha -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard PyTorch neural network component with a learnable blending parameter. It performs straightforward operations without external data leaks, network activity, or malicious constructs. Multiple reviews confirm its benign nature, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's transparency and simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured ML module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The supply chain risk is negligible.",
  "confidence": 1,
