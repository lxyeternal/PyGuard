  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for a Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields, including name, version, packages, dependencies, author info, and entry_points.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'blackspammerbd_bsb.cli:main' when CLI command 'bsb' is invoked.",
  "flows": "User runs 'bsb' command -> invokes 'blackspammerbd_bsb.cli:main' function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or anomalies detected in setup.py.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py is a straightforward configuration script with no executable logic beyond metadata declaration. The entry point references a main function in a CLI module, which could contain malicious code, but that is outside the scope of this script. The package name appears suspicious but does not affect the code's benign nature. All security signals indicate no malicious intent or obfuscation within this setup script. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is minimal, around 0.1-0.2, primarily due to the package name suspicion. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and standard structure of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign configuration script with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security concern depends on the implementation of the CLI command, which is not provided. Based solely on this code, the package is low risk, and scores are appropriate.",
