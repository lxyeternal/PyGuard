  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment indicating package initialization; no executable code, data processing, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The snippet consists solely of a comment describing the package's purpose. There is no executable code, data handling, or potentially malicious constructs. The absence of any functional code makes it impossible to identify sources, sinks, or flows. This minimal code does not exhibit any suspicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears to be a simple package initialization comment with no executable content. Therefore, the code is considered benign.",
