  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward file management utility with no malware or obfuscation. Its primary security issue is lack of filename validation and access control, which could be exploited maliciously but does not constitute malware. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), consistent with the reports. No modifications are necessary."
