  "purpose": "Import the BlackSpammerBD class from a local module named core",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow present in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; potential for malicious behavior depends on the implementation of BlackSpammerBD in core",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a relative import of a class named BlackSpammerBD from a module called core. It does not include any executable code, input handling, data processing, or network operations. The malicious potential or security risk cannot be determined solely from an import statement; it depends entirely on the implementation of BlackSpammerBD in the core module. Without additional context, there are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies apparent here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no inherent malicious behavior. The risk depends on the implementation of the imported class, which is not provided. No immediate security concerns are evident from this snippet alone.",
