  "purpose": "CLI tool for file listing, encoding, decoding, and connection code management.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'connection_code.txt', target files specified in arguments, user input through command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writes connection code to 'connection_code.txt', writes base64-encoded data to a '.b64' file, writes decoded data to 'uploaded_' prefixed files, prints output to console.",
  "flows": "Generating a code (start_command) -> saving to file -> reading for connection validation (connect_command) -> listing directory -> encoding files (download_command) -> decoding files (upload_command).",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.randint for connection code; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; base64 encoding is benign; no apparent network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious commands. No obfuscation or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script provides straightforward file operations: listing directory contents, encoding files in base64, decoding base64 files, and managing a simple connection code stored locally. The code does not include network communications, external data transmission, or execution of external commands beyond basic file I/O and printing. Random connection code generation is benign. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Usage of the 'colorama' library is for user interface enhancement. Overall, the code appears to serve as a utility tool with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for managing a simple connection code and encoding/decoding files. There are no signs of malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks within this code. It operates solely on local files and directory listings without network interactions or sensitive data leakage.",
