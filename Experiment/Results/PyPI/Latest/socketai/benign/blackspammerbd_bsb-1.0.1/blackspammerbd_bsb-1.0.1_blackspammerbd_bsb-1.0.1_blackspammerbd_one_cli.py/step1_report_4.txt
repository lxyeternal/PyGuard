  "purpose": "A CLI tool for generating, verifying, listing, encoding, and decoding files, possibly for file transfer or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments (command and optional argument), file reads (connection code, files to encode/decode), environment variables not used.",
  "sinks": "File writes (connection code, encoded/decoded files), console output, base64 encoding/decoding.",
  "flows": "User command inputs trigger file reads/writes and encoding/decoding processes; the connection code is stored in a file and later read for verification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials; use of random for connection code is benign. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No network activity or system commands are used.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic file operations, connection code generation, and verification. It uses 'random' for code generation, which is not cryptographically secure but not malicious in itself. File handling, base64 encoding/decoding, and command parsing are standard. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are present. The code could be misused to obfuscate or transfer files covertly but does not inherently perform malicious actions. No external network connections, no credential theft, and no suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign utility for managing connection codes and encoding/decoding files. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The primary concern is potential misuse for covert file transfer or obfuscation, but these are not malicious by themselves.",
