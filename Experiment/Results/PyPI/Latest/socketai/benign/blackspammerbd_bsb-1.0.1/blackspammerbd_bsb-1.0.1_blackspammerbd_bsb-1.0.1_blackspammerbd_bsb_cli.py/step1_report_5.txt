  "anomalies": [
    "Use of random.randint() for connection code generation without cryptographic security",
    "No encryption or authentication for the connection process",
    "Potentially unsafe file handling (e.g., decoding arbitrary base64 files without validation)",
    "No input sanitization beyond existence checks, but no direct command injection risks",
    "No external network activity or system commands executed, reducing malware likelihood"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script functions as a simple CLI utility with commands for generating and verifying a connection code, listing files, and encoding/decoding files using base64. It relies solely on standard Python libraries and file operations. The code does not include any network activity, system command execution, or external data exfiltration mechanisms. While it handles sensitive operations like encoding and decoding files, these are performed locally with straightforward base64 methods. The connection code generation using 'random' is insecure for cryptographic purposes but does not pose an immediate malware threat. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility, with some minor security concerns about its use in sensitive contexts, but no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic file management utility with connection code handling, encoding, and decoding features. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or malware. Its security risks are minimal, mainly related to its simplistic random code generation and lack of authentication. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration are present.",
