  "purpose": "CLI tool for generating, verifying, listing, encoding, and decoding files and connection codes.",
  "sources": "Reading user input (command line arguments), reading/writing 'connection_code.txt', reading and writing files for encoding/decoding.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'connection_code.txt', reading from 'connection_code.txt', reading and writing files for Base64 encoding/decoding, printing outputs.",
  "flows": "Input commands from CLI -> file operations (reading/writing) -> Base64 encoding/decoding, user feedback.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Usage of random for code generation is acceptable for non-security-critical purposes. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution. No suspicious network activity or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of command-line utilities for managing connection codes and encoding files. It uses random number generation for codes, basic file operations for storing and retrieving the code and encoded data, and standard libraries for encoding. No network activity, system commands, or sensitive data handling beyond simple file I/O is present. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected. All functions appear straightforward and benign, aligned with typical file and encoding operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for encoding files and managing simple connection codes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The use of random for code generation is benign in this context, and there are no signs of malware or suspicious activities.",
