  "purpose": "Utility script for managing connection codes, listing directory contents, and encoding/decoding files in Base64.",
  "sources": "Reading connection code from 'connection_code.txt', listing current directory with os.listdir('.'), reading files for encoding/decoding, and accepting user input via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writing connection code to 'connection_code.txt', writing encoded data to '<file>.b64', writing decoded data to 'uploaded_<file>', and printing output messages.",
  "flows": "Generation of code via random.randint() -> saving to file; verification by reading saved code -> comparing with user input; encoding/decoding files via base64 -> writing output files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.randint() for connection code, which is predictable and not cryptographically secure; lack of filename sanitization in file operations; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file and directory operations, connection code management, and Base64 encoding/decoding. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of random.randint() for code generation is insecure but not malicious. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is detected. Minor security concerns relate to filename handling and weak randomness, but these do not constitute malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility with no malware or malicious activity. The minor security issues are typical for such scripts and do not elevate the overall risk. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior.",
