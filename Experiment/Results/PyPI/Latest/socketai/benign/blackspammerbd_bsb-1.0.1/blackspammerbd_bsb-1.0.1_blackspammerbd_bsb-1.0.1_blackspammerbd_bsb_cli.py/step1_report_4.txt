{
  "purpose": "Provide a CLI tool for generating, verifying, listing, encoding, and decoding files with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line arguments, reads and writes files ('connection_code.txt', specified files), reads directory contents with os.listdir().",
  "sinks": "Writes to 'connection_code.txt', writes encoded/decoded files, prints output messages.",
  "flows": "User commands (start, connect, list, download, upload) read inputs (codes, filenames), which lead to file read/write operations and output messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret keys. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual variable names. No hidden network activity, no system command executions beyond standard library calls. Use of base64 encoding/decoding is standard for data handling.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a command-line interface for generating and verifying a simple connection code stored locally, listing files, and encoding/decoding files with base64. All operations are local file manipulations and straightforward I/O. No network communication, no system command execution beyond os and standard library calls, no hidden or suspicious behavior. The code appears well-structured, and the functions perform common, benign tasks related to file handling and simple encoding. No evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of base64 is standard for encoding, with no apparent malicious intent. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for file handling and simple code generation without any malicious behavior. It does not contain malware or suspicious operations. It appears safe based on the provided code.",
