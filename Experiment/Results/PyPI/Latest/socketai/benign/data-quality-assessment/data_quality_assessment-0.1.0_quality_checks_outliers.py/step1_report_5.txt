{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to detect outliers in numerical columns of a pandas DataFrame using either the IQR or Z-score method.",
  "sources": "The function reads data from the input DataFrame 'df', specifically selecting numeric columns for analysis.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs a dictionary containing details about outliers; no untrusted data is written or transmitted outside the environment.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> Numeric column selection -> Outlier detection calculations -> Outliers result dictionary",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It uses standard pandas/numpy functions and standard outlier detection algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical outlier detection using statistical methods. It selects numeric columns, skips all-missing columns, and applies either IQR or Z-score calculations to identify outliers. It then compiles a report on outlier count, percentage, min, and max for each column with outliers. No malicious code, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation features are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of outlier detection in pandas DataFrames. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate data analysis function without security concerns.",
