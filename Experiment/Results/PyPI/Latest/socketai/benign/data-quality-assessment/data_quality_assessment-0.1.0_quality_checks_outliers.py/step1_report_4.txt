{
  "purpose": "The code detects outliers in numeric columns of a DataFrame using either the IQR or Z-score method.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the DataFrame 'df' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data to affect external systems, leak data, or execute commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the DataFrame 'df' into outlier detection calculations, and results are stored in a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The function selects numeric columns from the provided DataFrame, iterates over each, and calculates outliers based on the specified method. It skips columns with all missing values, uses standard statistical formulas for outlier detection, and compiles a result dictionary with outlier statistics per column. No external inputs, network communications, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code's logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard statistical outlier detection implementation with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It performs data analysis without security risks.",
