{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to detect outliers in numeric columns of a pandas DataFrame using either the IQR or Z-score method.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame 'df' provided as a parameter, reading data from DataFrame columns.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not write, transmit, or leak data externally or perform any operations that could cause data leakage or harm.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrame columns through statistical calculations, with results stored in a local dictionary; no external or unsafe operations are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code uses standard statistical methods for outlier detection with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common data analysis libraries pandas and numpy, and defines a function for outlier detection. It calculates outliers using standard statistical methods—interquartile range (IQR) or Z-score—based solely on the input DataFrame. The process involves selecting numeric columns, skipping columns with all missing values, computing bounds, and identifying outliers. The results are returned as a dictionary containing counts and statistics of detected outliers. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The logic is straightforward, and the functions are used in a typical manner consistent with data analysis tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate statistical analysis for outlier detection and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It uses standard pandas and numpy functions without any harmful side effects or security risks.",
