  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**  \n   - **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code performs standard outlier detection using pandas and numpy, with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. These seem appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n   - **Conclusion:** No issues. The code is legitimate, and the report's reasoning is sound.\n\n2. **Report 2**  \n   - **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms the code's benign nature, standard statistical calculations, and lack of malicious intent.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. These are reasonable.  \n   - **Conclusion:** The report is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n3. **Report 3**  \n   - **Assessment:** Again, it describes the code as a typical outlier detection function with no signs of malicious activity.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. Appropriate.  \n   - **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n4. **Report 4**  \n   - **Assessment:** Same as above, confirms standard data analysis logic, no suspicious patterns.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. Appropriate.  \n   - **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n5. **Report 5**  \n   - **Assessment:** Also consistent with the previous reports, indicating a standard implementation with no malicious behavior.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. Reasonable.  \n   - **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, legitimate implementation of outlier detection.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable given the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThe code is a standard, safe data analysis utility with no security concerns.",
