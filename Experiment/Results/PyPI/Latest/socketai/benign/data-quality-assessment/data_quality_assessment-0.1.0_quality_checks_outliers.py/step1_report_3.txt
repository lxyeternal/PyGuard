{
  "purpose": "The code aims to detect outliers in numeric columns of a pandas DataFrame using either the IQR or Z-score method.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a pandas DataFrame passed as an argument to the function, specifically targeting numeric columns within the DataFrame.",
  "sinks": "The code processes data internally and returns a dictionary with outlier statistics; there are no sinks that send data externally or to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input DataFrame through the selection of numeric columns, calculation of outliers via statistical methods, and results stored in a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears standard for outlier detection; no obfuscation or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports well-known libraries pandas and numpy, then defines a function to detect outliers using standard statistical methods. It processes only numeric data, calculates bounds for outliers, and counts them, returning a summary. There are no signs of malicious intent such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code operates solely within data analysis context with typical methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data analysis function for outlier detection with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is safe for use in data processing pipelines.",
