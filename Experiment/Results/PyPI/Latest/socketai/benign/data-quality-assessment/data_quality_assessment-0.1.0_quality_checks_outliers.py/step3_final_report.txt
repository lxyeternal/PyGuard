  "purpose": "Detect outliers in numeric columns of a pandas DataFrame using IQR or Z-score methods.",
  "sources": "Reads all numeric columns in the DataFrame; skips columns with all missing values.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, file I/O, or network calls; operates solely in-memory.",
  "flows": "Selects numeric columns -> Calculates bounds based on method -> Identifies outliers -> Records statistics in result dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward, with standard statistical calculations and no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pandas and numpy, then defines a function to detect outliers in a DataFrame. It selects numeric columns, skips all-missing columns, and for each, computes outlier bounds using either IQR or Z-score. It identifies outliers outside these bounds and records count, percentage, min, and max. The implementation uses standard pandas/numpy functions and statistical formulas, with no external data transmission, secrets, or obfuscation. The logic is clear, deterministic, and typical for data analysis. No malicious behavior, security vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for outlier detection with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly assess it as safe, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence in this conclusion is 1.0. The code is transparent and free of obfuscation, and no malicious behavior is detected.",
