{
  "purpose": "The code detects outliers in numeric columns of a pandas DataFrame using either the IQR or Z-score method.",
  "sources": "The function reads data from the DataFrame's numeric columns, specifically accessing columns and their statistical properties (quantiles, mean, std).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is written or transmitted; the code only performs statistical analysis within the DataFrame and returns a dictionary of outliers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from DataFrame columns (sources) through calculations (quantiles, mean/std) to the identification of outliers, which are then summarized in the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code performs standard outlier detection calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pandas and numpy, then defines a function to detect outliers based on user-selected method ('iqr' or 'z-score'). It identifies numeric columns and skips columns with all missing values. For each numeric column, it calculates the bounds for outliers using the specified method. It then filters outliers and stores their count, percentage, min, and max in a result dictionary. The implementation uses standard statistical formulas and pandas/numpy functions without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate statistical utility for outlier detection in data analysis workflows. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It is a straightforward implementation of outlier detection methods.",
