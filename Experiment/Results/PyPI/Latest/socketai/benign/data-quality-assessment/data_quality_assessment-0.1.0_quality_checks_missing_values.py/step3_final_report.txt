  "purpose": "Analyze missing values in a pandas DataFrame by calculating missing counts and percentages per column, then returning a sorted summary.",
  "sources": "The DataFrame input 'df' read from external data, accessed via df.isnull().sum() and len(df).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only processes the DataFrame internally without external outputs or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> isnull().sum() -> compute missing percentages -> create and sort summary DataFrame -> return summary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of pandas functions with clear logic. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pandas and numpy, defines a function to analyze missing data, calculates missing counts and percentages, creates a DataFrame with this info, sorts it by missing percentage, and returns it. It performs standard data inspection without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The code is simple, transparent, and aligns with typical data analysis practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for missing data analysis in pandas. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
