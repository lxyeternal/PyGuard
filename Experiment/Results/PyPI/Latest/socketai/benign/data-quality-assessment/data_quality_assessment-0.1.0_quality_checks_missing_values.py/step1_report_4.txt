{
  "purpose": "The code analyzes missing values in a pandas DataFrame by calculating and summarizing missing data counts and percentages per column.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input DataFrame 'df' passed to the function 'analyze_missing_values'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked; the code only performs data analysis on a DataFrame.",
  "flows": "Input 'df' is used in isnull().sum() and len(df) to compute missing data metrics, then summarized into a new DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pandas and numpy, defines a function to analyze missing values, computes missing data counts and percentages, and sorts the results. It performs standard data analysis tasks without any obfuscated or malicious constructs. No external data, network activity, or secret handling is involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data analysis utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a legitimate purpose of missing data analysis and does not include any malicious or suspicious components.",
