  "purpose": "The code is designed to analyze missing values in a pandas DataFrame, calculating and summarizing the count and percentage of missing data per column.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the DataFrame parameter 'df' via 'df.isnull().sum()', 'len(df)', and 'df.columns'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a DataFrame 'missing_summary' that contains the analysis results; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the parameter 'df' into calculations of missing values; the results are stored in 'missing_summary'.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; all functions and operations are standard pandas procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pandas and numpy, defines a function to analyze missing data in a DataFrame, calculates missing counts and percentages, creates a summary DataFrame, and sorts it. All operations are typical data analysis tasks with no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for missing data analysis with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
