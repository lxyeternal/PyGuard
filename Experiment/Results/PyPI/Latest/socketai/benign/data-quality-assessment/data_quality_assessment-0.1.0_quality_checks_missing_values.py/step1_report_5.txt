{
  "purpose": "The code analyzes missing values in a pandas DataFrame by calculating missing counts and percentages for each column.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame 'df' provided as a function argument; pandas methods 'isnull', 'sum', 'len', and DataFrame columns.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code processes data internally without outputting untrusted data or performing external actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input DataFrame through 'isnull' and 'sum' to compute missing counts, then to calculate percentages, and finally constructs a sorted summary DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected. The code appears straightforward and typical for data analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to analyze missing data in a pandas DataFrame. It calculates missing value counts and percentages per column, creates a summary DataFrame, and sorts it by missing percentage. All operations are standard pandas procedures for data inspection. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious external interactions. The code is well-structured and serves a common data analysis purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs standard missing data analysis using pandas. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks present.",
