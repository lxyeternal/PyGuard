{
  "purpose": "The code analyzes missing values in a pandas DataFrame, providing counts and percentages per column.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'df' parameter passed into the function 'analyze_missing_values'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not output data to external sources or perform any actions that could lead to data leakage or harm.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameter 'df' into computations for missing counts and percentages, then into a summary DataFrame, which is sorted and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. Usage of pandas and numpy libraries is standard and appropriate for data analysis tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pandas and numpy, defines a function to compute missing value counts and percentages, and returns a sorted summary DataFrame. All operations are standard for data analysis with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no external network connections, no data exfiltration, and no code that could be malicious. The function purely performs statistical summary calculations on the provided DataFrame.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data analysis function with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs common pandas operations safely and without suspicious activity.",
