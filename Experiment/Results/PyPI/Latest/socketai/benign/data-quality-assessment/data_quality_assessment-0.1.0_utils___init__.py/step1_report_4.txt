  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a general utility or application logic, but without specific context or documentation, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or files if imported. Specific sources cannot be identified without the code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file system operations, or execution functions. However, these are not explicitly detailed in the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or parameters through processing functions, potentially leading to outputs or external interactions like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are detected. Lack of comments or documentation makes intent ambiguous.",
  "analysis": "A detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed due to the absence of specific code content. Generally, the code structure appears standard, with no clear indicators of malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious external calls are evident in the description.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or security risks. However, due to limited visibility into the actual implementation, this assessment has low confidence.",
