  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple script that performs data processing or transformation, possibly related to user input or external data sources.",
  "sources": "Reads data from standard input (e.g., input() or sys.stdin), environment variables, or imported files.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to standard output, logs, or external files; uses network connections or subprocesses.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input/env/ files) through processing functions to sinks (output/logs/network).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library functions for input and output without suspicious modifications. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or covert channels. The structure and format are typical of simple utility scripts. Absence of dynamic code execution, obfuscated strings, or unusual patterns suggests low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It seems to serve a legitimate purpose without exposing security vulnerabilities.",
