  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, subprocess calls, input/output data handling, module imports",
  "sinks": "System calls via subprocess, environment variables used in system commands, data output streams",
  "flows": "Source inputs (environment variables, user input) to system calls or data outputs",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network or file operations; potential risk in environment variable usage",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify low or zero malware and obfuscation scores, with cautious security risk scores (mostly 0.2 to 0.4). No concrete malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The risk primarily stems from potential misuse of environment variables and system calls, but no evidence confirms malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the descriptions and reasoning provided. The overall assessment indicates minimal threat, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 justified by the potential for untrusted inputs to be exploited in certain contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk scores are appropriately cautious, reflecting potential misuse in untrusted environments but no confirmed malicious activity. Scores are consistent across reports, and no revisions are necessary based on current information.",
