  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, patterns indicating obfuscation, network activity, use of eval or dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports or functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, data exfiltration points, eval/dynamic code execution, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or code patterns leading to sinks like network or file operations, possibly via eval or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Opacity of code, use of eval or dynamic execution, minimal or vague variable naming, lack of comments, potential but unconfirmed dynamic evaluation functions.",
  "analysis": "The code reviews across reports consistently indicate no concrete evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The absence of suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns supports a benign assessment. Slight concerns about code opacity and potential eval usage are noted but not confirmed, leading to conservative risk scores. Confidence levels vary but generally support the benign conclusion. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), aligning with the cautious but positive evaluations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the comprehensive review, the code appears benign with no detected malicious behavior or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal, and the scores reflect a cautious but justified confidence in the code's safety.",
