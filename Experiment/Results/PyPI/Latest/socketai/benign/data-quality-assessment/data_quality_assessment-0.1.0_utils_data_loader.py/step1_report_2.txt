{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to load data from different file formats (CSV, Excel, JSON) into a pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from a file object or filename string, particularly from 'file_obj' parameter, and infers file type based on filename extension if not provided.",
  "sinks": "The code calls pandas functions (read_csv, read_excel, read_json) with the provided file object or filename, which could potentially process untrusted input data.",
  "flows": "Input data (file_obj) is received; file type is inferred from filename or explicitly provided; data is then loaded using pandas functions that read the content from the file object or filename.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code performs standard file type inference based on filename extension, and uses pandas I/O functions appropriately. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to load data from various file formats with flexible inference of file type based on filename extension if not specified. It utilizes pandas library functions for reading CSV, Excel, and JSON data, passing either a file object or filename to these functions. The code includes exception handling for unknown file types. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues such as unsafe data handling or code injection. The only potential concern is if untrusted files are processed without validation, but this is typical for data loading functions and outside the scope of malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data loading utility with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It relies on pandas for file parsing and does not contain any suspicious logic or behavior. Overall, the code appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
