{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load data from files of various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON) into pandas DataFrames.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'file_obj' parameter, which can be a file object or a filename string; it infers the file type from filename extension if not provided.",
  "sinks": "The code passes 'file_obj' directly to pandas' read functions, which are standard library functions; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input (file_obj or filename) -> inference of file type -> pandas read functions -> DataFrame output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no code obfuscation, no use of eval or exec, and no unusual or malicious logic detected. The filename extension inference is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file loading operations with type inference based on filename extensions. It uses pandas functions that handle reading different file formats. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The only potential concern is reliance on filename extension for type inference, which is common and not inherently risky. Overall, the code appears benign and standard for data loading tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data loading utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. It safely reads files into pandas DataFrames based on filename extension or explicit type. Therefore, it is considered safe.",
