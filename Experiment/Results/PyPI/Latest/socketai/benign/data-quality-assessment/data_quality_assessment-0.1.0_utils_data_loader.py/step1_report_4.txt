{
  "purpose": "This code loads data from files in various formats (csv, excel, json) into pandas DataFrames, primarily for data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a file object or file path provided as 'file_obj'. It also inspects 'file_obj.filename' if available to infer the file type.",
  "sinks": "The code uses pandas' read_csv, read_excel, and read_json functions to parse the input data, which are standard data loading operations. No data is transmitted externally or stored maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'file_obj' flows into pandas' data reading functions based on inferred or specified 'file_type'. There are no further flows outside data loading functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation detected. The filename-based type inference is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard imports and defines a function for data loading. It includes logic to infer file type from filename if not explicitly provided. It raises errors for unsupported types. The use of pandas functions for data loading is normal. No external network calls, code injections, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code operates within expected parameters for data ingestion.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for loading data from files into pandas DataFrames. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It performs standard file type inference and data reading functions.",
