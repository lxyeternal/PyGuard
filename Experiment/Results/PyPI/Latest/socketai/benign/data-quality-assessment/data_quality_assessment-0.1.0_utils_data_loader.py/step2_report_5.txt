  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**1. Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The report states the code loads data safely, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. It emphasizes standard pandas functions and filename-based inference.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** This aligns well with the code. No issues detected.\n\n**2. Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it highlights standard data loading with pandas, noting potential data trust issues but no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) perhaps due to the fact that untrusted files are processed without validation. This is a typical concern but not inherently malicious. The score seems reasonable.\n\n**3. Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates standard pandas data loading, no malicious activity, no code execution or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n**4. Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: standard data loading, no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.1) due to filename inference, but still reasonable.\n\n**5. Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Similar, emphasizing safe pandas usage, no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and safe.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.\n- The only minor concern is the reliance on filename extension for type inference, which is common but can be unreliable if filenames are manipulated. This is reflected in the small risk scores (~0.1-0.2).\n\n### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign malware=0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions, execute code, or handle untrusted data in a dangerous way.\n\n### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign obfuscated=0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n### Overall Risk:\n- The risk scores are low, which aligns with the analysis. The slight increases (0.1-0.2) are justified by the filename-based inference, but do not indicate significant security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is a typical data loader.\n- **Malware risk:** 0, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0, code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (~0.1-0.2), mainly due to filename inference, which is a known limitation but not a security flaw.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to filename inference, but overall very safe)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and does not pose security risks or contain malware. The minor risk associated with filename inference is acceptable and common in such utility functions.",
