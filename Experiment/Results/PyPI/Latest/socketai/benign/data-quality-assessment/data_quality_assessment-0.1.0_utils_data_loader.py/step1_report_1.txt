{
  "purpose": "The function loads data from files in various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON) into a pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "Reads input via 'file_obj' parameter, which can be a file object or a filename string. It uses 'hasattr' to check for 'filename' attribute and the 'pd.read_*' functions to load data.",
  "sinks": "Data loading functions such as 'pd.read_csv', 'pd.read_excel', 'pd.read_json' process the input data. No explicit unsafe data sinks like network transmission or file writing are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'file_obj' is checked for filename attribute; inferred file type is used to determine which pandas read function to invoke; data flows from input source to DataFrame return.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are evident. The code infers file type based on filename extension, which is common. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to infer the file type from the filename attribute if 'file_type' is not provided, then loads the data accordingly. Use of pandas I/O functions is standard and safe. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors observed. It’s a typical data loading utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward data loading operations without any malicious or suspicious activity. It relies on standard pandas functions and simple filename-based inference. No security risks identified.",
