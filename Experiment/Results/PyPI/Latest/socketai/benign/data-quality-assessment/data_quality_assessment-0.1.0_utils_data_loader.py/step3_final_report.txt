  "purpose": "Load data from files (CSV, Excel, JSON) into pandas DataFrame, inferring file type from filename if not specified.",
  "sources": "Filename attribute (hasattr(file_obj, 'filename')) for extension inference; file_obj passed to pandas read functions.",
  "sinks": "pandas.read_csv, pandas.read_excel, pandas.read_json functions operating on file_obj or filename.",
  "flows": "Filename extension inference → pandas read functions processing file_obj → DataFrame output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of filename extension for type inference; no validation of file content or filename integrity; no malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard pandas functions to load data, with filename extension inference as a common but potentially unreliable method. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is straightforward, with exception handling for unsupported types. The filename inference could be manipulated if untrusted filenames are processed, but this is a typical pattern and not inherently malicious. No network activity, code injection, or data leakage is observed. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to reliance on filename extension, which is a known and accepted limitation in such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data loader utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
