{
  "purpose": "The function loads data from various file formats into a pandas DataFrame based on the provided file object or filename.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'file_obj' parameter, which can be a file object or a filename string. It checks for attributes like 'filename' and reads data accordingly.",
  "sinks": "The data read functions (pd.read_csv, pd.read_excel, pd.read_json) are used to load data. These can be vulnerable if the input file is maliciously crafted, but the code itself does not execute or evaluate untrusted content.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'file_obj' into pandas read functions, which parse and load data into DataFrame objects. No further processing or data transmission occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code attempts to infer file type based on filename attributes, which is standard but may not be reliable; no suspicious or malicious code behavior is apparent. The code raises exceptions for unknown file types, which is expected behavior.",
  "analysis": "The function performs standard file type inference and data loading operations. It does not execute or evaluate file content beyond parsing it via pandas, which is safe. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. The use of pandas to load files is common and not malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data loading utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
