  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a straightforward utility to load data from CSV, Excel, or JSON files into pandas DataFrames.\n   - It infers file type from filename extension if `file_type` is not explicitly provided.\n   - Uses standard pandas functions (`pd.read_csv`, `pd.read_excel`, `pd.read_json`) with no additional processing.\n\n2. **Security Concerns & Anomalies**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n   - No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic.\n   - No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n   - Filename extension inference is standard but can be unreliable if filename is manipulated, though this is a common practice and not inherently malicious.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is standard, safe, and performs typical data loading operations.\n   - No suspicious patterns or malicious intent detected.\n   - Slight variations in confidence levels (mostly high, around 0.9 to 1).\n   - Security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1 to 0.2), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Scores Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score**: Slightly above zero (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern mainly due to filename-based inference, which is standard but can be manipulated if untrusted sources are involved.\n\n5. **Potential Issues & Assumptions**:\n   - The only minor concern is the reliance on filename extension for type inference, which could be exploited if untrusted files are processed. However, this is a common and accepted practice, not a security flaw per se.\n   - No evidence of vulnerabilities such as code injection, command execution, or malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n   - No malicious or obfuscated activity detected.\n   - The current scores are reasonable.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware**: Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated**: Keep at 0.\n- **Risk**: Slightly increase if considering untrusted input processing, but given the context, 0.1-0.2 is appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 (since filename inference could be manipulated, but no actual vulnerability exists)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a typical, safe data loader with no malicious activity. The scores are aligned with the analysis, and no significant security risks are present.",
