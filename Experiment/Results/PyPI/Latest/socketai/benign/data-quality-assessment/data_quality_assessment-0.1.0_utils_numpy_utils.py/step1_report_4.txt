  "purpose": "Utility function to recursively convert NumPy data types to native Python types for JSON serialization.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'obj' which can be any data structure containing NumPy types.",
  "sinks": "Return statements converting NumPy types; no external or untrusted data output.",
  "flows": "Input 'obj' passes through recursive checks, converting NumPy types to Python built-ins.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a recursive function to convert NumPy data types into native Python types, primarily for JSON serialization. It handles various NumPy integer, floating, boolean, and array types, converting them into standard Python int, float, bool, and list types respectively. There are no external data inputs, no network communications, no code injections, or suspicious logic. The function is straightforward and focused solely on data type conversion without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for data serialization. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation appears safe, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
