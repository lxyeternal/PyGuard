  "purpose": "Utility function to convert NumPy types to native Python types for JSON serialization",
  "sources": "Function parameter 'obj', which receives input data to process",
  "sinks": "The return statements output converted data; no external sink or untrusted data output observed",
  "flows": "Input 'obj' flows through recursive type checks and conversions, returning a Python-native structure",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected; function appears straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single utility function that recursively converts various NumPy data types into native Python types. It handles dictionaries, lists, NumPy integers, floating-point numbers, arrays, and booleans. The implementation uses type checks and recursive calls, with conversion functions like 'int()', 'float()', and 'tolist()'. The function's purpose is typical for JSON serialization tasks, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious data flow. There are no external data sources or sinks, and the code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility function for data conversion, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It poses no security risks and is unlikely to be part of a supply chain attack.",
