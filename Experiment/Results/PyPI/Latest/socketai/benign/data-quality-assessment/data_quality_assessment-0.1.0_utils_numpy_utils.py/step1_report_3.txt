{
  "purpose": "The function converts NumPy data types to native Python types to facilitate JSON serialization.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'obj' which can be any data structure containing NumPy types.",
  "sinks": "Return value of the function after conversion; no external sinks or data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the function, where it is recursively converted from NumPy types to Python types, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a recursive utility function designed to handle various NumPy data types and convert them into standard Python types for compatibility with JSON serialization. It handles dictionaries, lists, and specific NumPy types like integers, floats, booleans, and arrays. The implementation is standard and does not include any malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function with no signs of malicious intent. It performs a common data conversion task without any harmful behavior or security risks.",
