  "purpose": "Recursively convert NumPy types to native Python types for JSON serialization",
  "sources": "Input objects of various types, including dict, list, np.ndarray, np.integer, np.floating, np.bool_",
  "sinks": "Return converted Python-native types; no external sinks or data leaks",
  "flows": "Input objects -> type checks -> recursive conversions -> output of native Python types",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type conversions, no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard recursive conversion of NumPy data types to Python types, handling dicts, lists, arrays, and scalar types. It uses isinstance checks and recursion without side effects or external calls. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present, and the implementation is clear and correct.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for data serialization with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk 0. The code poses no threat and is safe for use.",
