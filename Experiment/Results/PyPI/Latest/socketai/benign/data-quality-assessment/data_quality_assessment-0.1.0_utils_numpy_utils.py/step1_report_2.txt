  "purpose": "Convert NumPy data types to native Python types for JSON serialization.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading beyond function parameters).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or external system interaction).",
  "flows": "Input data (obj) -> recursive type conversions -> output data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The function performs type checking and recursive conversion of NumPy types to native Python types. It handles dictionaries, lists, NumPy integers, floats, arrays, and booleans, converting them to Python-native types suitable for JSON serialization. The code uses standard library functions and NumPy's type system without any external or suspicious calls. No input validation or external data fetching occurs. There are no obfuscated patterns, malicious code, or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility function designed to facilitate JSON serialization of NumPy objects. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
