{
  "purpose": "The function recursively converts NumPy data types to native Python types for JSON serialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the 'obj' parameter passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The function returns converted data but does not write to external systems or perform I/O beyond data conversion.",
  "flows": "Input 'obj' flows through type checks and recursive calls, ultimately producing a JSON-serializable structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward data type conversion.",
  "analysis": "The code imports NumPy and defines a function that handles various NumPy data types, converting them into native Python types for serialization. It uses isinstance checks to identify the data types, performs recursive calls for collections, and properly converts numpy integers, floats, booleans, and arrays. No suspicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The function performs a benign task related to data formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for data type conversion without any malicious intent. It does not perform any malicious actions or security risks.",
