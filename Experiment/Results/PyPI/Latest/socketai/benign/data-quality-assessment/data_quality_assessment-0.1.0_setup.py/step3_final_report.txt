  "purpose": "Package setup configuration for the data-quality-assessment project, defining metadata, dependencies, entry points, and URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; uses explicit dependencies; references 'app:main' as entry point.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no code execution, no network activity, no secrets embedded.",
  "flows": "Setup script loads static data (README.md), specifies dependencies, and registers entry points without executing code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic execution; the 'app:main' reference is not executed here, only referenced.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard, straightforward setup.py with explicit dependencies and metadata. It does not perform any dynamic operations, handle untrusted input, or contain obfuscated code. The only potential concern is the 'app:main' entry point, which could execute code, but this cannot be assessed from setup.py alone. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious code. The minimal security risk score (0) is appropriate; the slight elevation in report 5 (0.1) is cautious but justified given the reference to an application entry point, which is outside the scope of this script. Overall, the package appears safe and trustworthy.",
