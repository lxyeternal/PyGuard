  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'data-quality-assessment' including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description; reading input dependencies; reading code for package setup and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted input data or perform operations that could leak or maliciously affect the system.",
  "flows": "No data flows indicating untrusted data from sources to sinks, as this is primarily a static setup script.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The dependencies are standard, and no malicious URLs or code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup using setuptools, specifying metadata, dependencies, entry points, and URLs. It reads the long description from a local README.md file and declares dependencies explicitly. All dependencies are pinned to specific versions, which is good practice. The URLs and contact information appear legitimate. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The script is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. It solely defines package metadata and configuration, with no data handling or code execution beyond setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious activity. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks. The dependencies and URLs are legitimate, and there are no anomalies indicative of security issues.",
