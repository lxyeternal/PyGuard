{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'data-quality-assessment' Python project, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, importing setuptools functions, package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data handling that could lead to security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - setup configuration without data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script utilizes standard setuptools for packaging Python code, specifying project metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It reads the README file for description, which is common practice. The dependencies are explicitly listed with fixed versions, reducing risks of supply chain issues. The code structure follows typical setup.py conventions without any dynamic or malicious code segments. No input/output, network operations, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to standard practices for Python packaging.",
