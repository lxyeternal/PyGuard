{
  "purpose": "This script configures the packaging and distribution of a Python web application for data quality assessment.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools, and defining package dependencies, entry points, and project URLs.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no code writes untrusted data or performs unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script primarily sets metadata and dependencies without data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code strictly follows standard setup.py conventions without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It imports necessary functions from setuptools, reads the long description from a file, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network operations are present. The dependencies are explicitly listed with fixed versions, and no environment variables or secrets are used. The script contains no obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
