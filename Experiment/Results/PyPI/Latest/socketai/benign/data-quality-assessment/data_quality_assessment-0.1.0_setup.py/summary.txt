  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious code. The minimal security risk score (0) is appropriate; the slight elevation in report 5 (0.1) is cautious but justified given the reference to an application entry point, which is outside the scope of this script. Overall, the package appears safe and trustworthy."
