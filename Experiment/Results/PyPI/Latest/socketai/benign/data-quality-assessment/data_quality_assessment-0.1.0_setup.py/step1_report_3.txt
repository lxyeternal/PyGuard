{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'data-quality-assessment' Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for long description, and uses 'find_packages()' to identify package contents. It also specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially malicious operations or external communications.",
  "flows": "The code reads a local README file during setup; dependencies are listed but not executed or fetched during runtime in this script.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The setup script is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration using setuptools. It imports setup and find_packages, specifies project metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It reads a local README file to populate long description, which is common. No dynamic code execution, network access, or other suspicious activity is evident. The dependencies are fixed versions, reducing risks of supply chain tampering. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The code adheres to standard packaging practices, with no anomalies or irregularities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Overall, it appears safe and trustworthy.",
