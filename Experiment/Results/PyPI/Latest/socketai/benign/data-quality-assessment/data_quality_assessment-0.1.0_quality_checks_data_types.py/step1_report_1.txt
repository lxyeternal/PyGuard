{
  "purpose": "The code analyzes data types and potential mismatches in a pandas DataFrame, including sampling data and identifying possible date or numeric string columns.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the DataFrame's columns via dropna(), sample(), and shape attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data elsewhere; it only processes and samples data internally.",
  "flows": "Data is sampled from DataFrame columns, then pattern matching and type inference are performed based on sampled data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The sampling functions are cautious, avoiding exceptions. The code performs pattern matching for date and numeric strings but does not perform any harmful actions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data type analysis on pandas DataFrame columns, sampling data carefully to avoid errors with empty columns or all-missing data. It uses regular expressions to detect date-like patterns and attempts to identify numeric strings within object-type columns. All data processing occurs internally with no external network, file, or system calls. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The functions include safety checks such as handling empty columns and avoiding exceptions during sampling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data analysis utility that inspects pandas DataFrame columns for type mismatches and potential data issues. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks present in this code snippet.",
