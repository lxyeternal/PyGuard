{
  "purpose": "The code analyzes data types in a pandas DataFrame, detects potential mismatches, and suggests conversions such as to datetime or numeric types.",
  "sources": "DataFrame columns, particularly during sampling and pattern matching on object-type columns.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no data is written to external sources or output that could leak sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Data flows from DataFrame columns into sampling functions, then into regex pattern matching and type inference logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Sampling functions include safety checks but are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data inspection by sampling DataFrame columns, checking for date-like patterns and numeric strings in object types. The sampling functions include safeguards against sampling more data than available, indicating attention to robustness. There are no network calls, eval statements, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The regex patterns for date detection are standard. No malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms are evident; the code is typical data analysis logic with safety checks. The code does not read external inputs besides the DataFrame, nor does it write external data or perform dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data analysis utility with safety checks and pattern matching for data type inference. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, benign code intended for data quality checks.",
