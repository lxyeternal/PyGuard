{
  "purpose": "The code analyzes a pandas DataFrame to identify data types and potential mismatches, such as date or numeric patterns in object columns.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the pandas DataFrame columns via dropna() and sample() methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems or perform insecure operations. It generates summaries and issue reports internally.",
  "flows": "Data is sampled from DataFrame columns, analyzed with regex and type conversions, and results are compiled into dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, network access, or unusual code behavior observed. Sampling functions handle missing data carefully. No obfuscated or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data inspection routines: sampling data safely, detecting date-like patterns with regex, and checking for numeric strings in object columns. It includes defensive checks for empty or all-missing columns and avoids exceptions during sampling. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are evident. The logic appears standard for data validation and type inference.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data analysis utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed to analyze data types and suggest conversions. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are detected.",
