  "purpose": "Generate a comprehensive data quality report including summary statistics, missing values, outliers, data types, issues, duplicates, and visualizations.",
  "sources": "DataFrame input, missing_summary, outliers_data, type_summary, type_issues, duplicate_data, utils.numpy_utils.convert_numpy_types",
  "sinks": "HTML visualizations (plotly), report dictionary output",
  "flows": "DataFrame processed through analysis functions, visualizations generated as HTML, report assembled and converted types",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or external network activity; use of external utility 'convert_numpy_types' assumed safe",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data analysis tasks: generating summary stats, plotting missing data and outliers, compiling report data, and converting numpy types. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected. External utility 'convert_numpy_types' is presumed safe. Visualizations are generated locally and returned as HTML snippets. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical data reporting modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard data analysis and visualization without malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate but could be conservatively lowered to zero for risk, given the lack of actual threats.",
