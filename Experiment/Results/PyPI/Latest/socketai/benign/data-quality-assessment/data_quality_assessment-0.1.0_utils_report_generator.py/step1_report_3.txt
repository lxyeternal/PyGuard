{
  "purpose": "This code generates data quality reports and visualizations for a pandas DataFrame, including summary statistics, missing values, outliers, and data types.",
  "sources": "Imports external libraries and the 'convert_numpy_types' function; reads data from the input DataFrame 'df' and other parameters.",
  "sinks": "Returns a JSON report with visualizations as HTML snippets, and converts NumPy types to Python types at the end.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrame and related summaries to visualization functions; visualizations are embedded into the report; final report is generated and converted to standard Python types.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The code mainly performs data processing and visualization tasks without external network access or system modification. Usage of 'convert_numpy_types' might be examined further, but likely safe if it's a standard utility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for generating data quality metrics and visualizations, then compiles a comprehensive report. All functions use standard libraries (pandas, plotly) and standard data processing techniques. No evidence of obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or suspicious behavior. The only external function call, 'convert_numpy_types', appears to be a utility for type conversion, not malicious. There are no data exfiltration, network access, or privilege escalation mechanisms evident. The code strictly handles data analysis and visualization without side effects or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data reporting utility with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It processes input data, generates visualizations, and produces a report, all in a standard manner. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
