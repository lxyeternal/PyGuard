  "purpose": "This code generates various data quality reports and visualizations for a pandas DataFrame, including summary statistics, missing values, outliers, and data types.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a pandas DataFrame ('df'), missing_summary, outliers_data, type_summary, type_issues, and duplicate_data. Uses imported functions and libraries for data processing and visualization.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include HTML strings for Plotly figures, a dictionary report, and data returned after converting NumPy types; no direct data leaks or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrame and auxiliary data into visualization functions and the final report generation, with no external network or system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as dynamic execution, hidden code, or code injection mechanisms. All functions perform standard data processing and visualization tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common data analysis libraries, defines functions for generating statistical summaries and visualizations, and constructs a report dictionary. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. The conversion of NumPy types suggests handling of NumPy arrays but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall structure and functions are typical for data analysis workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data quality reporting tool without any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It solely processes and visualizes data within the application context. No signs of malware or security threats are detected.",
