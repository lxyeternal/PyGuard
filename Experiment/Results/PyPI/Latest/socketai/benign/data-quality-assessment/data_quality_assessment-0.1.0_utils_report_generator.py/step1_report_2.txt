{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to analyze a pandas DataFrame, generate statistical summaries, visualizations for missing data and outliers, and compile a comprehensive report including data types, duplicates, and issues.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard and third-party libraries (pandas, json, plotly, io, base64, utils.numpy_utils); data input via function parameters (df, missing_summary, outliers_data, etc.)",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable parts are the HTML outputs from Plotly visualizations and the final report returned after converting numpy types; no direct data sinks or external data writes are present",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrame and summary objects into visualization functions, then into the report generator, which serializes the output into JSON-compatible structures",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns or anomalies observed; code uses standard libraries and straightforward data processing logic; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data analysis tasks: computing summary statistics, creating visualizations for missing values and outliers, and compiling a report. The use of plotly for generating HTML visualizations is standard. The function convert_numpy_types is applied at the end, but its source is from a utils module, which appears to be a custom utility; without further info, it does not indicate malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or system modifications are present. The overall structure and implementation are typical of data reporting scripts, with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data analysis and reporting utility with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It processes data, generates visualizations, and outputs structured reports securely. The reliance on external libraries and functions appears benign.",
