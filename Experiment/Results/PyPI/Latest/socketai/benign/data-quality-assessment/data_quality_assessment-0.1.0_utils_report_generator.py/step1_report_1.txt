{
  "purpose": "This code generates data quality reports for a pandas DataFrame, including summary statistics, missing values, outliers, and visualizations.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (pandas, json, plotly, io, base64) and a utility function 'convert_numpy_types' from an external module 'utils.numpy_utils'.",
  "sinks": "Uses plotly for visualization rendering and the 'convert_numpy_types' function for data processing; no data is written to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrame through various analysis functions to generate statistical summaries, visualizations, and final report output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic detected. The code appears to be straightforward data analysis and visualization code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard data analysis tasks: calculating summary stats, creating bar plots for missing data and outliers, and assembling a comprehensive report. It imports common libraries without suspicious modules or obfuscated code. There are no indications of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious operations. The use of 'convert_numpy_types' is benign, assuming it safely converts NumPy data types. Overall, the code is consistent with typical data processing workflows, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data analysis and reporting module with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It strictly performs data summarization and visualization tasks without any suspicious operations.",
