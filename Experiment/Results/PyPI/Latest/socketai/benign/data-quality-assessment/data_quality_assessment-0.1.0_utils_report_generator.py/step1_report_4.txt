{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for generating data quality reports, including summary statistics, missing values visualization, outlier detection, and combined report creation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from pandas DataFrames (e.g., df, missing_summary, outliers_data, type_summary, type_issues, duplicate_data). It also imports functions from external modules (utils.numpy_utils).",
  "sinks": "The code converts plots to HTML strings via plotly's to_html, and calls convert_numpy_types to process data, which may manipulate data types. No network or sensitive data access occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrames into functions for analysis and visualization, with outputs being HTML visualizations and a report dictionary; the convert_numpy_types function processes the report data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No network calls, file operations, or environment variable usage detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data analysis and visualization tasks using well-known libraries (pandas, plotly). It converts data types and generates HTML visualizations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external network communication, or data exfiltration. The use of external utility functions appears legitimate. Overall, the code seems to serve a legitimate purpose with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data analysis/reporting script that generates visualizations and summaries for data quality assessment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
