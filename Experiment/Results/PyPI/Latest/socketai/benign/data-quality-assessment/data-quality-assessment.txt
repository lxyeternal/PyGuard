      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious code. The minimal security risk score (0) is appropriate; the slight elevation in report 5 (0.1) is cautious but justified given the reference to an application entry point, which is outside the scope of this script. Overall, the package appears safe and trustworthy."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or behavior. It functions as a standard data validation routine. The highest risk score assigned in the critical reports (1) is unjustified; a score of 0.0 is appropriate. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero. The overall security risk is negligible, estimated at 0.0 to 0.1, primarily due to cautious sampling considerations. Therefore, the final assessment is that the code is safe, non-malicious, and suitable for use."
