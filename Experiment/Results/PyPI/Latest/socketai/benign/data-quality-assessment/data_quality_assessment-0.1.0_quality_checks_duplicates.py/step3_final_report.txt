  "purpose": "Detect duplicate rows and column-wise duplicate values in a pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "DataFrame input parameter 'df' for duplication checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code performs in-memory analysis only.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> duplicated() checks -> result dictionary with counts and examples.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pandas, defines a function to identify full duplicates and column duplicates, counts them, and returns a summary. It uses pandas' duplicated() method for detection, compiles counts and examples, and calculates percentages. The logic is correct, and there are no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The code is simple, clear, and performs a standard data analysis task without external interactions or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and performs duplicate detection in pandas DataFrames. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The empty reports do not indicate any issues. Overall, the code is safe, and the security risk is minimal.",
