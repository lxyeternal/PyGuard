  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for general utility or data processing, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, file reads, network requests, or any external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Output functions, system commands, file writes, network communications, or sensitive data handling points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, potentially passing untrusted data unvalidated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code was carefully reviewed for common security issues, including malicious payloads, backdoors, or data leaks. No suspicious patterns, such as code injection, insecure data handling, or malicious network activity, were identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard, and no obfuscated segments were found. The overall structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious tampering or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve legitimate purposes without any signs of sabotage or malware. However, a more comprehensive review of all dependencies and runtime behavior could further ensure security.",
