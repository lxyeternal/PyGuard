  "purpose": "Assessment of supply chain security for the open source dependency based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Reported suspicious patterns such as eval()/exec(), hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, external calls, network activity, and code structure.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, malicious external calls, code execution points, hardcoded credentials, and obfuscation techniques.",
  "flows": "Sources of suspicious patterns (eval(), hardcoded secrets) leading to malicious actions or obfuscation indicators.",
  "anomalies": "High suspicion of obfuscation (score 0.6), dynamic code execution, and hardcoded secrets in Report 1; absence of such in others.",
  "analysis": "Reports 2-5 show no evidence of malicious activity, with scores appropriately low (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2). Report 1 indicates suspicious patterns but lacks concrete code snippets for confirmation; scores of malware 0.4 and obfuscated 0.6 are justified if patterns are present, but should be moderated if unverified. Based on the descriptions, a more cautious approach suggests lowering Report 1's malware to 0.2 and obfuscated to 0.4, with a risk score around 0.5. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the evidence, with the exception of overestimated suspicion in Report 1.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign; suspicion in Report 1 is justified but unconfirmed. Adjusted scores better reflect the evidence, with moderate concern for Report 1 and low risk for others.",
