{
  "purpose": "The code is an empty or whitespace-only file, serving as a placeholder or incomplete artifact, with no executable code or data.",
  "sources": "No data sources or input points; the file contains only whitespace or is empty.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; absence of code prevents any data processing or leakage.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink paths exist due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "The file is entirely empty or contains only whitespace, which is unusual for active code but common for placeholders or corrupted files.",
  "analysis": "All reports confirm the absence of executable code, variables, or data flows. They correctly identify that no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks can be assessed without actual code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the evidence. The reports are cautious and appropriate, noting the suspicious nature of empty files but not overestimating threats. Given the total lack of code, no security concerns are present, and the assessments are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The file contains no code and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate and consistent, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious activity or obfuscation. No adjustments are necessary; the scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
