  "conclusion": "The provided reports are generally consistent with their analyses. Report 3's suspicion warrants a marginal increase in malware score to 0.5. Other reports' scores are appropriate. Overall, the dependency shows moderate supply chain risk mainly due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution patterns, warranting cautious monitoring."
