  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific data processing or automation task, but without seeing the actual code, it is unclear what the exact intent is.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly visible without the code, but typically include environment variables, file reads, network requests, or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be system commands, network connections, or file writes where untrusted data might be exploited or leak.",
  "flows": "Without the specific code, it is not possible to trace source-to-sink flows accurately.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without inspecting the code content, but common concerns include hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of the code snippet, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Key areas to review would include input handling, data validation, use of external libraries, network communication, and any dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to determine malicious intent or security risks. No specific issues can be identified without examining the actual code. Recommend providing the code for a thorough review.",
