{
  "purpose": "Translate text detection using Google Translate API wrapper to identify language of input text.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameter 'text' and instantiates the Translator object.",
  "sinks": "The 'detect' method of the Translator object may send data over the network to Google Translate servers.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is passed to 'translator.detect', which communicates with external servers; the result's 'lang' is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code uses a standard library call.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'googletrans' library and defines a function that creates a Translator instance. It calls 'detect' to identify the language of the input text and returns the detected language code. This involves network communication with Google Translate's servers. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. The code is straightforward and uses public API functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple language detection function using an open-source library with external network access. No malicious intent or suspicious activity detected. It performs expected API calls for language detection.",
