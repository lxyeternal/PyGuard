{
  "purpose": "Translate and detect the language of input text using Google Translate API",
  "sources": "Reading input parameter 'text' in the detect() function",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not output data or send it elsewhere",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows into 'translator.detect(text)', which returns the language code",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of third-party library 'googletrans' is standard for translation tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Translator class from 'googletrans', instantiates it within the detect() function, and calls its detect() method on the input text. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated code. The functionality appears to be straightforward language detection. No external data exfiltration, network communication beyond the library call, or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple language detection implementation using a standard open-source library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
