  "purpose": "The code defines a function to detect the language of a given text using the googletrans library.",
  "sources": "Input text provided to the detect function.",
  "sinks": "The function returns the language code; no data leaks or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input text -> Translator.detect() method -> returns language code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the googletrans.Translator class, creates an instance within the function, and uses it to detect the language of the provided text. The library is a legitimate open-source translation library that communicates with Google Translate API, but it does not store or leak data inherently. The function is straightforward, with no obfuscated code or malicious constructs. No external data or network calls are visible outside the library's internal implementation. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard language detection task using an open-source library with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility function.",
