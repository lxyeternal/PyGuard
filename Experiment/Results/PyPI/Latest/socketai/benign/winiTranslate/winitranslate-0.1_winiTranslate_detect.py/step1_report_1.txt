{
  "purpose": "The code detects the language of a given text using the googletrans Translator API.",
  "sources": "Input text provided to the detect() function.",
  "flows": "Input text -> Translator.detect() method -> Returns language code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or external data transmission observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the googletrans Translator, defines a detect function that initializes a Translator instance, calls its detect method with the input text, and returns the detected language. The use of a third-party library for language detection is standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unsafe code execution. The code is straightforward and limited to language detection functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign language detection operation using a common open-source library. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
