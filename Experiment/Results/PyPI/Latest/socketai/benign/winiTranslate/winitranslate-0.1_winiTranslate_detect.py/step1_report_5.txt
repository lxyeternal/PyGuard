{
  "purpose": "The code detects the language of a given text using the googletrans library.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' received by the 'detect' function",
  "sinks": "The 'translator.detect' method which processes the input text to identify language",
  "flows": "Input 'text' -> 'translator.detect(text)' -> returns detected language",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code detected; the code appears straightforward and intended for language detection",
  "analysis": "The code imports a translation library, defines a function that creates a Translator object, and uses it to detect the language of input text. The library 'googletrans' is a third-party package for language translation and detection, which is generally not malicious. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident. The code does not perform network communications directly; the library handles network calls internally. No obfuscation, unusual code constructs, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard language detection using an external library without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
