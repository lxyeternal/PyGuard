  "purpose": "Provides a function to return the list of language codes and names from the googletrans library.",
  "sources": "Imports LANGUAGES from the googletrans library",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted input or output data",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the function simply returns a static data structure",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of an external library constant",
  "analysis": "The code imports LANGUAGES from googletrans and defines a function 'list' that returns this constant. There is no input processing, data manipulation, or output beyond returning the imported constant. The code appears to be a simple utility function with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not exhibit any malicious or security-risk behavior. It simply exposes the LANGUAGES constant from googletrans.",
