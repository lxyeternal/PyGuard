  "purpose": "Provides a function that returns the LANGUAGES dictionary from the googletrans library.",
  "sources": "Imports LANGUAGES from googletrans; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "Returns a constant; no data sinks or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data exposure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known constant from a third-party library and exposes it via a function. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or contain any logic that could be malicious. The function name 'list' shadows a built-in but does not introduce security issues. All signals indicate benign behavior with no obfuscation or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility exposing a constant from a third-party library. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
