{
  "purpose": "The code imports language data from the 'googletrans' library and provides a function to list supported languages.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'googletrans' library import statement.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input sources to sinks; the function simply returns a static dataset.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a publicly available library component and defines a function that returns a static attribute. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The usage is standard and does not invoke any untrusted sources or perform unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, only providing access to language data from the 'googletrans' library without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
