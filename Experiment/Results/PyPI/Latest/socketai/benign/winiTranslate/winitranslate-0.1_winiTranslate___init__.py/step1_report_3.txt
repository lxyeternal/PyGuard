  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions from local modules within a package, likely for translation, detection, and listing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .translate, .detect, and .list",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; no external data handling or outputs are shown in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this minimal code snippet; it only imports functions without executing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing functions from local modules within the same package. There are no data inputs, no external network calls, or sensitive operations demonstrated. The structure appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard module imports with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security issues detected. It is a typical setup for a Python package.",
