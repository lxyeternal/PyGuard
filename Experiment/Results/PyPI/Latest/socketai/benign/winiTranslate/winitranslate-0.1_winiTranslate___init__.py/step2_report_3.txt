  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring rationale.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom .translate import translate\nfrom .detect import detect\nfrom .list import list\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Imports three functions/modules related to language processing.\n- **Findings:** No issues; straightforward imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully accurate. The code is benign. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, related to language processing.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no untrusted data, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Analysis:** The report assigns a small security risk (0.1). Given that the code is just import statements, this is likely overestimating. Since no data handling or external calls are involved, the security risk should be 0. **Recommendation:** Reduce `securityRisk` to 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, straightforward imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring consistency:\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- The only discrepancy is in Report 2, where `securityRisk` is set to 0.1 despite no evidence of risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final malware, obfuscated, and risk score estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk present in the code snippet)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is purely import statements with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n- The minor security risk in Report 2 appears unjustified and should be lowered to 0.\n- All reports correctly assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0.\n\n---\n\n## **Final recommendations:**\n- **Adjust Report 2's `securityRisk` to 0.**  \n- **Maintain all other scores at 0 for malware and obfuscated.**  \n- **Overall risk score:** 0, malware score: 0, obfuscated score: 0.\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign nature and the analysis provided.",
