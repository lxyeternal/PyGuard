  "purpose": "This code imports functions translate, detect, and list from local modules within the package, likely related to language processing or similar functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .translate, .detect, and .list",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident in the provided snippet; imports are static and do not process data",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with straightforward imports; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple set of import statements from relative modules within a package. It does not include any dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. The structure suggests typical modular design. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent. The code appears to be part of a larger project, but this snippet alone shows no signs of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. The code performs standard import operations from local modules, which is common and safe.",
