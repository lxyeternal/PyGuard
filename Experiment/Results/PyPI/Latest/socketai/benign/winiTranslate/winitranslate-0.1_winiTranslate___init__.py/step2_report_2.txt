  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the scores, logic, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as simple import statements from local modules, with no malicious activity or security issues.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully accurate; no issues.  \n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Also correctly states that these are straightforward relative imports with no data handling or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1, obfuscated 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 might be slightly high given the absence of any suspicious activity. It might be more appropriate to set it to 0, considering the code's benign nature.  \n- **Recommendation:** Reduce `securityRisk` to 0 for consistency.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, it notes standard import statements with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Correctly states that these are typical relative imports with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Recognizes the code as benign import statements, with no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0, with one at 0.1. Given the absence of any suspicious or malicious activity, a risk score of 0 is more appropriate across the board.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code only performs import statements from local modules.  \n- No data flows, external network activity, or suspicious patterns are present.  \n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.  \n- The minimal code snippet is typical for Python projects.\n\n### **My Overall Estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** All reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The only minor adjustment is lowering the `securityRisk` score in Report 2 from 0.1 to 0, to reflect the actual low-risk profile.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \n- The scores are appropriate; no further suspicion or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.  \n- The assessment confirms that the code is standard, safe, and free from malicious intent.",
