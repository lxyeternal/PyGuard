  "purpose": "Import statements for local modules related to translation, detection, and listing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Relative import statements from local modules: .translate, .detect, .list",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; code only performs imports",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static import statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward relative import statements from local modules. There is no data processing, network activity, or dynamic behavior. The modules have generic names typical for language processing tasks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The minimal structure and absence of external interactions indicate a benign setup code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The import statements are standard and do not introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware likelihood is zero.",
