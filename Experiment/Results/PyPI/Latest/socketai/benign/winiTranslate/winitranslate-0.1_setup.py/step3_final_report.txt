  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'winiTranslate', defining metadata, dependencies, and reading the README for description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or dynamic code execution",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, network calls, or obfuscated patterns. It reads static metadata and a local README file, which is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious imports, and no malicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with only a minor discrepancy in one report assigning a small security risk score of 0.1, which is unwarranted given the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The slight security risk score in one report should be adjusted to zero for consistency. Overall, the package is safe for use.",
