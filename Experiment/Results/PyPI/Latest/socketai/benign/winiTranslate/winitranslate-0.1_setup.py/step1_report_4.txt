  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python translation module with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads package information, dependencies, author details, and long description from files and hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; dependencies are specified explicitly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials (besides author info), or suspicious constructs detected. Uses standard setuptools setup process.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads metadata, dependencies, and description from standard sources. No code execution, external data processing, or suspicious behavior is present. The only external file read is 'README.md' for the long description, which is standard. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard setup script for a Python package. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
