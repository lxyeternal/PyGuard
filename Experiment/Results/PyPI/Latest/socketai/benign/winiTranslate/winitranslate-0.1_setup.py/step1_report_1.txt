  "sources": "Reads package information, dependencies, author details, and README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup script primarily reads static files and package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to package a Python project. It specifies dependencies, author info, description, and package discovery. It reads the README.md file for the long description. There are no dynamic or user-input elements, no network connections, and no code execution beyond standard package configuration. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present. All components are typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
