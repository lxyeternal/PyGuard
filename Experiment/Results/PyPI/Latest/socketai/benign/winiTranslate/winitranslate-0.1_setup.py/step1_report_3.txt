  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'winiTranslate' including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading package requirements, package discovery via find_packages(), reading README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows identified; setup process and package dependencies are standard.",
  "flows": "Reading long_description from file -> setup configuration; no untrusted data flow from external sources or inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. Usage of standard setuptools functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, importing setuptools, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and reading a README file. No obfuscated code, malicious imports, or suspicious behavior detected. The only external operation is reading 'README.md', which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
