  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python module. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code, network calls, or suspicious patterns. The confidence is high (1).  \n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, a standard setup script with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Justification:** No anomalies, no external data handling beyond reading a README file, which is typical.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical setup.py script.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Analysis of securityRisk:** The slight increase (0.1) seems to stem from reading external files, but this is standard and poses no real security risk.  \n- **Justification:** Reading a README.md file does not introduce security issues; it's standard practice.  \n- **Verdict:** The securityRisk score could be lowered to 0 for consistency, as no actual risk exists.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard setup script.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity, no external code execution or data handling beyond reading a local file.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Also a typical setup.py script.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious code, no obfuscated parts, just reading a README.md file.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly zero; the one at 0.1 in Report 3 could be lowered to 0, as reading a local README file is standard and safe.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Adjust Report 3's securityRisk from 0.1 to 0** for consistency.\n- **Overall malware and obfuscated scores:** Remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Estimated scores based on the code:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0 (since no real security risk is present)\n\nThis thorough review confirms that the setup scripts are benign and pose no security threats.",
