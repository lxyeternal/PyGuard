{
  "purpose": "Provides a translation function using the googletrans library, translating input text to a specified language.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' and the call to translator.translate() which contacts Google's translation API.",
  "sinks": "The translation API call potentially sends data over the network; no other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows into the translate() method, which contacts the external translation service, returning translated text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known translation library, creates a new Translator object on each call, and performs translation. It interacts with external services but does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or data leaks. The network communication is expected for translation functionality. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear. The security risk score is low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk due to network activity but no malicious activity. The scores across reports are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward translation utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and align with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
