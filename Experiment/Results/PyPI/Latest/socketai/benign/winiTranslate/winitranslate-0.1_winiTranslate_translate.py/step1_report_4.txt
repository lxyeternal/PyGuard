{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to translate input text into a specified target language using the googletrans library.",
  "sources": "The function reads input text via the 'text' parameter and creates a Translator instance internally.",
  "sinks": "The translated text is returned; no external or untrusted data is sent elsewhere in the code.",
  "flows": "Input text -> Translator.translate() -> output text",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. The code relies on an external library without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'googletrans' library and defines a translation function. It instantiates a Translator object each time the function is called and translates the provided text into the specified language. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network connections explicitly coded outside the library, and no suspicious behavior. The usage of 'googletrans' is standard for translation purposes, and the code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration or code injection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a translation function using an open-source library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It operates as intended for translation without malicious intent.",
