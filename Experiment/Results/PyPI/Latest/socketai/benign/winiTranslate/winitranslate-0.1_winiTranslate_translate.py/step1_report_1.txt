  "purpose": "The code provides a function to translate text into a specified target language using the googletrans library.",
  "sources": "The function reads input text 'text' passed as an argument to the translate() function.",
  "sinks": "The translation result 'result.text' is returned; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere or stored persistently.",
  "flows": "Input text is received, translated via the googletrans Translator object, and the translated text is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The googletrans library is used normally.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the googletrans Translator, defines a translate function that creates a Translator object, performs translation, and returns the result. No suspicious behavior such as network calls beyond expected translation, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks observed. The library is a standard open-source translation API client. The function seems straightforward and does not contain malicious code or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple translation utility using the googletrans library with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or data exfiltration.",
