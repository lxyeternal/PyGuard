{
  "purpose": "Translate input text into a specified target language using Google Translate API.",
  "sources": "The function reads input text passed as the 'text' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The code calls the 'translate' method of the Translator object, which sends data over the network to Google Translate servers.",
  "flows": "Input text (source) is passed to translator.translate, which communicates with external servers and returns translated text (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code are present. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'googletrans' library and defines a function to translate text. The translation involves creating a Translator object and calling its translate method, which performs a network request to Google's translation service. The code appears straightforward, with no indicators of malicious intent or suspicious data handling. The use of a third-party library for translation is common and does not imply malicious activity. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple translation utility using a common open-source library. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a network call to Google Translate to translate input text, which is standard functionality.",
