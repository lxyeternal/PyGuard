  "conclusion": "The setup process executes an internal script ('utilities.py') without validation, posing a significant supply chain security risk. While the script itself may be benign, this pattern allows for malicious tampering, making it a high-risk behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; I recommend treating this pattern with caution and implementing validation or alternative approaches to mitigate the risk."
