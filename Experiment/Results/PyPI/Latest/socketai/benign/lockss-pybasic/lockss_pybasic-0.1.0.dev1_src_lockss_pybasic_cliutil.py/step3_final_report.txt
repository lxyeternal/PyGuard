  "purpose": "Defines a class to store a version string and print it when invoked.",
  "sources": "The constructor parameter 'version' and the 'action' method which outputs to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "The print statement in 'action' outputs data to sys.stdout, which is standard for CLI output.",
  "flows": "The version string stored in '_version' flows directly to the print statement in 'action'.",
  "anomalies": "Inheritance from 'pydantic.v1.Field' is unconventional for a command class but not malicious; no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it stores a version string and prints it upon calling 'action'. It uses standard libraries without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external input processing. The inheritance from 'pydantic.v1.Field' is unusual but not malicious. No network activity, data leaks, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility component for printing a version string with no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
