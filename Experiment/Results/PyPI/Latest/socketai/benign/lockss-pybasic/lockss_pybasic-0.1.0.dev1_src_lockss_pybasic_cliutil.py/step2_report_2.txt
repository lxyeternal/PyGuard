  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of findings:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, defining a class to store and print a version string.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The use of 'pydantic.v1.Field' appears standard for data modeling.\n- The 'action' method simply prints the stored version to sys.stdout, which is typical for CLI tools.\n- No external input processing or dynamic code execution is present.\n\n**Review of scores:**\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n- Security risk scores are all 0, consistent with no identified vulnerabilities.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), reflecting the consensus that the code is safe.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate given the clarity of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- The reports are very consistent and do not raise any red flags.\n- The only minor point is the use of 'pydantic.v1.Field' in a class that does not seem to leverage pydantic's validation features. This might be unnecessary but is not malicious.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all assessments are reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- Obfuscated score: **0** (clear code)\n- Risk score: **0** (no security concerns)\n\n**Final note:**\nThe code appears to be a simple, well-structured utility component for displaying version info, with no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
