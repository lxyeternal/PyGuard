  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, consisting solely of static license and copyright comments/strings.\n- No input/output, data processing, or external communication is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code snippets are straightforward variable assignments with no dynamic or executable logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  All reports agree that there are no issues, malware, or obfuscation present. The code only contains metadata variables, which are benign.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Analysis correctness:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is purely static and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. No flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any risky behavior.\n\n### Risk score justification:\n- The risk score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign assessment.\n- No higher risk scores are warranted.\n\n### Malware score justification:\n- The malware score is 0, correctly reflecting no malicious activity.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- The code is static metadata; no assumptions or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the evidence, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard header with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the reports are correct and thorough.",
