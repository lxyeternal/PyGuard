{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a static header containing license, copyright, and version information, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only defines static string variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code contains only static strings.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments for license and version info, with no executable logic, data processing, or external communication. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code is benign and serves as a header or metadata fragment. Given the static nature and lack of dynamic or external interactions, there are no security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static header with no executable content, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. It poses no security risk and is appropriate as a license or metadata header.",
