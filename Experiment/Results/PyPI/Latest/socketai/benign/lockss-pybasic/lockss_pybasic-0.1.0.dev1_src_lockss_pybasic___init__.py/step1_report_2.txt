  "purpose": "Define copyright, license, and version information for the Python software",
  "sources": "Reading copyright, license, and version string definitions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static metadata definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of metadata variables (__copyright__, __license__, __version__) with static string content. The license string is a multi-line string. There are no input operations, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. No code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs. The structure is straightforward and typical for license headers.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard license and metadata header with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It contains no source-to-sink data flows, no anomalies, or malicious code segments.",
