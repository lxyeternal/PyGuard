  "purpose": "Define copyright, license, and version information for a Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading module-level string variables (__copyright__, __license__, __version__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only static string assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard license and copyright declaration without dynamic code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns static string literals to metadata variables (__copyright__, __license__, __version__). There are no input reads, no data processing, and no external or system interactions. The license and copyright strings are hardcoded but benign. No suspicious code structures, dynamic execution, or external communications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard header section for a Python package, containing metadata only. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks identified.",
