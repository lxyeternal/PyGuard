{
  "purpose": "The code defines copyright, license, and version information, likely serving as a header for a larger Python script or package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string data from variables (__copyright__, __license__, __version__). No external input or data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data, execute system commands, or handle sensitive information.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static strings to variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely informational with no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs. It contains standard licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains only metadata variables (__copyright__, __license__, __version__) with static string assignments. It does not include any input handling, output, or executable logic. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. It appears to be a benign header or metadata section for a larger program.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign header fragment containing licensing and version info, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
