{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the Python package 'pyprettifier' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the contents of 'README.md' from the current directory to set the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations are present that could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves reading 'README.md' and passing it to 'long_description' in setup(), with no further data processing or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present. The code uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' modules and 'Path' for file handling. It reads the 'README.md' file from the current directory to assign a long description. The setup() function specifies package metadata, dependencies ('requests'), and Python version requirements. All operations are standard for package setup, with no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation. There are no sources of untrusted input beyond local file reading, which is typical for package configuration. No network activity, code injection, or suspicious logic is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads local documentation and defines package metadata and dependencies. Therefore, it can be considered safe.",
