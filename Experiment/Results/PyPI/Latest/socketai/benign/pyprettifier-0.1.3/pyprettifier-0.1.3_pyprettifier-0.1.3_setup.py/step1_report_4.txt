{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'pyprettifier' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filename 'README.md' to obtain the long description; the 'install_requires' list specifies dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks that could lead to data leaks or code execution; no external data is processed in a way that affects system security.",
  "flows": "The code reads the README file for metadata, which is static, and specifies dependencies for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. Usage of standard setup procedures with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration using setuptools to prepare a Python package. It reads a local README file for the long description and specifies dependencies and package metadata. No untrusted input, no network activity, nor code execution is present. All functions are static and follow typical package setup conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate package distribution, with no indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious code.",
