  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pyprettifier' Python package, handling package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file from the package directory to generate the long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data is processed or executed in a way that can lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "The file path read from the filesystem is used to load the README content for the long description; no user input or external data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The code is standard setup script for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup-related modules, reads a local README file for documentation, and specifies package metadata and dependencies. All actions are typical for a Python package setup. No untrusted data processing, code execution, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
