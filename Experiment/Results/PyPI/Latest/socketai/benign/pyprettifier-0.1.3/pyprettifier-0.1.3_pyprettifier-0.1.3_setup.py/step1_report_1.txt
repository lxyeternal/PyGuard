  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pyprettifier', used to configure package installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file to obtain long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content as long_description, which is used in package metadata; no external data flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs detected. The code performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities, reads a local README file for long description, and configures package metadata such as name, version, author, dependencies, and Python version requirements. All actions are typical for Python package setup files. No user input, untrusted data handling, or malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares the package metadata for distribution.",
