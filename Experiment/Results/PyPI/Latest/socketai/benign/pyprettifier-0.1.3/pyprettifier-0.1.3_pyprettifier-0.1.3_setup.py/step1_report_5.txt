  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'pyprettifier' Python utility.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file from the current directory to obtain long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; the code primarily reads local files and defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "The code reads local file content for description, then passes static configuration data to setuptools for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard packaging modules, reads a local README file for long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata and dependencies. No user input, network activity, or untrusted data processing is present. The code appears to be a typical, legitimate setup script for packaging Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
