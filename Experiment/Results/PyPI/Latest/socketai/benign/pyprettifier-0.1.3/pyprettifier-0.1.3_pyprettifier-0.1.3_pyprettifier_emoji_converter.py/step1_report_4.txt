  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for converting, replacing, and removing emojis in text, and updates emoji data from an external URL.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URL during initialization if 'update' is True.",
  "sinks": "The only network activity is an HTTP GET request to 'https://2ly.link/1zroy' during object instantiation.",
  "flows": "Upon creating an EmojiConverter instance with update=True, a network request is made. No further network or data flow is observed in the functions.",
  "anomalies": "The class performs a network request to an external URL during initialization which appears unrelated to the core emoji functionality. No other suspicious or malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden behaviors, is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary of emojis and provides static methods to convert emoji names to characters, replace strings with emojis, replace emojis with names, substitute emojis with custom alternatives, and remove emojis from text. The only network activity occurs during object instantiation, where it fetches data from an external URL, ostensibly to update the emoji list, but the response is not processed or validated. This external call could be used for tracking or fetching updates, but without further context or response handling, its malicious potential is low. The core functions are straightforward text replacements with no suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for emoji handling with an optional update feature that contacts an external URL. No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident. The external request is a potential privacy concern but does not constitute malware or a direct security threat in the current form.",
