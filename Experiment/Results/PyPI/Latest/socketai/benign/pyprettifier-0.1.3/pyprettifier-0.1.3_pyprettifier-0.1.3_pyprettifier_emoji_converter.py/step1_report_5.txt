  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to convert, replace, and remove emojis in text, including updating emoji data from an external URL.",
  "sources": "Requests data from an external URL during initialization if 'update' is True.",
  "sinks": "Uses the requests library to fetch data from an external URL; no other sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Initialization may trigger an external HTTP GET request; subsequent methods manipulate text data in-memory.",
  "anomalies": "Requests is used solely for a GET request to a specified URL without handling response content or errors explicitly; no evidence of malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or secret leaks are present. Emoji replacement functions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary of emoji names to characters and a class with static methods for converting emoji names to characters and vice versa, replacing emojis in text, and removing emojis. The only external network activity occurs during initialization, where it performs a GET request to a URL (https://2ly.link/1zroy) if 'update' is True. This request does not process or store the response, and no other network activity is observed. No malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code appears benign, serving as a utility for emoji handling. No obfuscation or malware patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign emoji utility with a single, straightforward external request during initialization. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behaviors, and no security risks are evident based on its content.",
