{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs basic file operations and possibly some data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads from input files, environment variables, or user input (if present).",
  "sinks": "Writes to output files, standard output, or network (if present).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through various processing functions or operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily uses standard library functions for file I/O and data processing. No signs of malicious payloads, such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. Since no sensitive data handling, environment variables, or network activity is explicitly present, the risk appears minimal. The code does not contain any anomalies or suspicious constructs that suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to serve a benign purpose with no apparent supply chain or security vulnerabilities.",
