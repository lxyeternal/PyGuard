  "purpose": "Analysis of supply chain security and malicious behavior in Python package code.",
  "sources": "Dynamic imports, eval/exec, hardcoded strings, environment variables, network activity, file writes, subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system, environment variables, subprocess executions, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into eval/exec, network, or file sinks, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, dynamic imports, eval/exec with untrusted inputs, hardcoded credentials or URLs, suspicious control flow, high obfuscation scores.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and hardcoded secrets, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. Reports with high obfuscation and suspicious behaviors (e.g., eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, network activity) justify higher malware and security risk scores. Benign reports lack these indicators. Adjustments to scores should reflect the severity of suspicious patterns; notably, reports 2 and 4 should have their malware scores increased to approximately 0.55-0.6, and security risk scores to 0.6-0.65, aligning with their behaviors. Report 3's high suspicion warrants a malware score of 0.75 and security risk of 0.8. Other reports are consistent with their benign or cautious assessments.",
  "conclusion": "Most scores are appropriate and consistent with the behaviors described. Reports 2 and 4 should have slightly higher malware and risk scores to better reflect their suspicious patterns. Overall, the assessments align well with the evidence, with report 3 being the most concerning and warranting close scrutiny before deployment.",
