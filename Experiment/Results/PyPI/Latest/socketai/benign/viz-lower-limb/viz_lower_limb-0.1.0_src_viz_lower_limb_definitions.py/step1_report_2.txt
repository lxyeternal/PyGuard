{
  "purpose": "Define constants and variables for a larger application, possibly related to data processing or visualization.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources or data reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "No data output, network communication, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways are evident since the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The variables are simple constants related to configuration or visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting of variable declarations for constants such as dummy variables, gain factors, buffer size, update rate, and color codes. There are no functions, input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident. The variables are typical for configuration purposes and do not present any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines constants likely used elsewhere in a larger application. No security threats or malware indications are identified.",
