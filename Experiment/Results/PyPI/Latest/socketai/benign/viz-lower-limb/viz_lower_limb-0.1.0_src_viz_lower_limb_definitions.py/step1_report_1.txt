{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of constants and a docstring, likely for use in a larger application or script, to improve readability and maintainability.",
  "sources": "No input sources are present; all data are hardcoded constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks, external data outputs, or system interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The constants appear benign, mostly configuration-like values.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a docstring and several constants defining variables such as a dummy variable, gain, buffer size, update rate, and color codes. These are typical configuration parameters with no dynamic execution or external data handling. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are observed. The code is straightforward and clean, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration snippet containing constants for application settings. There are no indications of malicious intent or security concerns.",
