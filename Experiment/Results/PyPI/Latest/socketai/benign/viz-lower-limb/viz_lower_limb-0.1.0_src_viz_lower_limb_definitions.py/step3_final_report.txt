  "purpose": "This code defines a set of configuration constants and a docstring, serving as static data for a larger application.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments and the docstring serve as data sources; no external input or dynamic data handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; all data is static and assigned at definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward with simple constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static set of configuration constants with no dynamic or external interactions. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external data handling confirm its benign nature. All signals indicate a safe, non-malicious snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores across reports are consistent and appropriate, reflecting the code's harmless nature.",
