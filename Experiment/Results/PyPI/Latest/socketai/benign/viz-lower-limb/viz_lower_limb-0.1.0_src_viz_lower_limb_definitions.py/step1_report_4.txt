{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define constants and variables, possibly for a configuration or parameter setting in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; all are variable and constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is being sent, stored insecurely, or used in vulnerable operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments. No hardcoded credentials or secret keys identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments for configuration parameters and color codes. There are no functions, input/output operations, or external data interactions. It appears to be static configuration data, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration or constants definition. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on the provided snippet.",
