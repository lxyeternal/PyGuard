  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code provided.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of constant definitions and a docstring.\n   - No dynamic code, input/output, or external interactions are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The constants are benign, configuration-like values.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - They uniformly state that there are no data flows, no external data, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis and seem reasonable given the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The `malware` score is 0, indicating no malicious intent.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, confirming no obfuscation.\n   - Since the code is purely static configuration with no suspicious elements, higher scores are unjustified.\n\n5. **Challenge Assumptions About Vulnerabilities:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they do not speculate about vulnerabilities or potential exploits.\n   - They base their conclusions on the absence of dynamic behavior, external inputs, or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate for each report.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a simple, static configuration snippet with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The uniform scores across reports are justified and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                     |\n| Security Risk   | 0                     |\n\n**Note:** The initial report scores align well with the actual code's nature. No adjustments are needed.",
