  "purpose": "Define constants and variables, likely for configuration or visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "None; no input reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or sensitive information output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be straightforward constant definitions with no unusual or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments and a docstring. Variables include a dummy variable, a gain factor, buffer size, update rate, and some color hex codes. All values are static constants without any dynamic behavior, user input handling, or external data fetching. There are no functions, no I/O operations, and no suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of constant definitions with no indication of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger application for configuration or visualization purposes. No malware or security risks identified.",
