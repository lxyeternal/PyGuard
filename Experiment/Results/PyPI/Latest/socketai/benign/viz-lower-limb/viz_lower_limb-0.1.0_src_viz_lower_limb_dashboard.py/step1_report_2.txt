{
  "purpose": "The code creates a Dash web application to visualize IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor data including acceleration, gyroscope, and orientation in real-time.",
  "sources": "Data sources include 'live_data' (instance of LiveData) which provides sensor readings such as acceleration, gyroscope, and quaternion orientation; 'start_imu_thread' function initializes live data streaming from a device.",
  "sinks": "Data from 'live_data' is used to generate plots; no untrusted input handling or external data sinks are explicitly present in the code.",
  "flows": "LiveData provides sensor data -> visualization functions generate plots -> displayed on web dashboard; data flow appears straightforward without external untrusted data manipulation or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. The functions are primarily for data visualization. The only external functions called are 'start_imu_thread' and 'LiveData' which are imported modules; their implementation isn't shown here, but their usage appears standard for sensor data streaming.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a dashboard application for visualizing sensor data. It registers callbacks to update plots based on live data from an external thread. The visualization functions generate 3D orientation axes and time series plots. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The 'start_imu_thread' likely starts sensor data collection, which is typical for such applications. There are no uses of eval, exec, or system commands; no network communications are visible here that could indicate data leakage. The code appears to be a legitimate visualization tool without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard implementation of a real-time data visualization dashboard for IMU sensors. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It operates solely within its intended purpose, and no suspicious or malicious activities are detected.",
