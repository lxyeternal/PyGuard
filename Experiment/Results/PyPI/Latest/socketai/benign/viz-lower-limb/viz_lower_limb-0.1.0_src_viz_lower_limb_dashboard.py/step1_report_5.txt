    "Callback functions generate figures based on latest data",
    "Figures are rendered in the web dashboard"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials, secret keys, or sensitive data present",
    "No use of insecure functions or data leaks",
    "External library functions appear standard and properly used",
    "start_imu_thread is a custom import; its implementation is not shown, but based on naming, likely starts a data collection thread without suspicious behavior"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Dash web application to visualize IMU data, registering callbacks to update plots periodically. It uses standard libraries and practices for plotting and sensor data handling. The start_imu_thread function is invoked to initiate data collection but appears benign as it is typical for sensor data collection. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration is found. The code primarily handles data visualization with no suspicious network activity or secret data handling. Overall, the code is a typical sensor visualization dashboard with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a sensor data dashboard with no malicious behavior detected. It reads sensor data, visualizes it, and runs a web server for display. No security threats or malicious code were identified.",
