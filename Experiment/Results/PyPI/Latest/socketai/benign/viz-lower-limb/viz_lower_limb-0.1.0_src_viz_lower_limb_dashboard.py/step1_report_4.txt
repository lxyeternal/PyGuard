{
  "purpose": "To create a web-based dashboard for visualizing IMU sensor data in real-time using Dash and Plotly.",
  "sources": "Reads sensor data from the 'LiveData' object, imports modules like 'dash', 'numpy', 'plotly', 'scipy', and 'uart_ble' for sensor data acquisition and visualization.",
  "sinks": "Data visualization components (dcc.Graph), callback functions updating figures based on live data, and the start_imu_thread function initiating data collection.",
  "flows": "Sensor data is collected via 'start_imu_thread' into 'live_data', which is then used in callback functions to update plots periodically based on 'n_intervals'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows observed. The 'start_imu_thread' function is external, presumed to handle sensor data acquisition normally. No code injections or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Dash app for real-time visualization of IMU data, utilizing standard libraries and well-structured callback functions. It registers callback functions for updating plots with latest sensor readings, generates 3D orientation plots, and time-series data plots. The external 'start_imu_thread' function suggests sensor data collection running in background, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, unauthorized network activity, or hidden backdoors. The code appears clean, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a real-time sensor data dashboard with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended for visualization purposes only.",
