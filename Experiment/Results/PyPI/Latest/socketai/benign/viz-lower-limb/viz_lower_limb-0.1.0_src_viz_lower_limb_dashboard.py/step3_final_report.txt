{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Dash-based web dashboard for real-time visualization of IMU sensor data, including acceleration, gyroscope, and orientation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'live_data' object, which is populated by the external 'start_imu_thread' function from the 'uart_ble' module.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from 'live_data' into the visualization components; no external data sinks or network transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Sensor data from 'live_data' (populated via 'start_imu_thread') flows into the plotting functions for visualization; no external data leaks or network activity are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are present. External functions are presumed legitimate; no malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a real-time IMU data visualization dashboard using standard libraries (dash, plotly, numpy, scipy). It reads sensor data from a 'LiveData' object, updated by an external thread ('start_imu_thread'), and visualizes acceleration, gyroscope, and orientation data. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or external data exfiltration. The external thread's implementation is not shown but is assumed to be standard for sensor data collection. The code does not perform network communication, file writing, or system modifications. The data flow is internal and solely for visualization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured sensor data visualization dashboard with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. External dependencies ('start_imu_thread') are presumed benign. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
