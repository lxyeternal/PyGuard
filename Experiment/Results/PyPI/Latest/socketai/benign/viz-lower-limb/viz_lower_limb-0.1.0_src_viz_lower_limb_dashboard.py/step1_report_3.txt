{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Dash web application to visualize IMU sensor data in real-time, including acceleration, gyroscopic data, and orientation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'live_data' object (likely updated by a separate thread via 'start_imu_thread'), and reads configuration constants from 'definitions'. Uses 'start_imu_thread' from 'uart_ble' to initiate data collection.",
  "sinks": "Generates and displays graphical plots based on live sensor data. No data is written to external files or sent over the network within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'live_data' object, which is populated by the 'start_imu_thread' process, into visualization functions that create plots. The app's callback periodically fetches latest data to update the figures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are evident. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic code execution present. The only external process initiated is 'start_imu_thread', which is presumably responsible for data collection; this seems legitimate given context.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a web dashboard for sensor data visualization, initializing data collection via 'start_imu_thread'. The app dynamically updates plots based on the 'live_data' object. No network communication, file access, or system commands are present in this code segment. The data handling appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious data leaks or code injection. The callback mechanism and data flow are standard for Dash apps. The 'start_imu_thread' function's implementation is external and not provided here; without that, full security validation is limited, but based on this code, it appears as a legitimate data collection process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sensor data visualization dashboard with no apparent malicious intent or security risks within this code segment. It depends on external modules and functions for data collection, but none indicate malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
