  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code creates a dashboard for IMU data visualization, matching the code's purpose. The sources correctly identify 'live_data', 'definitions', and 'start_imu_thread'.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks are evident; data flows from sensor to visualization only.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or external network activity. The code is straightforward, using standard libraries.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that there's no malicious behavior is justified. Confidence is high (1.0). Malware score is 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment appears accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the app as a real-time IMU visualization. The sources mention 'LiveData' and 'start_imu_thread' appropriately.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from 'live_data' to plots, no external sinks.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The external 'start_imu_thread' is assumed legitimate.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report states no malicious intent, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0, security risk 0.1 — seems reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The assessment aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code visualizes IMU data, with 'start_imu_thread' and 'live_data'.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into visualization; no external data sinks.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The external 'start_imu_thread' is presumed legitimate.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior detected; confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code's function and data sources.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies data flow from 'live_data' into visualization.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The external 'start_imu_thread' appears standard.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid assessment; no malicious activity. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-founded.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code creates a visualization dashboard, with appropriate sources.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from 'live_data' to plots; no external sinks.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The 'start_imu_thread' is external but appears legitimate.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior; confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is consistent with the code. No malicious code, no obfuscated parts, no suspicious external calls or data leaks.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and readable.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All are low (around 0.1–0.2), justified by the lack of malicious activity but acknowledging external thread initiation.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n- No modifications are necessary based on the provided code and reports.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to external thread start, which is typical for such applications.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured IMU data visualization dashboard with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
