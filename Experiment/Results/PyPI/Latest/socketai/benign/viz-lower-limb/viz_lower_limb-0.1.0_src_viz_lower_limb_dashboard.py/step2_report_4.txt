  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard visualization dashboard for IMU data.\n- Data flow: From 'live_data' (populated by 'start_imu_thread') to visualization.\n- Anomalies: None; no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is straightforward, with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The 'start_imu_thread' function's implementation isn't shown, but its usage appears standard. The data visualization logic is typical, and no external threats are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar IMU visualization app.\n- Data flow: From 'live_data' via 'start_imu_thread' into plots.\n- Anomalies: None; external modules used are standard.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (very low)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis correctly notes no malicious code or suspicious data handling. The minimal security risk is acknowledged, likely due to external function calls, but nothing indicates malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Data flow: From 'live_data' updated by 'start_imu_thread'.\n- Anomalies: None; external functions seem legitimate.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2 (still very low)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments, no malicious activity is detected. The external data collection process appears normal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same dashboard.\n- Data flow: From external 'start_imu_thread' into 'live_data', then visualization.\n- Anomalies: None; standard libraries and functions.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo signs of malicious behavior; the code is a typical sensor visualization app.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same.\n- Data flow: Similar, from 'start_imu_thread' into 'live_data' and visualization.\n- Anomalies: None; standard practices.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, no malicious activity or suspicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** No. All reports agree that the code is standard, with no obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.\n- **External functions ('start_imu_thread') and 'LiveData':** Their implementation isn't shown, but their usage appears typical for sensor data collection.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None identified. The data flows are straightforward, and no external network activity or data exfiltration is indicated.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis. Security risks are minimal and justified by the external data collection process, but no actual malicious activity is evident.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, as no obfuscation is detected.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0, but justified as 0.2 at most, considering external data collection. Given the absence of malicious activity, this is reasonable.\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, legitimate real-time IMU data visualization dashboard with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The external 'start_imu_thread' function's implementation should be reviewed separately for completeness, but based on this code alone, it appears benign.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with external data collection, but no actual threat)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe and functions as intended for sensor data visualization.",
