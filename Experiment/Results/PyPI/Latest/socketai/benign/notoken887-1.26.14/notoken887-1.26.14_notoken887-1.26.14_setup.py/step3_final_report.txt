  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, author info, URL, and entry point specification.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes 'notoken887.main:main' during installation or runtime, which is outside this code snippet.",
  "flows": "From package metadata and entry point declaration to execution of 'main' function in 'notoken887' module.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org'), but no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or obfuscated code. Metadata raises trust concerns but does not constitute malicious behavior. The actual security risk depends on the implementation of the 'main' function, which is outside this scope. Malware score is justified as 0 due to lack of malicious payloads. Obfuscation score is 0 as code is clear. Risk score is between 0.2 and 0.3, primarily due to suspicious contact info and potential for malicious code in the entry point. Scores are consistent with the evidence, and no false positives are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script itself is benign; metadata concerns are noted but do not indicate malicious activity. The primary risk lies in the implementation of the 'main' function invoked by the entry point. Further review of that code is recommended before trusting or deploying this package.",
