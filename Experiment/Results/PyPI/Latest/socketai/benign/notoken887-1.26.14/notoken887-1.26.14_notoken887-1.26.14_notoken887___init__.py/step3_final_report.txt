  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input reading points include environment variables, network requests, file reads, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), and data exfiltration points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via network connections, environment variables, or file writes; dynamic code execution as a sink for obfuscated/malicious code; suspicious URLs/IPs as external data sources.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs flow into dynamic execution or data exfiltration points, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, dynamic execution (eval/exec), suspicious URLs/IPs, hardcoded credentials, or unusual variable names; inconsistent scoring with benign code; high obfuscation and malware indicators in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The code in reports 1-4 shows no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors, with scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and low security risk (~0.2-0.3). Confidence scores are high (0.7-0.9). Report 5 contains obfuscated code, dynamic execution, and suspicious URLs, justifying high malware (0.8-0.9), obfuscation (0.7-0.8), and security risk (~0.75). The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. Minor adjustments to report 4's security risk from 0.3 to 0.2 improve consistency, but overall, the scoring aligns well with the findings.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with negligible malicious activity, reflected by low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5 indicates high malicious potential, justified by obfuscation and dynamic code execution. Overall supply chain risk is low, with isolated high-risk indicators in report 5. Slight score adjustments for report 4 enhance consistency. The scoring system is appropriate and aligned with the analysis.",
