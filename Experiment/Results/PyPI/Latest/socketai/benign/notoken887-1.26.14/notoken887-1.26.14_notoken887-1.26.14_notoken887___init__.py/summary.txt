  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with negligible malicious activity, reflected by low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5 indicates high malicious potential, justified by obfuscation and dynamic code execution. Overall supply chain risk is low, with isolated high-risk indicators in report 5. Slight score adjustments for report 4 enhance consistency. The scoring system is appropriate and aligned with the analysis."
