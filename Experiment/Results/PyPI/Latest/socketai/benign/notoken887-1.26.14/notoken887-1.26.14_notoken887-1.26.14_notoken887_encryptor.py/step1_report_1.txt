{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution cipher methods for encrypting and decrypting strings using emoji replacements.",
  "sources": "Input data is the string passed to the encrypt method; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Output is the transformed string; no external data sinks or sensitive data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input string → encrypt method → replacement substitutions → output; and vice versa for decrypt.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious external calls. The code performs straightforward character replacements without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a basic substitution cipher with no external dependencies, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The methods only perform direct string replacements to encode or decode messages using emojis, which could serve as an obfuscation layer but do not constitute malicious activity. There are no signs of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears benign, primarily serving as a simple encoding/decoding utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple substitution cipher utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions, access external systems, or contain hidden backdoors. It is safe but offers minimal security since substitution ciphers are easily reversible and insecure for sensitive data.",
