{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple obfuscation and de-obfuscation of strings through character replacement with emojis and other symbols.",
  "sources": "Input data is passed to the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods as string parameters.",
  "sinks": "The methods return the transformed strings; no external data sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via sequential character replacements in 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, with direct source-to-sink flow within the functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code only performs character substitution without any network activity, file I/O, or hidden code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. No obfuscation techniques or hidden logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The class functions as a simple reversible character mapping, replacing standard characters with emojis and vice versa. The implementation is straightforward, with explicit replacement rules. No external dependencies, network connections, or malicious code behaviors are detected. The design appears to serve for string obfuscation or playful encoding, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign, reversible character substitution utility with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks.",
