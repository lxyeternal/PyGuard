      "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and performs its intended function without malicious intent. The main security consideration is the use of pickle.load() on a local file, which could be exploited if the pickle is malicious. No active malware or malicious behavior is evident. The assigned scores are consistent with the potential risk posed by untrusted pickle files, but overall, the code is safe if the pickle source is trusted."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign and well-structured, with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from external dependencies, which are outside the scope of this review. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting moderate concern due to external functions."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign with respect to malicious intent. The primary security concern is the hardcoded API key, which should be managed securely. No malware or obfuscation detected. The security risk score is justified at approximately 0.3, reflecting the API key exposure without active malicious behavior."
