{
  "purpose": "The code performs text processing, embedding, and similarity matching to map skills to an ESCO taxonomy, with data loaded from external sources and saved locally.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include a DataFrame (`extracted_df`), a CSV from a URL, and a pickle file containing ESCO embeddings.",
  "sinks": "The code writes the resulting DataFrame to a CSV file ('best_esco_matches.csv') locally.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame is processed and mapped using the embedding model, then saved as CSV; embeddings are loaded from a pickle file and external CSV is fetched over the network.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `pickle.load()` on a file path derived from the current script’s directory; external CSV loaded directly over HTTP; no validation or sanitization of external data or pickle contents.",
  "analysis": "The code loads embeddings via pickle from a file within the package directory, which could potentially be malicious if the pickle file is tampered with, as pickle can execute arbitrary code during unpickling. External CSV is fetched over HTTP without validation, but this alone is not malicious. Data processing involves normal operations with third-party libraries. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is present. The code is straightforward in purpose and structure, with no obfuscated parts or malware indicators. The use of pickle is the most notable risk, especially if the pickle file is sourced from untrusted or compromised locations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform standard data processing and embedding operations for skill mapping, with no clear malicious intent. However, the use of pickle to load embeddings from a local file could pose a security risk if the pickle file is compromised or maliciously crafted, as pickle can execute arbitrary code during unpickling. External data fetching is not inherently malicious but should be validated. Overall, low suspicion of malicious behavior but a potential security concern regarding untrusted pickle files.",
