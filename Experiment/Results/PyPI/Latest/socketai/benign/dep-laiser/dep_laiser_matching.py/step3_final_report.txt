  "purpose": "Performs semantic mapping of skills to ESCO taxonomy using embeddings, loading precomputed embeddings from a pickle file and external data from a CSV URL.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV data from a public URL; loads ESCO embeddings via pickle from a local file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network transmission or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Loads embeddings via pickle; fetches CSV over HTTP; processes data; saves results locally.",
  "anomalies": "Uses pickle.load() on a local file, which can execute arbitrary code if the pickle is malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard semantic matching tasks with external data sources and precomputed embeddings. The use of pickle for loading embeddings is common but poses a security risk if the pickle file is compromised, as pickle can execute arbitrary code during unpickling. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The network activity is limited to fetching a CSV from a trusted source. The overall logic is straightforward and aligns with typical data processing pipelines. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the pickle file; if untrusted, it could be malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.2, security risk 0.2-0.3) are appropriate given this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and performs its intended function without malicious intent. The main security consideration is the use of pickle.load() on a local file, which could be exploited if the pickle is malicious. No active malware or malicious behavior is evident. The assigned scores are consistent with the potential risk posed by untrusted pickle files, but overall, the code is safe if the pickle source is trusted.",
