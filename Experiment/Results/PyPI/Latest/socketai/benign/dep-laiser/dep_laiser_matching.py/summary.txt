  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and performs its intended function without malicious intent. The main security consideration is the use of pickle.load() on a local file, which could be exploited if the pickle is malicious. No active malware or malicious behavior is evident. The assigned scores are consistent with the potential risk posed by untrusted pickle files, but overall, the code is safe if the pickle source is trusted."
