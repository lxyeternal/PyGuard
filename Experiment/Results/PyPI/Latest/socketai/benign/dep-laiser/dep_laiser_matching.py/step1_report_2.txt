{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform semantic mapping of skills from a DataFrame to an ESCO taxonomy using sentence embeddings.",
  "sources": "Reads input DataFrame `extracted_df`, loads ESCO embeddings from a pickle file, and fetches ESCO labels from a remote CSV URL.",
  "sinks": "Uses the loaded ESCO embeddings and input DataFrame to produce a mapped DataFrame, saving results to a CSV file.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame → enrich_raw_row function → sentence transformer encode → cosine similarity → best match selection → output DataFrame → save CSV.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the pickle file is loaded from a relative path; the URL fetch is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and processes data with common techniques: applying functions, encoding text, computing similarities, and saving results. It loads embeddings via pickle and fetches data from a public URL, both typical practices. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is evident. The pickle file is loaded from a relative path, which is typical for project data files. The URL used for fetching ESCO labels is a public dataset, not suspicious. Overall, the code performs a straightforward data mapping task without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate data processing task without signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It loads data and models securely, performs in-memory computations, and outputs results without any suspicious network activity or data leakage. No malicious or maliciously disguised code elements are identified.",
