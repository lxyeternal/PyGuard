{
  "purpose": "The code maps extracted skill data to an ESCO taxonomy using embeddings and cosine similarity, and saves the mapping results to a CSV file.",
  "sources": "Reads a CSV file from a GitHub URL, reads a pickle file containing ESCO embeddings from the filesystem, loads a pre-trained sentence transformer model, and reads input data from a pandas DataFrame.",
  "sinks": "Saves a CSV file ('best_esco_matches.csv') locally. No network sinks for untrusted data, no data exfiltration or remote command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input DataFrame and external CSV and pickle files, through embedding and similarity computations, to output DataFrame and CSV file.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script loads ESCO embeddings from a pickle file, reads ESCO labels from a remote CSV, initializes a SentenceTransformer model, and performs semantic similarity matching. The data flow is straightforward: input DataFrame -> embedding -> similarity computation -> output DataFrame -> CSV file. There are no signs of malicious code such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modifications. All external data sources are standard and appear legitimate. The use of pickle could potentially pose security risks if the pickle file is compromised, but this is a standard practice for loading serialized objects, and no malicious intent is indicated. The code does not include any code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical semantic matching process with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It reads external data, processes it, and saves the output locally without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
