  "purpose": "The code maps extracted skills data to the ESCO taxonomy using sentence embeddings and cosine similarity, then outputs the best matches.",
  "sources": "Reads input DataFrame 'extracted_df', loads ESCO embeddings from a pickle file, reads CSV from a URL, loads sentence transformer model.",
  "sinks": "Loads embeddings from a pickle file; writes output CSV file 'best_esco_matches.csv'.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> encode texts with SentenceTransformer -> compute cosine similarity -> select best matches -> save results to CSV.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle.load on an external file without validation; loading model within function repeatedly; no evident obfuscation or malicious code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data enrichment, encoding, similarity computation, and result saving. It loads ESCO embeddings via pickle from a local path, which could be manipulated if the pickle file is compromised. The CSV data is loaded from a URL, which introduces external dependency but not necessarily malicious. The core functions rely on standard libraries and are typical for semantic matching tasks. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The repeated loading of models and data could be inefficient but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to implement a typical skill-mapping process with no obvious malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs semantic skill mapping using embeddings with no evident malicious behavior. It relies on standard libraries and external resources in a typical manner. The only notable concern is the loading of pickle data from an external path, which could pose a security risk if the pickle file is compromised, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.",
