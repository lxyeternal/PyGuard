  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code behavior, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code maps skills to ESCO using embeddings, loads data from a CSV URL and a pickle file, and saves results locally. No suspicious activity is observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The only minor concern is the use of pickle, which could be risky if the pickle file is compromised, but this is a standard practice and not malicious by itself.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed explanation. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code loads data from public sources and uses standard libraries.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that pickle loading could be risky if the pickle file is compromised, as pickle can execute arbitrary code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.2\n- **Security risk:** 0.3\n- **Assessment:** The mention of pickle's potential security risk is accurate. The code itself does not appear malicious, but the pickle file's integrity is a concern.\n- **Justification for scores:** The malware score of 0.2 is justified given the inherent risk of untrusted pickle files. The security risk score of 0.3 is also reasonable, considering the potential for malicious pickle content.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with no signs of malicious activity. The main concern is again the use of pickle.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The malware score of zero is acceptable; the risk score reflects the potential danger of untrusted pickle files.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior observed. Uses standard practices. The concern about pickle remains.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with previous analyses. The potential risk is acknowledged but not indicative of malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.2) scores, mainly due to the use of pickle, which is a known vector for arbitrary code execution if the pickle file is compromised. Since there's no evidence of malicious code, the low scores are justified.\n- **Obfuscated code:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated (0.2–0.3) due to pickle usage, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The main concern is the potential security risk posed by loading pickle files from local paths without validation. If the pickle file is from an untrusted source, it could be malicious.\n- No evidence suggests active malware or malicious intent.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.1 (since no malicious code observed, but the pickle risk warrants some caution)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (consistent with reports, reflecting the pickle security concern)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears legitimate and performs standard data processing tasks. The main security concern is the unverified pickle file, which should be validated or loaded from trusted sources to mitigate potential risks.",
