{
  "purpose": "The code performs mapping of skill-related data to an external taxonomy (ESCO) using embedding similarity and generates a CSV report of the best matches.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame 'extracted_df', ESCO CSV from URL, ESCO embeddings loaded from a pickle file, and external model 'SentenceTransformer'.",
  "sinks": "Saving the resulting DataFrame to 'best_esco_matches.csv' locally; no other sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame is processed into text, encoded with a model, compared with embeddings loaded from a pickle file, and results are saved to a CSV.",
  "anomalies": "The use of pickle.load() on a local file path is standard; no signs of obfuscation or suspicious code. No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. External URL is for CSV data, not code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code loads external data and embeddings, processes text data with a well-known transformer model, and performs similarity matching. It saves results locally without any network communication beyond reading CSV and loading pickle. No malicious code patterns, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Usage appears consistent with typical data processing tasks. No obfuscated or malicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate data processing and similarity matching using standard libraries and methods. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
