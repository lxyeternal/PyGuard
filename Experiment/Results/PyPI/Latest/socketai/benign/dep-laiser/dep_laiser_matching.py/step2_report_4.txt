  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code maps skills to ESCO using embeddings, loads data from a CSV URL and a pickle file, and saves results locally. No suspicious behavior observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The use of pickle is standard, and no malicious activity is evident. The low security risk score reflects awareness of potential pickle issues but considers the current context safe.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar process; no obfuscation or malicious code detected. Data sources are legitimate, and no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the straightforward nature of the code. No malicious behavior, and the security risk is minimal.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Noted that pickle is loaded from a local file, which could be malicious if the pickle is compromised, as pickle can execute arbitrary code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.2\n- **Security risk:** 0.3\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly flags the potential risk associated with untrusted pickle files. While no malicious activity is observed, the risk is acknowledged.\n- **Justification for scores:** The malware score is low but non-zero, reflecting the inherent risk of untrusted pickle files. The security risk score is moderate, aligning with this concern.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with standard data loading and processing. No malicious code detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The use of pickle is noted but not flagged as malicious.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The code loads embeddings via pickle and fetches external CSV data. No obfuscation or malicious code observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The potential risk from pickle remains, but no malicious activity is detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0 or very low (0.2), reflecting the potential risk of pickle but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated code:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher where pickle is involved, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The main concern across these reports is the use of `pickle.load()` on local files, which can be risky if the pickle files are compromised. This is acknowledged in the scores.\n- No reports suggest actual malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The scores are consistent with the described code and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.1 (due to the inherent risk of pickle, but no actual malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (considering the pickle risk and external data fetches)\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to perform a standard semantic matching task with minimal security concerns, primarily related to untrusted pickle files. Proper validation or use of safer serialization methods could mitigate this risk further.",
