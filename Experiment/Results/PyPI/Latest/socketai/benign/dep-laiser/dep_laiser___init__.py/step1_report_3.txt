  "purpose": "Re-export a single public entry-point function from the main module",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main import extract_skills",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only module export definitions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, re-exporting a function; no anomalies or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function 'extract_skills' from a local module '.main' and exposes it via __all__ for public API purposes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, no code execution, data handling, or external communication. The code is minimal, clear, and follows standard Python practices for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module re-export with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
