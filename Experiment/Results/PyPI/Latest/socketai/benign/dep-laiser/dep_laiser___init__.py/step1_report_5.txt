{
  "purpose": "Re-export a single public entry-point function 'extract_skills' from the 'main' module for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports and exports a function within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only establishes an export interface.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and solely responsible for re-exporting a function from a local module. There are no sources of external data, no sinks, and no complex logic. It is a standard pattern for controlling API exposure in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple re-export statement with no suspicious activity.",
