  "purpose": "This code re-exports a single function 'extract_skills' from a local module 'main' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'extract_skills' from a local module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling occurs",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; only module re-exporting",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a specific function from a local module and exposes it via __all__, which is a standard Python practice for controlling module exports. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious code or behavior. It does not interact with external data, network, or perform any system operations. The code is minimal, straightforward, and adheres to common patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions solely as a module export configuration.",
