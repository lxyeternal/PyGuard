  "purpose": "Re-export a single public entry-point function 'extract_skills' from the main module",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .main import extract_skills'",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations",
  "flows": "Import statement simply exposes 'extract_skills'; no data flow from external sources or to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements observed",

  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward re-export of a function without any malicious behavior or security issues.",
