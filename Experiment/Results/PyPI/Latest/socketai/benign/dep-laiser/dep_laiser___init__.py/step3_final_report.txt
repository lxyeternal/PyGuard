  "purpose": "Re-export a single public entry-point 'extract_skills' from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .main import extract_skills'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'extract_skills' from local module; no data flow beyond module import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module re-export pattern. It imports a function from a local module and exposes it via __all__, with no data processing, external inputs, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions support a conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is a standard module re-export, and the provided reports are accurate and consistent. No changes or additional scrutiny are necessary.",
