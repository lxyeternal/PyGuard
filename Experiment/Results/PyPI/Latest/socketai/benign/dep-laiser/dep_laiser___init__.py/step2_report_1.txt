  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\nFirst, I note that all reports describe the code as a straightforward re-export of a single function 'extract_skills' from a local module 'main'. They consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, malware, or security risks. The code is minimal: just an import statement and an __all__ declaration.\n\n**Confirming the code's content:**\n- The original code matches the description: it imports 'extract_skills' from '.main' and defines __all__ = ['extract_skills']. No other code or data is present.\n\n**Evaluation of the reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard practice for module exports.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is claimed or observed.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or external data flows are present.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- malware: all reports assign 0, which is consistent with the benign nature.\n- obfuscated: all assign 0, which is correct.\n- securityRisk: all assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- Since the code is so minimal and straightforward, there is little room for malicious activity. However, I should consider whether the import source ('from .main') could be malicious if the 'main' module is compromised or malicious. But since this is just a static import statement, and the module is local, it does not in itself introduce risk unless the 'main' module is malicious, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's simplicity.\n\n**Final note:**\n- No further action required. The code is safe and standard for module re-exporting.",
