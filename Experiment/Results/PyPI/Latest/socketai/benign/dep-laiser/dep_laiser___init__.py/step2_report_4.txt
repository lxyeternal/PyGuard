  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   The provided code:\n   ```python\n   from .main import extract_skills\n\n   __all__ = [\"extract_skills\"]\n   ```\n   is a straightforward module that re-exports a single function from a local module. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Report Consistency & Validity**:\n   All five reports agree that the code is benign, minimal, and serves solely as an API re-export. They correctly identify the absence of data flows, sinks, or anomalies. The analysis in each report is consistent with the code snippet.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Reports**:\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly dismiss any suspicion of malicious activity or security issues.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as a standard practice for API exposure.\n\n4. **Scores Review**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is justified.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Justification**:\n   - Since the code is a simple re-export with no external input, no data processing, and no suspicious constructs, the risk score of 0 is correct.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is present or implied.\n   - Obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n6. **Potential Assumptions or Claims**:\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made beyond the benign analysis.\n   - The reports do not assume malicious intent where none exists.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Analysis**:\n   - The scores align perfectly with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- Malware score should remain at 0.\n- Obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- Risk score should remain at 0.\n\n**My personal estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, safe re-export pattern with no security concerns. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
