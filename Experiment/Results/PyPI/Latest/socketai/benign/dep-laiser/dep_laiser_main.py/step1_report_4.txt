{
  "purpose": "The code loads syllabi data, processes it with an LLM to extract skills, parses the results, and performs ESCO mapping on the extracted data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a CSV file via pandas.read_csv; receives input data from function arguments; calls external functions generate_structured_skills and run_esco_mapping.",
  "sinks": "None apparent. The code does not write data to external systems or perform network operations directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV reading into pandas DataFrame -> processed by generate_structured_skills -> parsed by parse_results -> further processed and mapped by run_esco_mapping.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of environment variables; no obfuscated or malicious code patterns; no network communication or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles data loading, calling external functions for AI processing, and parsing JSON or literal eval outputs. It does not contain suspicious or malicious behavior. Functions like generate_structured_skills and run_esco_mapping are imported, and their internal behavior is unknown, but based on context, they seem to perform data processing. The code reads data from a public URL, processes it without dangerous operations, and does not perform any network calls or system modifications within the provided snippet. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are observed. Overall, the code appears to be a typical data pipeline for skill extraction from syllabi.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard data processing pipeline that interacts with external AI models and mapping functions. No malicious or suspicious activities are evident. It appears safe based on the provided snippet.",
