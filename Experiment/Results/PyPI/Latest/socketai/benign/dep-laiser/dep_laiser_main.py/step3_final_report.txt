  "purpose": "This code implements a data pipeline for extracting skills from syllabi data, involving loading data, calling external AI functions, parsing their outputs, and performing mapping.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV data from a URL; calls external functions 'generate_structured_skills' and 'run_esco_mapping'; reads input data for processing.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if external functions are malicious; no direct sinks like network or file writes are present within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV load -> column renaming -> external function calls -> parsing outputs -> metadata enrichment -> mapping pipeline.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; reliance on external functions is a trust concern but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data processing pipeline with standard parsing and data handling. External functions are critical points of trust but their internal code is unknown. The parsing methods are safe, and no malicious or obfuscated code is present. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of external dependencies, but within this code snippet, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and well-structured, with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from external dependencies, which are outside the scope of this review. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting moderate concern due to external functions.",
