{
  "purpose": "The code generates structured skill analysis from input descriptions using a language model.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'description' and 'learning_outcomes' fields; configuration data such as API key.",
  "sinks": "Calls to the language model API with prompt data; no direct data leakage or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into prompt creation, then into the model.generate_content method; output is returned as JSON.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate API key configuration; no evidence of hardcoded secrets beyond API key; no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs prompts based on input data, configures a language model, and retrieves generated JSON responses. API key is hardcoded, which is a security concern for key management but not malicious behavior. No external network connections or data exfiltration observed. The use of the API appears intended for structured skill extraction tasks, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malware behaviors. No code injection, unsafe data handling, or malicious data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs structured prompt-based skill analysis via an external API, with a security concern related to hardcoded API keys but no malicious intent or harmful behavior present.",
