  "analysis": "The code imports a Google generative AI library, configures an API key twice, and constructs a prompt template for skill extraction. No malicious code, backdoors, or malware are present. The API key is hardcoded, which is a security concern but not malicious. The code's purpose is to generate structured skill analysis prompts. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. The repeated API configuration is redundant but not harmful. The main security risk is exposure of the API key, which could lead to unauthorized use but does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with respect to malicious intent. The primary security concern is the hardcoded API key, which should be managed securely. No malware or obfuscation detected. The security risk score is justified at approximately 0.3, reflecting the API key exposure without active malicious behavior.",
