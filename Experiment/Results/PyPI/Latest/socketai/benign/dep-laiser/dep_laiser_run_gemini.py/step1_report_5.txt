  "purpose": "Generate structured skill analysis from input descriptions using Google Generative AI.",
  "sources": "API key configuration, input description, prompt template, generate_content method",
  "sinks": "API key, input data, prompt text, generated content",
  "flows": "Configuration of API key -> Construction of prompt -> Call to generate_content -> Output processing",
  "anomalies": "Repeated API key configuration, no sanitization or validation of input data, use of potentially sensitive API keys in code",
  "analysis": "The code configures a Google Generative AI model with an API key, constructs prompts based on input data, and calls generate_content to produce structured JSON outputs. The API key is hardcoded, which could be a security concern if exposed. The API key appears to be a sensitive credential embedded in the code, risking unauthorized use. The code does not perform input validation or sanitization, which could be exploited for injection if inputs are malicious. There are no indications of malicious actions like data exfiltration, backdoors, or network connections beyond the AI API call. The repeated configuration of the API key is redundant but not malicious. Overall, the code’s primary concern is the exposure and hardcoding of sensitive credentials, not malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for structured skill generation via Google's Generative AI. The main security concern is the hardcoded API key, which poses a credential exposure risk. No malicious behavior or malware indications are present, but proper secret management should be implemented.",
