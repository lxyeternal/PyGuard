  "anomalies": [
    "API key is hardcoded in the source code, which is a security risk if this code is shared or published.",
    "The code does not validate or sanitize the model response, but this is standard for such APIs.",
    "The API key appears to be a public key, which may be intended for public code, but hardcoding credentials is generally unsafe."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code sets up a prompt for an LLM to analyze input text and generate structured data about skills. It imports and configures the Google Generative AI SDK, including an API key that is hardcoded, which is a security concern. The functions build prompts dynamically and invoke the model without additional validation. There are no signs of malicious code such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft; the code primarily interfaces with a third-party API. The API key should be managed securely (e.g., environment variables) to prevent exposure. Overall, the code is focused on prompt engineering and model invocation, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for generating structured skill analysis via a language model, with a notable security concern of hardcoded API keys. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The main risk lies in exposing API credentials; otherwise, the code itself is benign.",
