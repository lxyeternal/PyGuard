{
  "purpose": "This code manages legacy time range adjustments within a form data structure, specifically handling 'since', 'until', and 'granularity_sqla' fields.",
  "sources": "Reads from the input dictionary 'form_data', specifically 'since', 'until', 'granularity_sqla', and 'adhoc_filters'.",
  "sinks": "Modifies 'form_data' by removing 'since' and 'until', and setting 'time_range'.",
  "flows": "Reads 'since', 'until', and 'granularity_sqla' from 'form_data' and their associated 'adhoc_filters'; writes back 'time_range' to 'form_data'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code performs straightforward data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code extracts 'since' and 'until' from 'form_data' and combines them into a 'time_range' string. It also checks 'granularity_sqla' and related 'adhoc_filters' to potentially set 'time_range' to 'No filter'. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. The code is simple and focused on data formatting without external system calls or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data handling function with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be part of a legacy adjustment process, with no suspicious elements or malicious behavior.",
