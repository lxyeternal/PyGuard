{
  "purpose": "The code modifies a form data dictionary to adjust time range parameters, primarily for legacy or change management purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the input dictionary 'form_data', specifically the keys 'since', 'until', 'granularity_sqla', and 'adhoc_filters'.",
  "sinks": "The code writes back to 'form_data' by setting or modifying the 'time_range' key.",
  "flows": "The code reads 'since' and 'until' to create or update 'time_range'. It also reads 'granularity_sqla' and 'adhoc_filters' to conditionally update 'time_range'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code performs standard dictionary manipulations and logical checks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for handling legacy time range data. It reads specific keys from 'form_data' and updates the 'time_range' key accordingly. The logic is simple: if 'since' or 'until' are present, it combines them into a string. Additionally, if 'granularity_sqla' is set and an 'adhoc_filter' matches certain conditions, it sets 'time_range' to 'No filter'. There are no indications of malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious side effects. The functions are typical for legacy data adjustments, with no external network or system calls, no use of environment variables, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears well-structured, with clear intent and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data manipulation for legacy support without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any suspicious or harmful behavior, and it simply updates the form data as intended. Overall, the code is benign with no security concerns.",
