{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to modify and adjust time-related parameters within a form data dictionary, specifically handling legacy fields and setting a unified 'time_range'.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the 'form_data' dictionary, specifically the 'since', 'until', 'granularity_sqla', and 'adhoc_filters' keys.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the 'form_data' dictionary by setting or updating the 'time_range' key based on the input data.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'since', 'until', and 'adhoc_filters' keys flows into the conditional logic which then updates or sets 'time_range' in the same dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code features are observed; the code uses standard Python constructs and handles data in a straightforward manner.",
  "analysis": "The code handles dictionary data, popping 'since' and 'until' to form a 'time_range' string if either exists, and also sets 'time_range' to 'No filter' if certain conditions with 'adhoc_filters' are met. No external inputs, network communications, or sensitive operations are present. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate data processing related to legacy time range handling. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears safe and functional for its intended purpose.",
