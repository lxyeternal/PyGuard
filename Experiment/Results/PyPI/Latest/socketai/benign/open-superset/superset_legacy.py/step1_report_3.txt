{
  "purpose": "The code modifies a form data dictionary to update time range information based on legacy rules, mainly for handling date filters and granularity settings.",
  "sources": "Reads from the 'form_data' dictionary, specifically 'since', 'until', 'granularity_sqla', and 'adhoc_filters' keys.",
  "sinks": "Modifies 'form_data' by updating or adding the 'time_range' key.",
  "flows": "Reads 'since', 'until', and 'granularity_sqla' from 'form_data' → Checks 'adhoc_filters' within 'form_data' → Updates 'form_data' with new 'time_range' value.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The function handles data restructuring in a straightforward, non-malicious way.",
  "analysis": "The function processes input data by removing 'since' and 'until' keys and combining their values into a 'time_range' string. It also sets 'time_range' to 'No filter' if a certain filter condition is met. The code uses standard Python features and safe dictionary operations. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or data leakage is present. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate data manipulation related to form filters without any malicious intent or security issues. It is a standard data handling routine with no signs of malware or security risks.",
