  "purpose": "Handle legacy / change management by adjusting 'since' and 'until' into 'time_range' and setting 'time_range' to 'No filter' based on 'granularity_sqla' and 'adhoc_filters'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'since', 'until', 'granularity_sqla', and 'adhoc_filters' from form_data.",
  "sinks": "Modifies 'form_data' by removing 'since' and 'until', setting 'time_range', potentially overwriting it if conditions are met.",
  "flows": "Extracts 'since' and 'until', combines into 'time_range', then checks 'granularity_sqla' and 'adhoc_filters' to possibly set 'time_range' to 'No filter'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs straightforward dictionary manipulations with clear logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and performs data manipulation for legacy support. It removes 'since' and 'until' keys, then creates 'time_range'. If 'granularity_sqla' is set and 'adhoc_filters' contains a filter with 'subject' matching 'granularity_sqla' and 'comparator' as 'No filter', it sets 'time_range' to 'No filter'. No external calls, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The logic is correct, and no security issues are evident. The code is benign, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for legacy data handling, performing safe dictionary operations without malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as non-malicious, with appropriate scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No improvements are necessary.",
