{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to modify and update a dictionary containing form data related to time ranges and filters, specifically handling legacy or change management scenarios.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'form_data' dictionary, particularly from keys 'since', 'until', 'granularity_sqla', and 'adhoc_filters'.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies 'form_data' by setting or updating the 'time_range' key based on the input values and filter conditions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input dictionary through conditional checks, and the 'since' and 'until' values are combined into 'time_range', or 'time_range' is set based on filter conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs straightforward data manipulations with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The function updates form_data by extracting 'since' and 'until' values, concatenating them into a 'time_range' string if they exist, and setting 'time_range' to 'No filter' if certain conditions involving 'adhoc_filters' are met. The code uses standard Python features, including dictionary operations, list comprehensions, and conditional statements. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. It simply processes input data in a predictable manner without external communication or system manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing legacy time range data. It performs simple, legitimate data transformations without any malicious intent or security risks.",
