{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures, type annotations, and configurations for an application related to data handling, OAuth2 authentication, and SQL query management, primarily in a web application context.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data, type definitions, and possibly user or system input through variables such as OAuth2 client info, query parameters, and metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include storage or transmission of sensitive data such as OAuth2 credentials (`id`, `secret`, tokens), but no explicit data sinks or transmission code are present.",
  "flows": "OAuth2 configuration data flows from input variables to storage or network requests, but actual network calls or data transmission are not present in this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or unusual code patterns are apparent. The code mainly consists of type definitions and configuration schemas.",
  "analysis": "The code segment consists of multiple TypedDict classes defining data structures for handling metrics, columns, SQL types, OAuth2 configurations, and responses. It imports standard libraries and third-party modules, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. Sensitive data such as OAuth2 secrets are stored as plain strings but are part of configuration objects, which is typical. No network activity, file access, or data leaks are evident. The code appears to be standard schema definitions for a web data application, with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining data types and configurations with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any hardcoded secrets beyond typical configuration placeholders, nor does it include any suspicious or malicious code. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate for its purpose.",
