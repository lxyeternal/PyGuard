{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures, type annotations, and configuration schemas related to database interactions, metrics, OAuth2 authentication, and response handling in a web application, likely part of a larger data visualization or analytics platform.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and configuration dictionaries such as OAuth2ClientConfig, OAuth2TokenResponse, and OAuth2State.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the OAuth2 request parameters (id, secret, scope, redirect_uri, etc.), which could be misused if exposed; response objects in Flask responses; and the data structures containing tokens and credentials.",
  "flows": "There are no direct source-to-sink data flows within this code snippet, as it primarily consists of type definitions and configuration schemas. Sensitive data such as OAuth2 secrets and tokens could flow from input sources to the structures defined here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code consists solely of type and data structure definitions, with no executable logic, network activity, or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining data types, configuration schemas, and response formats. It includes sensitive fields such as OAuth2 client secrets, but these are part of expected configuration objects and not used in an executable or malicious manner. There are no obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears to be standard, safe boilerplate for a web data platform.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard set of type definitions and configuration schemas for a web application, with no signs of sabotage or malware. The presence of sensitive fields like OAuth secrets is typical for configuration data and does not indicate malicious intent.",
