{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures, type annotations, and imports used in a larger Python project, specifically for data handling, API responses, and OAuth2 configuration.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily read from type annotations, class attributes, and imported modules; no direct user input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this code; it mainly defines data structures without performing I/O or network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this code snippet; it is purely structural/type definition code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code appears to be standard data modeling and type annotation definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data class definitions, type annotations, and imports used for handling database types, API responses, OAuth2 configurations, and data structures. It does not contain executable logic, network calls, or input/output handling. The presence of sensitive information such as OAuth2 client secrets is purely in type annotations and not actual runtime secrets. No code injection, malicious behavior, or security risks are apparent in this static code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions and data models with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is part of a larger system, likely for a data application or API, with no evident security risks.",
