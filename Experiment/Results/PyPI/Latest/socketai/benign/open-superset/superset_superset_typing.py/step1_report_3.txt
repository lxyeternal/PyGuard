{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures, type hints, and configuration schemas for an application, likely related to database interactions, OAuth2 authentication, and data handling within a web framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data, class and type definitions, and constants; no direct input sources such as user input, environment variables, or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include OAuth2 token exchange processes and responses, but no unsafe or untrusted data handling mechanisms are directly observable in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows or source-to-sink paths involving untrusted input data; the code primarily consists of type definitions and static configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code adheres to standard data structure and type hinting conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of type definitions, class declarations, and configuration schemas for a web application dealing with database types and OAuth2 configurations. It lacks any input handling, processing logic, or external data interactions that could be exploited. The OAuth2 configurations include sensitive fields like 'id' and 'secret', but these are meant for configuration purposes, not embedded secrets or hardcoded credentials within logic. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. The structure appears standard and secure, focusing on data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type definitions and configuration schemas with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain any malicious or obfuscated code. The presence of sensitive fields like 'secret' is typical for configuration files and does not indicate compromise.",
