{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures, type annotations, and configuration schemas related to database types, OAuth2 configurations, and API response handling, with no executable logic or network activity.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, configuration fields such as 'secret', 'access_token', 'id', and 'token_request_uri'.",
  "sinks": "No data flows to external systems or untrusted sources; no network or I/O operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static data definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of fields like 'secret', 'access_token', and 'id' in configuration classes, which are placeholders for secrets but not embedded secrets or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, consisting of data schemas and type annotations. No executable code, network calls, or data processing routines are included. Sensitive fields such as OAuth2 secrets and tokens are stored as configuration parameters, which is standard practice. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities are evident. The risk scores in the reports are slightly elevated (around 0.1 to 0.2) due to the presence of sensitive fields in configuration schemas, but these are placeholders and do not constitute actual security risks. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to zero. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static data structures and configuration schemas with no malicious or obfuscated content. The minimal risk scores are appropriate, reflecting standard handling of configuration data. No security issues or malicious behaviors are present.",
