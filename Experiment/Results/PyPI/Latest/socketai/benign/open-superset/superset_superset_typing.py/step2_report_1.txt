  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the validity of their assessments, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely structural, defining data types and configurations, with no executable logic or network activity. No secrets are hardcoded; the OAuth2 secrets are placeholders in configuration objects.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as safe, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — all reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment and scoring are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes that the code is mainly type definitions and data structures with no runtime logic or data flows involving untrusted sources.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the absence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is standard data modeling with no suspicious patterns. The only concern is the presence of sensitive fields like 'secret' in configuration schemas, but these are placeholders, not embedded secrets.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification for risk=0.2:** Slightly elevated due to the presence of sensitive fields, but since these are placeholders, the risk is minimal.\n\n**Analysis:** The risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable given the context. The code does not contain actual secrets or insecure practices.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on data schemas and configuration objects, including OAuth2 secrets and tokens.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or code injection, just data structures with sensitive fields meant for configuration.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely declarative, with no executable logic, network calls, or data flows involving untrusted sources. Sensitive fields are part of configuration schemas.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — suitable.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, standard structure of the code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern primarily due to presence of sensitive fields in configuration schemas, which is typical.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the assessments that this code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk scores are appropriately low, considering the presence of sensitive fields as placeholders, not embedded secrets or malicious code.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a conservative, minimal risk score reflecting the presence of sensitive configuration fields but no actual security flaws)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, well-structured, and free of security issues or malicious intent.",
