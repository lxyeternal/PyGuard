  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and security risks, and verify if the scores assigned are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines data structures and type annotations for metrics, columns, OAuth2 configs, etc. No dynamic code, network calls, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no malicious behavior. Sensitive data like OAuth2 secrets are stored as configuration parameters, which is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — **Reasonable.**\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on data structures and type annotations for data handling and OAuth2 configs. No executable logic or network activity.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns. Sensitive fields are in type annotations, not embedded secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — **Reasonable.**\n\n**Conclusion:** The evaluation aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Data schemas and configuration classes, including OAuth2 client info with 'id' and 'secret' fields.\n- **Findings:** The 'secret' field is part of configuration data, not hardcoded secrets. No obfuscation or malicious code. The security risk score is 0.2, which might be slightly high but still acceptable given the presence of sensitive fields.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — **Reasonable.**\n\n**Note:** The risk score is slightly elevated due to presence of 'secret' fields, but since these are configuration schemas, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Data schemas including OAuth2 token info, with sensitive fields like 'access_token' and 'secret'.\n- **Findings:** No executable code or network activity. The presence of secrets in data schemas is typical for configuration, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — **Reasonable.**\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent with the static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, defining data structures and configuration schemas, including OAuth2 secrets.\n- **Findings:** No malicious or obfuscated code. The code is purely declarative.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated in some reports due to inclusion of secrets in configuration schemas, but these are standard and not indicative of a security breach.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's static, schema-defining nature.\n- The presence of secrets in configuration classes does not constitute a security risk by itself; proper handling at runtime is necessary, but this code does not demonstrate insecure practices.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — mainly due to inclusion of secrets in configuration schemas, which is standard practice but warrants careful handling.\n\n**In conclusion, the reports' scores are appropriate and justified based on the static code review.**",
