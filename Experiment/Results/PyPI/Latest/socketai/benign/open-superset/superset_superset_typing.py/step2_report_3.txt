  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is purely structural, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Sensitive data like OAuth2 secrets are stored as plain strings in configuration objects, which is standard practice.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets beyond placeholders, no vulnerabilities evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes that the code is mainly type definitions and data models, with no runtime logic or network activity. Sensitive fields are in configuration schemas, not embedded secrets.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, standard data modeling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, mainly type definitions and configuration schemas. The report notes that sensitive fields like 'secret' are typical in configs, not embedded secrets.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or obfuscation; standard practice.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — the risk score is slightly above zero but justified as a cautious acknowledgment of potential mishandling if secrets are misused, though no actual vulnerability is present.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, no executable logic, no network activity, just data schemas. Sensitive fields are part of configuration.\n- **Assessment:** No security risk or malware. The presence of secrets in configs is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Again, purely type definitions and configuration schemas. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** No security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1–0.2), justified by the presence of sensitive fields in configuration schemas. These are standard and do not indicate vulnerabilities, but mismanagement could pose risks if secrets are mishandled at runtime.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — a minimal, conservative risk score reflecting that sensitive info is present in configs, which requires proper handling but does not constitute an inherent vulnerability.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and their scoring aligns with the static nature of the code. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, well-structured, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. Proper handling of secrets in deployment is always recommended, but that is outside the scope of this static analysis.",
