  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SQL query execution component with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or sabotage. It employs best practices for error handling, resource management, and result serialization. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0, with an obfuscated score of 0. The overall risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting operational considerations rather than malicious threats."
