      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for legacy data handling, performing safe dictionary operations without malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.

      "conclusion": "The code is a security-focused SQL parsing and manipulation library, free of malicious activity or obfuscation. Its capabilities for dynamic SQL modification could be misused if inputs are malicious, but this does not indicate malicious intent in the code itself. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified and align with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes used for error handling in the Superset project. It shows no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal potential for information leakage through error messages. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for production use."

The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal risk. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature."

      "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, security-conscious templating system for SQL query generation, employing sandboxing, validation, and strict type enforcement. While dynamic content introduces some risk of injection, the safeguards are robust, and no malicious activity or backdoors are evident. The overall security posture is low risk, with an estimated risk score around 0.3. Malware and obfuscation scores are 0, reflecting the code's transparency and lack of malicious intent."

It employs best practices for error handling, resource management, and result serialization. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0, with an obfuscated score of 0. The overall risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting operational considerations rather than malicious threats."
