{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of custom exception classes used within the Superset project for error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions, exception initializations, and localized message strings; no external input sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external system calls are present; all data used for errors are either hardcoded, class attributes, or method parameters not shown as originating from external sources.",
  "flows": "The exception classes instantiate error objects with messages and optional data; these are then raised or converted to dictionaries for reporting. There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is primarily class definitions and error handling logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external system interactions are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a structured exception hierarchy for the Superset application, including localization support and detailed error data. It strictly manages error information without any external input processing or malicious behavior. The code appears standard, clean, and aligned with typical error handling practices. No signs of malicious or sabotage code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a well-structured set of custom exceptions for error management, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or unsafe behaviors. It is safe to use from a security standpoint.",
