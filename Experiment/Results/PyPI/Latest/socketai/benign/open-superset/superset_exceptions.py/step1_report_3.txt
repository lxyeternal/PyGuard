  "purpose": "This code defines various custom exception classes for error handling in the Superset application, including mechanisms for converting exceptions to dictionary format and handling specific error scenarios.",
  "sources": "Error instantiation points within exception constructors and property accessors.",
  "sinks": "Serialization to dictionary in to_dict methods; potential external API communication if exceptions are converted and transmitted; error message construction with string formatting.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated with messages or error objects, converted to dictionaries for output or logging; no data flows from untrusted sources directly into the code, as all input appears to be controlled by calling code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code, suspicious network calls, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code solely manages error representation and propagation.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured to define exception classes for a web application, with clear constructors, property methods, and serialization functions. It relies on external error objects and parameters provided by calling code, and performs standard error handling routines. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is evident. No external system interaction occurs, and no untrusted data is directly processed or transmitted.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling within a web framework, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior; it simply structures exception data for internal and external use.",
