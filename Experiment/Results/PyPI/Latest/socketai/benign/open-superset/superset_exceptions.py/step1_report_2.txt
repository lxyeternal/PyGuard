{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of exception classes for handling various error conditions in a web application, particularly related to data processing, security, and API interactions within the Superset framework.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include exception messages, error parameters (such as SQL strings, payloads, error details), and function parameters for creating exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include error message construction, error serialization to dictionaries, and passing error details through exception objects. No unsafe data handling or external system communication is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from exception-raising inputs (messages, error details, parameters) into exception objects, which are then converted to dictionaries or messages for logging or API responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The code consists mainly of class definitions, constructors, and property methods. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of custom exception classes for error handling within a Python web application. All exception classes properly encapsulate error details and support serialization. The use of exception parameters and error objects appears standard. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network calls, or backdoors. The error messages and handling are consistent with safe practices. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for application error handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any external communications, data leaks, or unsafe operations. Overall, it appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
