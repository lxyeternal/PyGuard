{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes used in a Python application, specifically for error handling within the Superset project.",
  "sources": "Exception initialization parameters, particularly error messages and optional data passed during exception creation.",
  "sinks": "Conversion of exception data to dictionaries and potential exposure of error details through the to_dict methods, possibly including sensitive error messages or internal data.",
  "flows": "Exception objects are instantiated with specific error information, converted to dictionaries via to_dict methods, which may expose error messages and additional data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed; the code strictly defines error classes with standard practices. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious functions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive set of custom exception classes used for error handling, with properties for error type, level, message, and additional context. The classes are designed for clarity and proper error categorization. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity. The to_dict methods expose exception data in a controlled manner. The code adheres to standard error handling patterns and does not perform any suspicious actions, data leaks, or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error management in a Python application. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its structure and content are consistent with typical error handling code, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
