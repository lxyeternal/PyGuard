  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes used for error handling in the Superset project. It shows no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal potential for information leakage through error messages. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for production use."
