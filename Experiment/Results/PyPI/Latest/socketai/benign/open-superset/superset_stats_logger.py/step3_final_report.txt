  "purpose": "Logging classes for real-time metrics collection, including dummy and StatsD-based implementations.",
  "sources": "Initialization of logger classes, method calls to increment, decrement, timing, and gauge functions, and external StatsClient interactions.",
  "sinks": "Network calls to StatsClient for metrics reporting; no untrusted data processed into sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Method calls (incr, decr, timing, gauge) invoke external StatsClient methods; no data flows from untrusted sources into critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines benign metrics logging classes with standard patterns. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External dependencies are used appropriately, and error handling is standard. Network activity is typical for metrics collection and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of metrics logging utilities with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
