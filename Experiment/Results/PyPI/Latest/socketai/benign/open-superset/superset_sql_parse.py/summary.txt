  "conclusion": "The code is a security-focused SQL parsing and manipulation library, free of malicious activity or obfuscation. Its capabilities for dynamic SQL modification could be misused if inputs are malicious, but this does not indicate malicious intent in the code itself. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified and align with the analysis."
