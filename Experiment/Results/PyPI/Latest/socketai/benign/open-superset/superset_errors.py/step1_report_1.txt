{
  "purpose": "The code defines error types, issue codes, and a class for handling errors within the Superset application, mainly for logging, user messaging, and error categorization.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (dataclasses, typing) and third-party libraries (flask_babel, superset.utils.backports). No user input or external data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or security-critical actions are present. The class mainly manipulates internal data structures for error reporting.",
  "flows": "The code initializes error objects with messages and types, then augments these with issue codes and messages based on mappings. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, nor does it execute untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily consists of static definitions, mappings, and a data class. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enumerations and mappings for various error types and issue codes used within the Superset project. The SupersetError class encapsulates error information and adds contextual data based on predefined mappings. All data is static or derived from internal mappings; there are no external input points, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard error handling module, with no malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, static error management utility for the Superset project, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It does not process untrusted input, execute code dynamically, or interact with external systems in a suspicious manner.",
