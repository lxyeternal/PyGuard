  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is static, defining error types, issue codes, and a class for error handling. No external input, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation or malware signs.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, well-structured, and purely for internal error management. No malicious intent or security risk.\n\n**Score adjustments:** No changes needed. The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code is static, mapping error types to issue codes, with a data class for errors. No external data handling or suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is standard error handling logic.\n\n**Score adjustments:** Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—static definitions, mappings, and a class for errors. No external inputs, dynamic code, or malicious activity. The only potential concern is that error messages could leak internal info if exposed, but this is a typical risk in error reporting and not indicative of malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Score adjustments:** No change; scores should stay at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous analyses—static, well-structured error handling code. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No security risks or malware signs.\n\n**Score adjustments:** Scores remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above—static error definitions, mappings, and data class. No external input or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n\n**Score adjustments:** Keep at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. The code is purely for internal error management.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear, static, and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since there are no security vulnerabilities, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, static error handling module used in the Superset project. It does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or interact with external systems in a suspicious manner. No evidence suggests any supply chain security issues or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reviews and the nature of the code.",
