  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code defines error types, issue codes, and a class for internal error handling. No external input, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns. The logic is static, mapping error types to issue codes and messages, used for error reporting.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies that the code is static and safe, with no malicious behavior. The confidence is high, and the malware/security risk scores are appropriately set to 0.\n\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed. The code is safe and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code is about error definitions, mappings, and a data class for errors. No external data processing, no dynamic code, no obfuscation. It handles error classification and message formatting.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores are consistent.\n\n- **Verdict:** No modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, the code is static, defining error types, mappings, and a class for error reporting. It does not process untrusted data, execute code dynamically, or interact with external systems in a suspicious way.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; the code is standard error handling code with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on the static nature and standard error handling pattern. No suspicious patterns or malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identified as a safe, structured error reporting module.\n\n- **Verdict:** No adjustments required.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a well-structured error management system, mapping error types to issue codes and messages, with no external data input or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n- **Verdict:** No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** Static error definitions, mappings, and a data class for error reporting.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious code, no dynamic execution, no external data handling.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0; no security vulnerabilities or supply chain risks identified.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is purely for error classification and messaging within the Superset application.\n- No dynamic code execution, no external input processing, no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n- The static mappings and data structures are standard for such modules.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code appears to be a safe, standard error handling utility with no supply chain security issues.",
