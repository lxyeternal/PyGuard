  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines error types, issue codes, and a class for error handling in Superset. No external input or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- **Assessment:** The code is static, primarily involving enumerations, constants, and a data class that maps error types to issue codes/messages. The `SupersetError` class adds issue info based on internal mappings.\n- **Malware/Malicious Behavior:** None detected. No dynamic code, no external data handling, no suspicious logic.\n- **Security Risk:** None.\n- **Score justification:** The report's malware and security risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static error classification and messaging. No external data or risky operations.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic behavior. The class and mappings are static.\n- **Malware/Suspicious Activity:** Absent.\n- **Security risk:** None.\n- **Score justification:** Correctly assigned 0 for malware and security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Error types and mappings are static; no external input or execution.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward error handling utility. No dynamic code, no external data processing, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware/Suspicious Activity:** None.\n- **Security risk:** None.\n- **Score justification:** Correctly assigned zero scores.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Error definitions and mappings are static; error messages are generated from predefined constants.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior or malicious code. The code is purely for error reporting.\n- **Malware/Suspicious Activity:** Absent.\n- **Security risk:** None.\n- **Score justification:** Appropriately zero.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static error management module with mappings and data classes.\n- **Assessment:** No dynamic code, no external input handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware/Suspicious Activity:** None.\n- **Security risk:** None.\n- **Score justification:** Correctly zero.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code is static, with no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, readable nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified because the code is purely for error classification and messaging, with no external data handling or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, static code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — No security risks present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content. There are no signs of supply chain security issues, malicious activity, or obfuscation in this code snippet.",
