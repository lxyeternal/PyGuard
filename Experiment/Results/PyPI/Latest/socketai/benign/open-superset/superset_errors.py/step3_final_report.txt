{
  "purpose": "This code defines error types, issue codes, and an error handling class for the Superset application, primarily for internal error classification and messaging.",
  "sources": "The code reads internal error type enums, predefined constants, and mappings; no external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The flow involves error type identification, mapping to issue codes/messages, and augmentation of error objects with this information during instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is static, well-structured, and contains no suspicious or unusual logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static utility module for error classification within Superset, involving enums, constants, and a data class that enriches error instances with issue codes based on internal mappings. It does not process external data, execute dynamic code, or perform network/file operations. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The error handling is standard and safe, with no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static error management utility with no signs of supply chain security issues, malicious activity, or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with its static and safe nature.",
