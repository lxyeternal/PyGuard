{
  "purpose": "The code defines error types, issue codes, and an error handling class for the Superset application, primarily for categorizing and reporting errors related to database and frontend operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from predefined constants, class attributes, and error type enums. No external data input sources are used within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "The code generates error messages and attaches issue codes and messages, but does not interact with external data sinks or untrusted sources directly.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data; the flow involves internal error classification and message generation based on predefined mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. The code uses safe string literals and standard library features. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class and constant definitions for error handling within the Superset application. It maps error types to issue codes and provides a structured error class for creating error instances. No external inputs are processed, and no external data is sent or received within this snippet. The logic is static and aligns with typical error management patterns. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error handling and classification module with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated behavior. It appears to be a well-structured part of a larger system for error reporting. Therefore, it poses no security threat.",
