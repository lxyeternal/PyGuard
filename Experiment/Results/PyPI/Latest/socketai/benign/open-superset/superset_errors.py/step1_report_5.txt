{
  "purpose": "The code defines error types, issue codes, and a data structure for handling and reporting errors within the Superset application, focusing on error classification and messaging.",
  "sources": "The code reads constants, class definitions, and mappings; it also processes error instances during initialization to assign issue codes.",
  "sinks": "The error messages and extra data, including issue codes and messages, are stored and potentially returned or logged for user-facing or system purposes.",
  "flows": "Error type and message are assigned during SupersetError object instantiation, with potential flow into error reporting or logging mechanisms.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hardcoded secrets. All code appears to be standard for error handling and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation for categorizing and reporting errors, with mappings from error types to issue codes and messages. It uses dataclasses for error objects and includes a post-initialization method to attach relevant issue codes. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are present. Usage of external libraries is for type hints and internationalization, typical in web applications. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious payloads. The code is straightforward and serves a purely administrative, error-reporting purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation for error management within the Superset project. No malicious or sabotage intent is detected. It effectively maps error types to user-friendly messages and issue codes for diagnostics.",
