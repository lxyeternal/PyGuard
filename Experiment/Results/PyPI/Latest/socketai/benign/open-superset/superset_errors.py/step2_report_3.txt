  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily composed of static enumerations, constants, mappings, and a data class for error handling.\n- There are no indications of dynamic code execution, user input processing, or external data handling.\n- The code does not perform network operations, file I/O, or interact with external systems.\n- The purpose is to standardize error types, issue codes, and error reporting within the Superset project.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present.\n- The error class's post-initialization method simply augments error objects with predefined issue codes based on internal mappings.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.**\n- The code is static, well-structured, and typical for an error handling module.\n- The mappings and data are hardcoded, which is standard practice for error code definitions.\n- No external input is processed, and no external data is sent or received.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n- The mappings between error types and issue codes are consistent and comprehensive.\n- The code's design ensures error objects are enriched with relevant issue codes, which is appropriate.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — The code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — The code does not introduce any security risks; it is a static error management utility.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The only potential concern is whether exposing detailed error messages or issue codes could leak internal system details. However, the messages are standard and do not reveal sensitive information.\n- The code does not process untrusted input, so injection or code execution risks are negligible.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Aspect | Reasoning |\n|---|---|\n| **Malware** | 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected. |\n| **Obfuscated** | 0 — Code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured. |\n| **Risk** | 0 — No security vulnerabilities or attack vectors. |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, static error handling module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and appropriate for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The reports' scores seem reasonable and aligned with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis, confirming the code's safety and benign nature.",
