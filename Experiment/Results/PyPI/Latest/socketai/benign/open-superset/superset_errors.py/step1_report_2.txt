{
  "purpose": "The code defines error types, issue codes, and a class for representing and managing errors within the Superset application, mainly for error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from error_type parameters, class instantiations, and error mappings within the SupersetError class and constants.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly output or write untrusted data; it mainly formats error messages and attaches issue codes to error responses.",
  "flows": "Error type input is used to map to issue codes and generate structured error messages, which are returned as dictionaries. No external data flow or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The code primarily involves static definitions, data mappings, and a simple class for error reporting. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes enumerations for different error types and levels, maps error types to issue codes and messages, and implements a data class for creating error objects that include these mappings. It ensures error messages are consistent and detailed, but it does not perform any risky operations such as network access, data exfiltration, or code injection. All data handling appears static and safe. The only dynamic behavior is the updating of the 'extra' field in the SupersetError class, which is based on predefined mappings. This is standard error handling logic with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely concerned with structured error management and does not contain any malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It is well-structured, static, and safe.",
