{
  "purpose": "The code provides core package functions for the Arsla programming language, including execution, version info, and module imports.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via the 'execute' function argument 'code'. It also imports modules from the current package: errors, lexer, parser, interpreter.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the 'execute' function, which processes input code through tokenize, parse, and run methods, potentially executing user-provided code.",
  "flows": "Input 'code' flows from the 'execute' function into 'tokenize', then into 'parse', and finally into 'interpreter.run'. The interpreter's run method executes code, possibly affecting system state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs. No network, file system, or system info access appears in this module.",
  "analysis": "The module primarily orchestrates the execution flow for a language interpreter. It imports components, defines a simple API, and runs code via 'interpreter.run'. The 'execute' function processes user input safely within the interpreter context, assuming the imported components are secure. There are no suspicious data leaks, external network connections, or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward and standard for a language execution package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious wrapper for executing Arsla language code. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears safe based on this fragment.",
