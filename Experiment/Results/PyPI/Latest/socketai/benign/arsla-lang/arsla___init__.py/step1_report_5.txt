{
  "purpose": "This package implements a core interpreter for the Arsla programming language, providing functions to execute code, parse, tokenize, and manage errors.",
  "sources": "Code reads input through the 'execute' function argument 'code', and internal imports from relative modules (errors, lexer, parser, interpreter).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data; the primary sink is the 'interpreter.run' method which executes parsed tokens, but no external data transmission or harmful actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'code' is tokenized, parsed, and then executed by the Interpreter; data flows from 'code' to 'tokenize', then to 'parse', and finally to 'interpreter.run'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and typical for a language interpreter core.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal core for an interpreter package, importing modules for errors, tokenization, parsing, and execution. It provides an 'execute' function that tokenizes, parses, and runs the code via the Interpreter object, returning the final stack state. The code appears clean, with no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The package's only potential security concern could relate to the 'interpreter.run' method, but based solely on this code snippet, no malicious intent is detectable.",
  "conclusion": "This package appears to be a legitimate implementation of a language interpreter core. It does not contain any malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks within the provided code. The overall security risk is very low, with no malware detected.",
