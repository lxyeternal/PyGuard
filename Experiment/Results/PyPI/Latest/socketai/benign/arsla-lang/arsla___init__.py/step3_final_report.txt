  "purpose": "A core package implementing the Arsla programming language, providing functions to tokenize, parse, and execute Arsla code via an interpreter.",
  "sources": "The 'execute' function reads user-provided code as a string input.",
  "sinks": "The code passes tokenized and parsed data to the Interpreter's run method; potential untrusted data flow depends on the interpreter implementation.",
  "flows": "Input code -> tokenize() -> parse() -> interpreter.run() -> final stack",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper that imports modules for error handling, lexing, parsing, and interpreting. The 'execute' function processes user code through tokenization, parsing, and execution, returning the final stack. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. Security concerns depend on the implementation of the imported modules, especially 'Interpreter.run', which is outside this snippet. The code does not perform network operations, file I/O, or system modifications. The risk of malicious activity arises if the interpreter executes malicious code, but this is external to this module. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated score as 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the inherent risk of executing untrusted code but minimal within this wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured wrapper for executing Arsla code. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The primary risk is external, depending on the interpreter's implementation, but within this module, the risk is minimal.",
