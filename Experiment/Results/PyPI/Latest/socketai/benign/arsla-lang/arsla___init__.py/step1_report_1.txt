{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a core package for the Arsla programming language, providing functions to execute Arsla code, manage version info, and expose key modules and classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.errors, .lexer, .parser, .interpreter) and the input parameter 'code' in execute()",
  "sinks": "The execute() function processes input code and runs it through the interpreter; no direct sinks for untrusted data are evident",
  "flows": "Input code flows from the 'code' parameter into tokenize(), then parse(), then run() on Interpreter; no external data flows are present",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution found",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package wrapper that initializes an interpreter, processes input code through tokenize and parse functions, and executes it. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The only input source is user-provided code string, which is processed internally without external data sinks. The imports are standard, and there is no suspicious handling of environment variables or system data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign core module for a programming language interpreter, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It simply orchestrates existing components to run Arsla code safely.",
