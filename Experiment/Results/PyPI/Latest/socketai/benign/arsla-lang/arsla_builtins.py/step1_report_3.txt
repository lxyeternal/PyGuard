{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of stack manipulation and arithmetic functions, likely part of a stack-based calculator or interpreter system.",
  "sources": "Code imports standard libraries (math, typing) and internal errors; no external input sources or network operations are present.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no output or external data is sent outside the printed results, and no untrusted data is explicitly processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve stack operations where elements are pushed, popped, or transformed within functions; no external data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears straightforward and typical for a stack-based calculator implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines basic stack operations, arithmetic, comparison, and utility functions. It includes proper error handling via custom exceptions. No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscated code are detected. The functions operate on the stack with well-defined input/output behaviors. The import of internal error classes does not introduce any malicious behavior. There are no network operations, file manipulations, or external system calls. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of a stack-based calculation system with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of stack operations and arithmetic functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is clean, well-structured, and lacks any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
