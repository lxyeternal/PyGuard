{
  "purpose": "This code provides stack manipulation, arithmetic, comparison, and utility functions for a scripting environment, likely used for a stack-based language or calculator.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from the 'stack' parameter passed into each function. It also imports 'math' and some custom errors from '.errors'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'print' statement in 'print_top', which outputs to standard output, and the 'math.factorial' function, which is safe. No external network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input stack through operations like addition, subtraction, etc., with results stored back on the stack. No external untrusted data sources or data leaks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code appears straightforward, with standard implementations of arithmetic and stack operations. The only notable feature is the 'next_prime' function, which calculates prime numbers dynamically but contains no malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of stack operations and math functions, with standard error handling. It does not contain obfuscated code or suspicious patterns. The 'print_top' function outputs data, but this is typical for debugging or interactive use. There are no network calls, file manipulations, or hidden behaviors. Overall, the code appears safe and well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign set of stack and math utilities intended for a scripting environment. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. It is safe for inclusion in larger projects.",
