  "purpose": "Implementation of stack manipulation, arithmetic, comparison, and utility functions for a scripting or calculator environment.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'stack' parameter; 'print_top' outputs data to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via 'print' and 'print_top' functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows internally within the 'stack'; 'print' functions output the top element, potentially leaking data if misused.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of stack and math operations with proper error handling. It operates solely on the provided 'stack' parameter, with no external data sources or network activity. The 'print' functions are typical for debugging or user feedback and do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The functions are safe and benign, with the only minor consideration being the potential data leakage via 'print', which is common in such utility code but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of stack and arithmetic functions with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk associated with data leakage through 'print' is typical and not indicative of malicious activity.",
