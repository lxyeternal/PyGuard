{
  "purpose": "Define a structured hierarchy of exception classes for handling errors in the Arsla programming language, including lexer, parser, runtime, and specific error types.",
  "sources": "Importing Token from a relative lexer module; exception initialization with message, position, token, stack state, and operation parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the exception classes contain data sinks or untrusted data flows; no external system interaction or data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "flows": "Error objects are created with input parameters; no flow of untrusted data to external systems, network, or files is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. Exception class design is standard, with clear, descriptive messages.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for a language interpreter/compiler. It uses standard Python features, including inheritance, optional parameters, and string representations. No indications of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, backdoors, code injection, or obfuscated constructs. The code is purely structural for error handling. No external network or file operations, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for handling language errors. No malicious intent or security risks are detected. The code appears safe and intended solely for error management.",
