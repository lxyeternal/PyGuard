{
  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling errors in the Arsla programming language, including lexical, parsing, runtime, stack, math, and block errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' and '.lexer', and class definitions that handle error information.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks such as network or filesystem.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; error classes are for exception handling and do not process external data streams.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected; the code follows standard exception class definitions with no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a structured hierarchy of exception classes designed for error handling in a language implementation. It imports type annotations and a 'Token' class, which suggests integration with a lexer component. All classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, with custom attributes to store contextual information like message, stack state, operation, and token details. The constructors and __str__ methods are straightforward, focusing on providing detailed error descriptions. No dynamic code execution, network access, or credential handling is present. The code appears to be a well-structured, typical error class hierarchy with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions for a language runtime, with no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no obfuscated code. It does not pose any security risks and appears safe for use.",
