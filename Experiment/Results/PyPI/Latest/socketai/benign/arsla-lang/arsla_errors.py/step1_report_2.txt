{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling errors in the Arsla programming language, including lexical, parsing, runtime, stack, math, and block errors.",
  "sources": "Imports 'Optional', 'Dict', 'Any' from 'typing' and 'Token' from a local lexer module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not handle untrusted input data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of error objects with messages and contextual data; raising exceptions during language processing or execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for defining exception hierarchies; no unusual or suspicious behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a structured exception hierarchy for a language interpreter/compiler, with methods to include contextual information such as positions, tokens, and stack states. Exception messages are formatted with relevant details. The imports are standard; no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. No anomalies or malicious constructs identified. The code's purpose is error handling, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured exception class hierarchy for error management in a language runtime, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
