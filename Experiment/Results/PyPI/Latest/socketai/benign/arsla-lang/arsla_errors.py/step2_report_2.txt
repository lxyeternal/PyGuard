  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, well-structured hierarchy of exception classes for an interpreter/compiler.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is claimed or implied.\n- The code involves typical patterns for error handling, with contextual information like token data, stack state, and operation names.\n- The imports and class structures are standard, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- The code does not process untrusted data beyond error reporting.\n- No network, file, or system commands are involved.\n- No dynamic code execution or code injection patterns are present.\n- The use of `Token` from a local module is consistent with language parser implementations.\n- Exception messages are descriptive and include relevant context.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, justified because the code does not pose any security threat or vulnerability.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- The reports are consistent and do not overstate or understate the security implications.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly identifies the code as purely structural error handling.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a typical exception hierarchy for a language interpreter/compiler.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, standard, and safe. The reports' assessments are accurate and comprehensive. No changes are necessary.",
