{
  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of exception classes for handling various errors in the Arsla programming language interpreter or compiler.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .lexer import Token; exception class initializers and string representations",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling, no network or system commands",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; exception classes primarily process messages and optional context or tokens",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code structure is straightforward, and no suspicious code patterns or obfuscated elements are present",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for different error types, inheriting from Python's Exception base class. It includes detailed error messages and optional contextual information. The exception classes are well-structured for use in a language interpreter, providing descriptive error reporting. The import of 'Token' from a local lexer module appears standard for a language parsing system. No dynamic code execution, system calls, network operations, or credential handling are present. The code does not include any obfuscated patterns or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling within a language processing system. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is safe and focused on error reporting.",
