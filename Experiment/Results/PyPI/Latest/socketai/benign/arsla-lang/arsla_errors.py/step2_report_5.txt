  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided, the code's behavior, and the potential security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for an Arsla language interpreter/compiler.\n- It uses standard Python exception inheritance.\n- Exception classes include contextual info such as messages, token data, stack states, and operations.\n- The code imports 'Token' from a local lexer module, which is typical for language parsers.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data is present.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The classes are correctly structured for error reporting. The constructors and string representations are consistent.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; the code is purely for error handling.\n\n### Logical flaws or anomalies:\n- The only minor point is that `ArslaRuntimeError` accepts a `stack_state` list and copies it into the context. This is acceptable and standard.\n- The use of `token._asdict()` assumes that `Token` has an `_asdict()` method, which is typical if `Token` is a namedtuple or similar. If `Token` lacks this method, it could cause an error, but this is outside the scope of the exception classes themselves and likely handled elsewhere.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5; given the absence of any malicious or risky behavior, a score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Justification:\n- Since the code is solely for error handling, with no external system interaction, data exfiltration, or code injection, the security risk remains negligible.\n- The detailed context information in exceptions is standard practice and does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis provided in each report.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\nThe code is a well-structured, standard exception hierarchy for a language interpreter/compiler. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a risk score of zero.\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores based on this analysis:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's benign nature and its purpose solely for structured error reporting.",
