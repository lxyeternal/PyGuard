  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code defines a structured hierarchy of exception classes for the Arsla language, covering lexical, parsing, runtime, stack, math, and block errors.\n   - The classes are straightforward, inheriting from Python's Exception, with contextual data stored and formatted for debugging.\n   - The import of `Token` from a local module is standard for language parsers.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies**:\n   - No report indicates any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present.\n   - The exception classes serve purely for error reporting and debugging.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the analysis; no malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n   - The high confidence scores (mostly 1) are justified.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies & Recommendations**:\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment.\n   - Since the code is purely structural for error handling, no changes to the scores are necessary.\n   - The detailed context information (stack state, token details, operation) enhances debugging but does not introduce security concerns.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured exception hierarchy for a language interpreter/compiler. It is free from malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' evaluations are accurate and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nI agree with the provided scores. No adjustments are needed. The code is safe, clear, and serves its purpose for error handling without any security concerns.",
