  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Behavior**:\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for the Arsla language, covering lexical, parsing, runtime, stack, math, and block errors.\n   - It uses standard Python exception inheritance, with constructors that accept messages and contextual data such as positions, tokens, stack states, and operations.\n   - The code appears to be purely for error reporting and debugging, with no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.\n   - The import of `Token` from a local module is typical for language parsers.\n   - The class structures and methods are straightforward, focusing on structured error reporting.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All five reports consistently conclude that the code is a standard, well-structured exception hierarchy.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are identified.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, and the malware and obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Scores Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score (0)**: No malicious behavior, code injection, or harmful activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: The code is clear, with no obfuscation techniques.\n   - **Risk Score (~0.0 - 0.1)**: Since the code is purely for error handling, the security risk is negligible.\n\n5. **Any Potential Concerns or Assumptions?**:\n   - The code itself does not handle untrusted data or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n   - The only external component is the `Token` class, which is standard in language parsing contexts.\n   - No evidence suggests any malicious intent or security vulnerability.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of an exception hierarchy for a language interpreter/compiler.\n- It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Recommended Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.1 (very low, as error handling code generally carries minimal risk)\n\n**Summary**:\nThis code is benign, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
