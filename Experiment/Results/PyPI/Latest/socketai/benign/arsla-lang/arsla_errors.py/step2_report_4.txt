  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code is a standard exception hierarchy for an interpreter/compiler.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are mentioned or implied.\n- The code relies on typical Python exception patterns, with contextual information stored and formatted for debugging.\n- No external system interactions, network activity, or handling of untrusted data that could pose security issues are present.\n- The import of `Token` from a local module is typical for language parsing systems.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not contain any signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- All reports agree that the purpose is error reporting and debugging support, with no indication of security vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n**Scores and justification:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0. Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or risky patterns, this is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical, well-structured exception hierarchy for a language interpreter or compiler.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious elements are present.\n- The scoring aligns with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and appropriate for its purpose.\n- No further security concerns are warranted based on the provided code.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. The code is benign and does not pose security risks.",
