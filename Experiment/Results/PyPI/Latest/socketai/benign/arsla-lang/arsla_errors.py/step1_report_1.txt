{
  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling in the Arsla programming language interpreter or compiler.",
  "sources": "import statements from 'typing' and '.lexer'; exception class constructors, particularly where they process input parameters such as message, position, token, stack_state, etc.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Construction of exception objects with messages and optional context data, including token data, stack states, operation names, and error-specific details.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior. All class definitions are straightforward, primarily for error reporting. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a structured exception hierarchy for error handling in the Arsla language, including lexical, parsing, runtime, stack, math, and block errors. It uses standard Python exception patterns with contextual information, such as error messages and state data. The use of 'Token' from a local module is typical for language parsers. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or malicious behavior. The code appears to serve purely for structured error reporting and debugging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error class hierarchy for a language interpreter or compiler. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. All components are consistent with normal error handling patterns. No malware, malicious code, or security issues are detected.",
