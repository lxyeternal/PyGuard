{
  "purpose": "Parse a list of tokens into a nested AST structure with proper block handling and error detection.",
  "sources": "Tokens read during iteration in parse(), token values used in stack appending, token types checked for block delimiters, token values used in flatten_block() for reconstructing tokens.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or system calls; token values are only processed in-memory and used to generate new tokens.",
  "flows": "Tokens are read from input, block delimiters modify the stack structure, token values are appended to current block, flatten_block() reconstructs tokens from nested structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; standard parsing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard token parser with block management, error handling for mismatched blocks, and a straightforward flattening function. It does not perform external communication, execute untrusted code, or handle secrets. The only potential concern is the use of token values in flatten_block(), which could be exploited if tokens are maliciously crafted, but this is typical in parsers and does not constitute malicious behavior. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard parser module with no malicious intent or security risks. The minimal security concern related to token values during flattening is theoretical and does not translate into actual harm. Therefore, malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0, reflecting negligible risk.",
