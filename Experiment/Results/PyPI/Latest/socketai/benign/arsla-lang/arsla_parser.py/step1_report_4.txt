{
  "purpose": "Parse token streams into nested AST structures with block handling and provide a way to flatten these structures back into tokens.",
  "sources": "Tokens provided as input to the parse() function, specifically token.type and token.value; tokens from lexer.tokenize()",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is written to external systems or files, no network operations, no system commands executed",
  "flows": "Tokens are processed sequentially in parse() to build nested structures; flatten_block() reads nested structures to produce token list",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic execution or external calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard parsing of token streams into nested list structures and provides a method to reverse this process. It uses a stack to handle nested blocks, raising errors on mismatched block delimiters. The code includes type-based token reconstruction for flattening. No external network, file, or system modification operations are present. It appears to be a straightforward parser implementation with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard parsing utility with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or supply chain threats. It is safe based on the analysis.",
