{
  "purpose": "To parse token streams into abstract syntax trees (ASTs) for the Arsla language and convert nested blocks back into linear token sequences.",
  "sources": "Input tokens from the lexer.tokenize() function, specifically token.type and token.value.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to output untrusted data or interact with external systems directly; it primarily processes in-memory data structures.",
  "flows": "Tokens are read from input, processed to build nested structures (source), and may be flattened back into tokens (sink) for debugging or further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present. The code performs standard parsing operations with error checks for unmatched blocks.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly manages nested block structures with a stack, raising errors for mismatched or unclosed blocks. The flattening function reconstructs tokens from nested structures, following expected patterns. No suspicious behaviors, external system interactions, or data leaks are detected. The functions serve typical parsing and serialization purposes without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward parser and serializer for a simple language syntax. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
