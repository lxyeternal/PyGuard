  "purpose": "CLI interface for the Arsla language, supporting file execution, REPL, documentation, and debugging.",
  "sources": "Reading source files (.ah), user input via console.input(), subprocess for building docs, webbrowser for opening local HTML files.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() for building documentation, webbrowser.open() for opening local files, console.input() for user input.",
  "flows": "File reading -> tokenization -> parsing -> interpretation; user input -> tokenization -> parsing -> interpretation; subprocess call for docs; webbrowser opening local file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code; standard use of subprocess and webbrowser; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for a language interpreter, with standard modules and patterns. It reads files, processes user input, invokes external commands for documentation, and opens local HTML files. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain risks are evident. External calls are used in typical, controlled contexts. Error handling is standard. The modules imported are local and not shown, but based on usage, they appear normal. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI interface for the Arsla language, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated content. External calls are standard and do not pose security threats. The overall security risk is minimal.",
