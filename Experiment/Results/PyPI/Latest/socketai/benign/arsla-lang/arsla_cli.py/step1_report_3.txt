{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for the Arsla Code Golf Language, allowing users to run programs, start a REPL, and view documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads input files (.ah files), user input in REPL, command-line arguments, and environment variables for system info (e.g., sys.executable).",
  "sinks": "Calls external processes (subprocess.run), opens web browser, reads files, outputs to console, and uses sys.exit.",
  "flows": "Input files and user commands flow into code execution functions, with subprocess and webbrowser being external sinks; error handling flows output back to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No suspicious external connections or data exfiltration activities present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a CLI front-end that handles user commands, file reading, process invocation, and documentation access. It imports from local modules (.lexer, .parser, etc.) which are not shown, but the visible logic appears standard and benign. No signs of malicious payloads, data leaks, or backdoors are present. Use of subprocess.run for documentation build and webbrowser.open are typical actions. The code manages user input and error handling securely without unsafe code patterns or obfuscated features.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a command-line interface for a programming language runtime and does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It performs typical operations such as file handling, process invocation, and user interaction with no suspicious activities detected.",
