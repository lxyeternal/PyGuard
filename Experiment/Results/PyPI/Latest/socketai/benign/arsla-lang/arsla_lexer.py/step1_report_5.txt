{
  "purpose": "The code defines a lexer for the Arsla programming language, converting source code into tokens for further parsing or interpretation.",
  "sources": "Input source code string passed to the tokenize() function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily processes text input without writing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Input string -> Lexing process (character-by-character) -> Token list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The use of regex for number parsing is standard. No external data or network operations are present. The code handles escape sequences correctly and raises errors for unterminated strings, which is appropriate for lexer behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script implements a standard lexical analysis for a custom language, recognizing whitespace, strings, numbers, symbols, and block delimiters. It performs input validation and error handling for malformed strings. There are no signs of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, network communication, or code injection. The usage of regular expressions and token structures are typical for lexers. The code does not invoke any external systems or perform unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward lexer implementation for the Arsla language without malicious intent. It safely tokenizes source code and handles common lexing errors properly. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
