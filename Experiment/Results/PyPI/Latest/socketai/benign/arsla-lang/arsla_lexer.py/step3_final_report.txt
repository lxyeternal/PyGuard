{
  "purpose": "A lexer for the Arsla programming language, tokenizing strings, numbers, symbols, and blocks.",
  "sources": "Input source code string to be tokenized.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or handle untrusted data beyond tokenization.",
  "flows": "Reads characters from input, processes strings, numbers, symbols, and block delimiters, and outputs tokens.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard escape sequence handling, regex for number parsing, and explicit error handling for unterminated strings and invalid numbers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward lexer implementation. It correctly handles string escape sequences, uses regex for number detection, recognizes symbols, and manages block delimiters. Error handling is appropriate, raising exceptions for unterminated strings and invalid number formats. No external I/O, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's structure is clear, and no obfuscation or malicious code is evident. The security implications are minimal, as the lexer does not perform unsafe operations or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard lexer with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate, and their scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
