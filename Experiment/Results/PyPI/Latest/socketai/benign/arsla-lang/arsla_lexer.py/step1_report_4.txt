{
  "purpose": "The source code implements a tokenizer (lexer) for a custom scripting language called Arsla, converting source code into tokens for further parsing or interpretation.",
  "sources": "Input source code string provided to the tokenize() function.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data output mechanisms; the code mainly produces a list of tokens from input.",
  "flows": "Input code -> Tokenization process (handling strings, numbers, symbols, blocks) -> List of tokens.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code uses regex for number parsing and standard string handling with escape sequences. No network, file I/O, or environment variable usage observed. No obfuscation or malicious data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs lexical analysis, scanning input for strings, numbers, symbols, and block delimiters. It uses regex for number matching, handles escape sequences in strings, and raises errors for unterminated strings or invalid characters. No external network, system calls, or suspicious patterns are present. All operations are typical for a lexer and do not exhibit malicious intent. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a tokenizer with no evident malicious or sabotage components.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard lexical tokenizer for a custom language, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It reads input and produces tokens without engaging in harmful activities or leaking data.",
