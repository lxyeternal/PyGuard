{
  "purpose": "The source code implements a lexer (tokenizer) for a custom language called Arsla, converting source code into tokens for further parsing.",
  "sources": "Input is the 'code' string argument to the 'tokenize' function, which is the source code to be tokenized.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that send data to external systems, network, or write files. It processes input locally and generates tokens.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves reading characters from the input string, processing them into tokens (strings, numbers, symbols, blocks), with no external data or outputs beyond returning the token list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code performs standard lexing functions, with proper string escape handling and number parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lexer with clear functions for tokenizing source code into tokens of types STRING, NUMBER, SYMBOL, BLOCK_START, BLOCK_END. It includes error handling for unterminated strings and invalid numbers. The use of regex for number parsing and character-by-character processing is standard. No indications of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, remote communication, or backdoors, are present. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard lexical analyzer for a custom language, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely processes source code into tokens for further parsing. Overall, it has a low security concern profile.",
