  "purpose": "A stack-based interpreter processing tokens, literals, and commands with external 'BUILTINS'.",
  "sources": "Input AST nodes including tokens, strings, numbers, and lists.",
  "sinks": "Command execution via 'BUILTINS', stack manipulations, error handling.",
  "flows": "AST nodes -> command lookup -> command execution -> stack operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a stack-based interpreter. It loads commands from an external 'BUILTINS' dictionary, processes various AST node types, and handles control flow with 'while' and 'ternary' constructs. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The main external risk stems from 'BUILTINS', which could be malicious if compromised, but this is outside the scope of this code review. Error handling is appropriate, and the code structure is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is external dependency on 'BUILTINS', which could introduce risk if malicious. Scores are consistent: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.",
