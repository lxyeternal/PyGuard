  "purpose": "This code provides a schema validation framework for JSON data, including loading schemas from files, validating data against schemas, and enforcing snake_case naming conventions.",
  "sources": "File system (loading schema files, JSONLines, JSON samples), user-provided data samples",
  "sinks": "Validation functions that process loaded data, potential console output for errors",
  "flows": "Reading schema files and samples from disk -> Loading into JSON structures -> Validating data and key naming conventions -> Logging validation errors",
  "anomalies": "Use of `print()` statements for error reporting; no external network communication, no dynamic code execution, no use of eval or similar functions. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious variable names. No obfuscated or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file handling, JSON schema validation, and recursive validation of data keys for snake_case compliance. The class methods load schemas and samples from disk, validate data, and report errors via print statements. No suspicious data flows, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The validation process is straightforward, with no evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. The only notable behavior is logging errors to stdout, which is benign. The overall structure appears standard and secure, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a schema validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not include any network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The only potential concern is the use of print statements for error reporting, which could be improved with proper logging, but this is not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears safe and trustworthy.",
