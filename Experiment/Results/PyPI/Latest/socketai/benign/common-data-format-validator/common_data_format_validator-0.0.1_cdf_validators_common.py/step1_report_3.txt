{
  "purpose": "This code provides a schema validation framework for JSON data, including loading schemas, validating samples, and enforcing snake_case naming conventions.",
  "sources": "Reading schema files from paths, reading sample data from JSON or JSONLines files, and input data during validation (via sample parameter).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or execute system commands; errors are printed to console.",
  "flows": "Schema files are loaded from disk, samples are loaded from disk, then data is validated via jsonschema. Validation errors are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements schema validation with support for JSON and JSONLines files, custom validation, and recursive key validation. It performs file existence checks, schema loading, and validation using jsonschema. The validation logic includes checking for snake_case naming conventions, with optional custom validators for specific keys. No code appears to perform malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code execution. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward and adheres to standard validation procedures, with proper exception handling for file operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured validation utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe based on the provided code fragment.",
