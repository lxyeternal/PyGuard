  "purpose": "A schema validation utility that loads JSON schemas and samples from files, validates data against the schemas, and enforces snake_case naming conventions for keys and string values.",
  "sources": "File reads for schemas and samples, data loaded into memory for validation",
  "sinks": "Validation errors printed to standard output (print statements)",
  "flows": "Data loaded from files → validated against schemas → validation errors logged",
  "anomalies": "Use of print() for error reporting; no suspicious code or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward JSON schema validation utility with recursive validation of data structures, snake_case enforcement, and optional custom validators. It uses standard libraries and external validators without any network or system modification. No obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are present. Error reporting via print() is typical but could be improved with logging. The external 'validate_formation' validator is not suspicious by itself. Overall, the code is safe, clear, and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard validation utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor risk score due to print statements is acceptable and does not indicate malicious intent.",
