{
  "purpose": "The code is a pytest-based test suite that validates various schema files related to the 'cdf' package, ensuring correctness of schema validation functions with sample data.",
  "sources": "The code reads sample schema files from the filesystem, constructing file paths dynamically based on version variables and the __file__ location.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data sinks or transmissions; validation functions operate on local files only.",
  "flows": "Sample file paths are generated and passed directly to validation methods; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected. The use of dynamic versioning in filenames is standard in testing environments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite that imports schema validators, constructs file paths based on version variables, and runs validation on sample files, including tests for both success and failure. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or process untrusted input beyond reading local files. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The structure and logic are typical for testing schema validation in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing suite for schema validation with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
