{
  "purpose": "Defines version information and a schema path, imports validation classes for schema validation.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and the creation of a Path object; import statements for modules and classes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets constants and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version constants and a file path for schemas, then imports various validator classes. There are no input reads, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network or system calls. The Path object is constructed from static strings, which is safe. Import statements are typical for modular Python packages. Overall, the code appears to be part of a larger validation framework without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a Python package, defining constants, paths, and importing classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
