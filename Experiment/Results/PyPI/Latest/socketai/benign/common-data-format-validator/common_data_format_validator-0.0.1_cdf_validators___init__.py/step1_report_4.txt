{
  "purpose": "Define version information and schema path, and import schema validation modules for use in a larger package.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string values for version identifiers and a file path, and imports modules from relative package structure.",
  "targets": "No direct data outputs or external connections; no input sources or data sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and sets constants; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets beyond version strings, or suspicious behavior are present. The Path() usage is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version variables and a file path using pathlib.Path, then imports specific modules from within the package. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are evident. The imports and constants appear standard for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package initialization code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious activity.",
