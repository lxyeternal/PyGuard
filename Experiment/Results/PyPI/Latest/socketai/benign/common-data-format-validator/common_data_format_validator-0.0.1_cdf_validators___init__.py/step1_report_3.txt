{
  "purpose": "Define version information and a file path for schema storage, and import various schema validator classes for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded version strings and constructs a Path object for schema directory. It imports modules from the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets constants and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets beyond version strings. The Path construction appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version variables and constructs a static Path object pointing to a schema directory. It imports several classes from local modules. There is no dynamic execution, user input, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, primarily setting constants and importing modules with no suspicious behavior. It appears safe and typical for a package setup.",
