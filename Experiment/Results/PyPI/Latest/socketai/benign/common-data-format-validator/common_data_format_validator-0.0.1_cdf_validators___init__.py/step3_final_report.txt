  "purpose": "Define version variables, set schema path, and import validation classes for package setup.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings, Path constructor with static strings, local module imports.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static variable definitions, a Path object creation with fixed strings, and local imports. There are no dynamic behaviors, user inputs, network activities, or obfuscated constructs. The code is typical for package initialization, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard setup code for a Python package, with no malicious or security risks detected. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
