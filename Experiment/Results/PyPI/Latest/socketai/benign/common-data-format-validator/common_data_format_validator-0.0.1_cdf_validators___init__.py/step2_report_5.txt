  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is standard, defining version variables and a schema path, with no untrusted data, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues. The report's assessment appears accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with standard static strings and imports, no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—static version strings, Path object, local imports, no dynamic or suspicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard package setup code with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous, straightforward constants and imports, no anomalies.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is just setting version info, defining a Path, and importing local modules.\n- **Malware risk:** None of the reports identify any malicious behavior. The code does not perform any network, file system, or cryptographic operations that could be malicious.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques observed.\n- **Security risk:** The code is static, with no input handling or external data interaction.\n\n### Final scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The scores assigned in all reports seem reasonable.\n- No assumptions are made beyond what the code shows.\n- The code appears to be a standard module setup, typical in Python packages, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and well within safe boundaries. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
