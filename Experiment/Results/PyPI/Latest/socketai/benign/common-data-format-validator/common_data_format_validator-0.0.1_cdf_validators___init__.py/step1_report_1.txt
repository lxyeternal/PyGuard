  "purpose": "Define version variables and set a schema path for validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version variables, and a Path object for schema directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code mainly sets constants and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. Path usage is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and local modules, sets version strings, and defines a file path using pathlib. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs. The import statements and constants are standard for package setup. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard initialization module defining version info and schema path references. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
