  "purpose": "Define version information and a path constant, and import schema validation classes for a package module.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions (__cdf_version__, __version__, SCHEMA_PATH); import statements for local modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of constants and import statements; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code activities.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version strings and a filesystem path using pathlib.Path, then imports several schema validator classes from local modules. There is no user input handling, no network activity, no cryptographic operations, and no suspicious behavior. The structure appears standard for a Python package module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module setup with versioning, path constants, and local imports. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected based on this code snippet.",
