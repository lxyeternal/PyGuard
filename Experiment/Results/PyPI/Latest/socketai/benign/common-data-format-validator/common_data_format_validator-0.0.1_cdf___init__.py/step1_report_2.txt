  "purpose": "Import various validator classes and constants from a local module named 'validators'.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module 'validators'.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or output actions; purely import statements.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow, as this is an import statement only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code simply imports specific classes and constants without any suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a local module, importing several validator classes and constants. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The imported entities appear to be schema validators and version identifiers, which are typical in well-structured codebases. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious code constructs is present. The code is straightforward and standard for modular Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement block with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply prepares the module by importing necessary validators and constants.",
