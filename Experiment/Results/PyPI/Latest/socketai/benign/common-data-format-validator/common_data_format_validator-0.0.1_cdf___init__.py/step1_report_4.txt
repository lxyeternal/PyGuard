{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes, constants, and version information from a local module named 'validators'.",
  "sources": "Imports are sourced from a relative module within the package, specifically from the 'validators' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data might be leaked.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to sensitive sinks is apparent; the code only imports components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious constructs, or unusual code behaviors are present. The use of relative imports is standard within a package.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of classes and constants from a local module. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data processing that could indicate malicious activity. The presence of version information suggests maintenance or compatibility checks but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign import statement for organizational and versioning purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
