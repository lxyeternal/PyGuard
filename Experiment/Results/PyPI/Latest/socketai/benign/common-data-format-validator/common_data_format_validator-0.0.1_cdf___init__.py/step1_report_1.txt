  "purpose": "Import specific classes, variables, and constants from a local module named 'validators'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module file 'validators'.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling is present; the code only imports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple validator classes and constants from a relative module. No data processing, user input, or network activity is involved. The imported symbols include validator classes and schema/version constants. There are no suspicious or malicious elements in the import statement itself. The module appears to be part of a larger project, likely for schema validation or configuration. No indications of malicious intent or security risks are found in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely performs a standard import of classes and constants from a local module, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a straightforward part of a larger codebase without any malicious or suspicious elements.",
