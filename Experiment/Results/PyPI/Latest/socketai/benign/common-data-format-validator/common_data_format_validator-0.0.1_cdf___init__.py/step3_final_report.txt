  "purpose": "Import schema validators and version constants from a local module for use in validation and version tracking.",
  "sources": "Local module 'validators' from which classes and constants are imported.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports components.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data movement; static import statements only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement that brings in validator classes and version constants from a local module. There are no data flows, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns. The import is standard and benign. All scores reflect the benign nature: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, security risk score 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
