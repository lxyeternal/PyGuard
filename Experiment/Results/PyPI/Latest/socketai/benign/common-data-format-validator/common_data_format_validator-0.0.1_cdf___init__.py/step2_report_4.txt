  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward import statement with no data flow, sinks, or anomalies.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors or logical flaws detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis. Security risk is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The report's conclusion is justified; no malicious activity or obfuscation is present.\n- **Overall:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Correctly notes that the code is just import statements, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors or suspicious reasoning.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is low (0.1), which is acceptable given the benign context.\n- **Justification:** The minimal security risk score is reasonable, given no malicious behavior.\n- **Overall:** Sound assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, the code is only import statements; no data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The report's conclusion is justified.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** The analysis correctly states that the code is a simple import, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors or flaws.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0, matching the benign assessment.\n- **Justification:** The conclusion is appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others, a straightforward import statement.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Justification:** The assessment is justified.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final critical review:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is only importing classes and constants from a local module, with no data processing, network activity, or malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation, with one report assigning 0.1, but given the context, a score of 0 or 0.1 is reasonable. The minimal risk score reflects no actual security issues.\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. They correctly interpret the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard import statement with no security issues.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current assessment is accurate; no changes necessary.",
