  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is a straightforward import statement, importing classes and constants from a local module. No data flow, no untrusted input, no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None. The reasoning is accurate; the import is benign.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  - malware: 0 — correct, no malicious activity.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — correct, code is clear.\n  - securityRisk: 0 — appropriate, no security issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. Similar to Report 1, it's a simple import with no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  None. The analysis is consistent.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  - malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - securityRisk: 0.1 — slightly elevated but justified given the import of version info, which could be sensitive if misused, but in this context, it's benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. Again, just an import statement.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  None. The reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  - malware: 0 — correct.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - securityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The import is standard, no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  None. The analysis is accurate.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  - malware: 0 — correct.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - securityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The import is straightforward.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  None. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  - malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - securityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0 or very low, reflecting minimal or no security risk.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe import statements are standard, benign, and do not pose security threats. The scores assigned in each report are reasonable and consistent with the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is a normal import statement with no security concerns.",
