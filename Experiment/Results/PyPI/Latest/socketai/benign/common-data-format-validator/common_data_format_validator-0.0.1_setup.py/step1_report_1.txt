  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'common-data-format-validator' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing package version from cdf module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present; dependencies are specified for installation.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file to include as long description; importing package version to set version; installing specified dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. The code appears straightforward for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and a package version, reads a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata. No user input, network communication, or code execution beyond standard package setup. Dependencies are fixed versions, reducing risk. No anomalies or signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious code detected. It simply specifies metadata and dependencies for package distribution.",
