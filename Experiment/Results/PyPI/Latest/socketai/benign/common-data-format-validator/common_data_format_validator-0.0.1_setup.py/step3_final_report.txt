  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'common-data-format-validator'.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'cdf.__version__' and reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads version and description files, then calls setup() with fixed dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic code, network calls, or untrusted input. It imports version info from a local module, reads a markdown file, and calls setup() with fixed dependencies. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. All dependencies are pinned, and the code follows standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
