{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up and configuring a Python package named 'common-data-format-validator' with its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version from the 'cdf' module and reading the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None of the code involves untrusted data sinks such as network transmission, file writes, or execution of external commands.",
  "flows": "Package version from 'cdf.__version__' flows into setup configuration; README content flows into package description.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. No malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup tools for Python package configuration, including reading version info from a module and reading a README file for documentation. All dependencies are explicitly specified with fixed versions, reducing risk of supply chain attacks through dependency tampering. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and typical of a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It properly manages dependencies and metadata without any suspicious or malicious components.",
