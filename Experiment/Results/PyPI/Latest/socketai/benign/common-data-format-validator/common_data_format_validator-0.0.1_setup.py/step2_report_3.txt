  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Standard setup script using setuptools.\n- Reads version from `cdf.__version__`.\n- Reads README.md for long description.\n- Defines fixed dependencies.\n- No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or suspicious code.  \n  **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports\n- **Logical accuracy:**  \n  All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the script is standard and benign.  \n  **No flaws detected.**\n\n---\n\n### Score Justifications\n- **Obfuscated score (0):**  \n  Correct, no obfuscation observed.  \n- **Malware score (0):**  \n  Correct, no malicious activity or code detected.  \n- **Security risk score (0):**  \n  Correct, no evident security issues.\n\nAll scores seem reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Risk Score Justification\n- The overall risk score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Malware Score Justification\n- Since there's no suspicious code, network activity, or malicious intent, malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities and Assumptions\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they only state that the code is standard and safe.\n- Importing version info from a local module (`cdf.__version__`) is typical and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and Recommendations\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The fixed dependencies and straightforward file reads are standard practice, reducing supply chain risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No further action or concern is necessary.",
