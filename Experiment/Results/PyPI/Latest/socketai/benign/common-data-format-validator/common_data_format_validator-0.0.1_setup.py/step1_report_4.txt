{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'common-data-format-validator'. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and other installation details.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version from the cdf.__version__ variable and reads the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this code that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The version information flows from the cdf module into the setup configuration. The README content flows from the file read into the long_description parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The version is imported from a local module, which is standard practice. No dynamic execution or external code execution appears involved.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: importing necessary functions, reading the version from a local module, reading a documentation file, and configuring setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All operations are straightforward. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The dependencies listed are fixed versions, and no user input is processed during setup. The only external data read is the README.md file and version info, which are standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It reads local files and static version info to configure package installation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
