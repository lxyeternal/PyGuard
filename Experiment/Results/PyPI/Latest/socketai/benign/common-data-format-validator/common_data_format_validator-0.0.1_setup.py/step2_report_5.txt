  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a standard Python `setup.py` script.\n- It imports `setuptools` functions and a version string from a local module `cdf`.\n- Reads the `README.md` for long description.\n- Calls `setup()` with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration.\n- Dependencies are fixed versions, no dynamic code execution or network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is straightforward and typical for package setup.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No, no network calls, code injection, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Hardcoded secrets:** None.\n- **Dependencies:** Fixed versions, which is good practice.\n- **Version sourcing:** From local module `cdf.__version__`, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and reasoning review:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a standard setup script.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is claimed or observed.\n- No anomalies or unusual patterns.\n- The code reads local files and a version string, then calls `setup()`.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 — justified; no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — justified; code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified; no evident security issues.\n\n### Potential adjustments:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable in their scoring.\n- No report assigns a risk score above 0.1, which aligns with the lack of suspicious activity.\n- The malware score is appropriately zero, given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Keep dependencies pinned to specific versions to reduce supply chain risks.\n- Continue standard practices for package setup.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's straightforward nature.",
