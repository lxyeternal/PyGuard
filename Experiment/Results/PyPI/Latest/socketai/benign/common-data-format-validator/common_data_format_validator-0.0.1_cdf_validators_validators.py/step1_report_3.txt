{
  "purpose": "Define multiple schema validator classes inheriting from a common base class, each specifying a different validator type.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.common' that provides 'SchemaValidator'.",
  "nets": "None; no untrusted data sources are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows or processing logic shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward class definitions with class methods returning static strings.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines four subclasses of 'SchemaValidator', each overriding a class method to return a specific string identifier. There are no data manipulations, network operations, or dynamic code executions. The import suggests dependency on an external module, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The structure appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard class inheritance with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a validation framework, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
