{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple subclasses of SchemaValidator, each returning a specific validator type string",
  "sources": "Import statement importing SchemaValidator from a relative module",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines classes and methods without data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from SchemaValidator with class methods returning static strings. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or other security concerns are present. The import is a relative import which is typical in modular code bases and does not indicate malicious intent. The code appears to serve as a structural setup for different schema validators, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward class hierarchy setup for schema validation purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It appears benign and purely structural.",
