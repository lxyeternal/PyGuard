{
  "purpose": "Define specific schema validator classes for different validation types within a framework.",
  "sources": "Import from the local module `.common` providing `SchemaValidator`",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static class methods returning fixed strings",
  "flows": "No data flow; class hierarchy and method overrides are static and do not process external input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no dynamic behavior or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code consists of four subclasses of `SchemaValidator`, each overriding `validator_type()` to return a fixed string. There are no data inputs, external communications, or dynamic code execution. The code is simple, clear, and serves as utility classes for schema validation categorization. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code's benign nature is consistent with the absence of any malicious activity, external data handling, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as static class definitions for schema validation purposes. No malicious or security concerns are evident, and the scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and securityRisk: 0 are appropriate.",
