{
  "purpose": "Define multiple subclasses of SchemaValidator with specific validator types for schema validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement for common.SchemaValidator; class definitions and class methods within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform external actions are present.",
  "flows": "Class methods return static string values; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward subclass definitions that override a class method to specify a validator type. It imports a base class and defines subclasses with fixed return values. No external input handling, no dynamic execution, and no malicious behaviors are observable. The structure is simple and conventional, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of schema validator subclasses, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
