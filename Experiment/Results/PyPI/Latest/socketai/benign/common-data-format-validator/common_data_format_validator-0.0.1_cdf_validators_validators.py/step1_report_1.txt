{
  "purpose": "Define multiple schema validator classes inheriting from a common base class, each providing a specific validator type.",
  "sources": "Import statement for '.common' module, which provides 'SchemaValidator'. No other data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present; the code only defines classes and methods.",
  "flows": "The classes define methods that return static string values. No data flow from sources to sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a base class and defines four subclasses, each overriding a class method to return a specific string indicating their validator type. There is no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be part of a larger system where these classes are used for schema validation purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple and standard class hierarchy for schema validators, with no indications of malicious behavior or security threats. It appears benign and typical for such utility classes.",
