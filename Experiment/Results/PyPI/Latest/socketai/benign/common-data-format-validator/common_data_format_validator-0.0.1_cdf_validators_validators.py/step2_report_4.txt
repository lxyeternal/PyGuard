  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward set of class definitions inheriting from a base class `SchemaValidator`.\n- Each subclass overrides a class method `validator_type()` to return a specific string.\n- The code only imports a class from a local module `.common`.\n- There are no data flows, external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger validation framework, serving as utility classes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious activity or security issues.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors in reports?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Risk scores:**  \n  All reports assign `securityRisk: 0`, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The high confidence scores (mostly 1, some 1.0) are justified given the straightforward, benign nature.\n- No report claims or implies any malicious behavior or vulnerabilities that would warrant higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThese scores are appropriate and consistent with the code and reports.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code is purely structural and utility-based, there's no reason to assign any higher scores.\n- The reports are thorough and align well with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is benign, straightforward class inheritance for schema validation.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0**.  \nNo further action needed.",
