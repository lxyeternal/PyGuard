{
  "purpose": "Define multiple subclasses of SchemaValidator, each representing a different validator type.",
  "sources": "Imports SchemaValidator from the current package/module; class definitions and method calls within the code.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; method returns are straightforward strings.",
  "flows": "Class methods return static strings based on class identity, with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behavior; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses of SchemaValidator with class methods returning specific strings. There is no user input handling, no external data reading, and no insecure operations. The structure is simple, and the code appears to be standard object-oriented class extension without malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines subclasses with static return values for 'validator_type', with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and purposeful for categorizing validator types.",
