  "purpose": "A client for converting text to speech via an external API, using app credentials and timestamp-based signatures for authentication.",
  "sources": "App key, app secret, timestamp generated internally, text input for conversion.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request sending JSON data to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Input data (app_key, app_secret, text) -> signature generation -> request_data assembly -> HTTP request to external API.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no suspicious data handling; signature and timestamp generation appear standard; use of hashing is normal for signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes with provided credentials and creates a timestamp and signature for authentication. The convert_with_timestamps method constructs a JSON payload with user-supplied text and optional parameters, then sends it via HTTP POST to an external API endpoint. There are no embedded or obfuscated malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or backdoors. The code relies on external libraries (httpx, hashlib, json) in a typical manner. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected. The use of API keys and signing is standard for authentication, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate client for a text-to-speech service, with proper handling of credentials and data. There are no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
