  "purpose": "A Python class for converting text to speech using an external TextToSpeechClient.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters (app_key, app_secret) for authentication; method parameters (text, speaker, audio_type, speed, rate, volume, pitch, streaming) for data input.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak if sensitive credentials (app_key, app_secret) are exposed; no apparent sink for untrusted data other than calling external API.",
  "flows": "Credentials (app_key, app_secret) flow into the TextToSpeechClient during initialization; user-provided text flows into convert_with_timestamps method; no other data flows indicated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious variable names or unusual code patterns, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code. Usage of external HTTP client is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class MobvoiTTS that wraps a text-to-speech client. It accepts optional credentials for authentication and passes parameters to generate speech audio. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious network activity observed. The input parameters are typical for TTS functions, and no unusual data handling is evident. The external dependencies (httpx, TextToSpeechClient) are used as intended. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code injection are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a text-to-speech wrapper. It securely accepts optional credentials and forwards input data to an external TTS service without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
