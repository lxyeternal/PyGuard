  "purpose": "A wrapper class for an external TextToSpeechClient, facilitating TTS conversion with configurable parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to generate() method (text, speaker, audio_type, speed, rate, volume, pitch, streaming), optional credentials (app_key, app_secret).",
  "sinks": "The external convert_with_timestamps() method, which may perform network requests or data processing, but is encapsulated.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from generate() to convert_with_timestamps(), with optional credentials passed during class instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in DEFAULT_SPAEKER variable; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around an external TTS client, accepting optional credentials and forwarding parameters. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are evident. The typo in DEFAULT_SPAEKER is benign. External API calls are encapsulated within the client, with no direct network activity visible here. The code does not perform any insecure operations or data leaks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The external dependency and optional credentials do not introduce significant security concerns within this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard wrapper around a TTS service, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minor typo does not impact security. The scores across reports are justified and appropriate.",
