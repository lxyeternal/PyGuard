  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling file output paths and filenames, including error handling and directory permissions.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from input parameters (output_directory, base_path), reads system paths, checks directory permissions, and accesses filesystem to create directories.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writing to filesystem directories, checking write permissions, creating directories.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> is_file_writeable() checks -> make_output_path() attempts to create or access directories.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution. Use of exception raising for errors is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for managing output file paths. It checks directory existence and permissions before creating directories. It constructs filenames with timestamps and text snippets. The code uses standard Python libraries and does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification beyond filesystem operations. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The exception handling is straightforward and used for permission issues, which is normal. The logic is clear and secure for the intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard utility code for filesystem path handling and filename generation. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malware signs are present.",
