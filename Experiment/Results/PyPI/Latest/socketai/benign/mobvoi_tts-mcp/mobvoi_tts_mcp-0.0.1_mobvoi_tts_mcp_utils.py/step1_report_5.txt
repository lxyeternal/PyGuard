  "purpose": "Utility functions for file path handling, output file naming, and error management related to output directory creation and file writing.",
  "sources": "User-supplied paths via 'output_directory' and 'base_path'; text input used for output filename generation.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data directly affects sensitive operations beyond file path handling.",
  "flows": "User input paths influence output directory creation; text influences output filename; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations beyond path handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for managing output paths and filenames, including validation of write permissions and directory creation. It does not execute untrusted code or perform network operations. The filename generation uses provided text data, but this appears to be for labeling purposes rather than malicious intent. Error handling is standard and does not leak sensitive data. The functions handle common filesystem operations without risky behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for handling output paths and filenames, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided snippet.",
