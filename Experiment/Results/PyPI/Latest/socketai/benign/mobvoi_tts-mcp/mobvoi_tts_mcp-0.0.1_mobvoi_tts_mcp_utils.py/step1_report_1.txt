  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating error messages, checking file write permissions, and generating output file paths and names based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "User-supplied paths (output_directory, base_path), text input for filename prefix",
  "sinks": "Filesystem operations (mkdir, os.access, path creation), raising custom exceptions",
  "flows": "Input paths and text influence output paths and filenames; permission checks before directory creation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or obfuscated code. Use of os.access and directory creation is standard. No suspicious input handling or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for file path generation and permission checking. It raises custom exceptions if directory permissions are insufficient. All operations are standard filesystem manipulations without external network communication or data leaks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The logic appears straightforward and intended solely for file management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a helper for managing output files and directories with proper permission checks. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The code is safe and standard for such utility functions.",
