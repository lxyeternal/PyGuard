  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating and managing output file paths and handling errors related to file operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'text', 'output_path', 'output_directory', 'base_path'.",
  "sinks": "File system operations like checking writability, creating directories, and generating filenames.",
  "flows": "User-provided parameters flow into directory creation and filename generation functions; no untrusted external data sources or network operations present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution or external data fetching. The code straightforwardly manages file paths and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper functions for output file management: checking directory writability, creating output filenames with timestamps, and constructing output paths based on user input or defaults. It includes proper exception handling for permission errors. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or security-critical actions outside file system access. It is standard utility code for file management with appropriate safety checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It properly manages file paths and handles errors safely. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities within this code segment.",
