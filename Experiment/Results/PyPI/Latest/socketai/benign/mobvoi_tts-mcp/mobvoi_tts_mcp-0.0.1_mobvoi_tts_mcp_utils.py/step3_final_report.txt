  "purpose": "Utility functions for error handling, permission checks, filename and path creation in filesystem management.",
  "sources": "Path existence checks, os.access for write permissions, text input for filename generation, output_directory and base_path parameters for path resolution.",
  "sinks": "Directory creation with mkdir, raising custom exceptions, path concatenation for output files.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (text, output_directory, base_path) influence output filename and path; permission checks prevent unauthorized directory creation; exceptions are raised on permission issues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward filesystem operations; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem operations: checking directory existence and permissions, creating directories, generating filenames with timestamps, and handling errors via custom exceptions. No external network calls, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. Input parameters are used for filename and path generation, which is typical and not inherently risky. Permission checks and exception handling are correctly implemented. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misuse of user inputs, but no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a safe, standard utility module for filesystem management with proper permission checks and error handling. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities are detected. The low security risk score reflects the minimal potential for misuse via inputs, but the code itself is benign.",
