  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is minimal, consisting solely of a comment and a single version string assignment:\n     ```python\n     \"\"\"MObvoi TTS MCP Server package.\"\"\"\n     __version__ = \"0.0.1\"\n     ```\n   - There are no functions, data processing, I/O operations, external dependencies, or embedded code that could be malicious.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, serving only as metadata.\n   - They correctly identify the lack of sources, sinks, flows, or executable logic.\n   - Their confidence levels are high (1), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n   - The analyses are consistent and reasonable.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is justified given the absence of any malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the minimal, metadata-only nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are thorough and accurate for this fragment.\n   - Since the code is just a version string, any higher risk or malware scores would be unwarranted.\n   - No assumptions are made about other parts of the package; based solely on this snippet, the assessment is correct.\n\n5. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code is clearly benign.\n   - The high confidence and zero scores are appropriate.\n   - No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code provided. No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.",
