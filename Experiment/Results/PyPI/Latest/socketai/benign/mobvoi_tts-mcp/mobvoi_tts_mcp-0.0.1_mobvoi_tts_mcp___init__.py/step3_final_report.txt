  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a descriptive comment and a version string assignment, with no executable logic, data processing, or external dependencies. All review reports correctly identify it as benign, metadata-only, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of any security concerns. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code does not pose any threat or risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as package metadata. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No further action or concern is necessary based on this snippet.",
