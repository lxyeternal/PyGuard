  "purpose": "Importing the TextToSpeechClient class from a local module named 'client'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'client' and accesses the TextToSpeechClient class within it.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this single line; no untrusted data handling or external data flow.",
  "flows": "N/A; this is only an import statement without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a local module, which is a common pattern in Python projects. No external data sources, no code execution, no credentials or secrets are visible, and no malicious behavior is evident from this line alone. Since this is just an import statement, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project where 'client' is a local module.",
