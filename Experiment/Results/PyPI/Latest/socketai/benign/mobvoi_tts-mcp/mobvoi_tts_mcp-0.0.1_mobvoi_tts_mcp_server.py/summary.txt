  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented TTS wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to external dependencies and environment variable handling, which are standard practices."
