{
  "purpose": "Implement a text-to-speech conversion service using the MobvoiTTS SDK, allowing users to specify speech parameters and save output files locally.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for API credentials, user input parameters for speech synthesis, SDK generate method for audio data.",
  "sinks": "File system where audio files are saved; no network sinks or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (text, speaker, etc.) flow into the generate() SDK call, with output written directly to a local file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior detected. The code uses standard SDK calls and environment variables appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads API credentials from environment variables, performs a legitimate API call to generate speech audio, and saves the output locally. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious payloads are present. Input validation is minimal but appropriate for the context. The overall structure is clear and standard for such services.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented TTS wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to external dependencies and environment variable handling, which are standard practices.",
