{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to convert text to speech using Mobvoi TTS service and save the output to a specified directory.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (APP_KEY, APP_SECRET, MOBVOI_TTS_MCP_BASE_PATH), user input parameters in the text_to_speech function.",
  "sinks": "Writing audio data to a file in the output directory, printing base_path, and returning success message with file path.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at startup, inputs (text, optional parameters) are used to generate audio, data flows from generate() call to file write, and then return message.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; environment variables are used for credentials. The code appears straightforward and typical for a text-to-speech service. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables for API credentials, initializes an HTTP client and a TTS client, and defines a tool to convert text to speech and save as a file. The main function starts a server, likely for handling requests. The core function 'text_to_speech' validates input, constructs output paths, calls the TTS API, writes the audio data to disk, and returns a success message. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or unauthorized data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity beyond legitimate API calls, and no obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a text-to-speech service wrapper, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It uses environment variables for credentials, handles data securely, and performs expected operations without hidden or suspicious actions.",
