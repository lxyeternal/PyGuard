  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a TTS client with no malicious intent or supply chain security issues. The primary concerns are minor bugs and best practice violations, not security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to minor bugs. These scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
