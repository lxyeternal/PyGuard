  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement: `from .client import MobvoiTTS`. This is a standard Python operation for importing a class from a local module. There is no evidence of data processing, network activity, or other potentially malicious operations in this snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the minimal nature of the code, the absence of anomalies, and the benign intent. No logical errors or misconceptions are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: Mostly 0, with one report noting 0.1. Given the code's nature, a small 0.1 might be a cautious placeholder, but it isn't justified by any evidence of risk.\n\n4. **Risk & Malware Justification**:  \n   Since the code is purely an import statement, there is no malware or malicious activity. The risk score should remain very low, close to zero, unless additional context suggests otherwise.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code's benign nature. No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear code)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk based solely on this snippet)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- If the broader codebase or context introduces other suspicious elements, reassessment might be necessary. But based solely on this import statement, there's no indication of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and safe. The current scores are appropriate, and no changes are warranted.",
