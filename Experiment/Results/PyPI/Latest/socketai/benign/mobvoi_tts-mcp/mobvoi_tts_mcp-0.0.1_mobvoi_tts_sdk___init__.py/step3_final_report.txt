{
  "purpose": "To assess the security implications of the import statement 'from .client import MobvoiTTS' in the context of supply chain security.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module '.client' and imports the 'MobvoiTTS' class.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The source is the local module import; since no runtime data or external inputs are involved, no data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The security assessment relies on the assumption that the module and class are trustworthy. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: near zero) are consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet. The primary concern would be the trustworthiness of the source module, which cannot be determined from this snippet alone. Overall, the code appears safe, with minimal security risk, unless the source module is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and poses no immediate security threat. The scores reflect low malware likelihood and minimal risk. The main concern remains the trustworthiness of the source module, which is outside the scope of this snippet.",
