  "purpose": "Importing the MobvoiTTS class from a local module named 'client'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'client' module and accesses 'MobvoiTTS'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this line.",
  "flows": "The code imports a class from a module; no data flow occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement, which is a standard Python operation for module inclusion. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. Since it's a simple import, no data flow or input/output operations are visible at this point. Without additional context or code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, serving as an import statement for a class. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based solely on this line.",
