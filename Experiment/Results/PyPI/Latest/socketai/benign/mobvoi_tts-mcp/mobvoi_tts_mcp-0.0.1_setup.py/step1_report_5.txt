{
  "purpose": "The code is used for setting up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package data through find_packages() and include_package_data=True.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It imports setup functions from setuptools, uses find_packages() to locate all packages in the directory, and includes package data as specified. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The code is minimal and conventional for package distribution purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
