  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, minimal setup script for a Python package. It imports setuptools, calls setup() with find_packages() and include_package_data=True. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious patterns justify these scores. No anomalies or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
