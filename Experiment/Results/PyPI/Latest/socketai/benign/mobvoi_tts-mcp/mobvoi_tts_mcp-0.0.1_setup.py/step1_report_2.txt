  "purpose": "To set up a Python package by specifying package data and including all packages found.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it uses internal functions to locate packages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing setup functions to executing setup with parameters; no external data flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script that imports necessary functions and calls setup with typical parameters. It uses find_packages() to automatically discover packages and includes package data. There are no suspicious code patterns, no dynamic execution, no network activity, and no hardcoded credentials. The script is minimal and aligns with common package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
