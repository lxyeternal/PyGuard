  "purpose": "The code is used to configure and set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package data via find_packages() and the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing functions to invoking setup() with package data, with no untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, utilizing setuptools. It calls find_packages() to locate packages and includes package data as specified. There are no dynamic code executions, no external data reads, and no suspicious operations. The script appears minimal and typical for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
