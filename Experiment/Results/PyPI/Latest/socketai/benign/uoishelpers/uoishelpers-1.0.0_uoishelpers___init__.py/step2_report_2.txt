  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a simple import statement with no execution or malicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** All scores (confidence, obfuscated, malware, securityRisk) are at maximum or zero as appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as Report 1, the import is benign.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** All scores are appropriate; confidence is high, malware is zero. No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Again, a straightforward import with no evident malicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The confidence score is 0.9, which is slightly lower than others, but still acceptable given the minimal code.  \n- **Scores:** All are reasonable; malware is zero.  \n- **Note:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are indicated.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The import is benign, but the securityRisk is noted as 0.1, which is slightly above zero.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The reasoning is consistent; the code is minimal.  \n- **Scores:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 seems to reflect a very minor concern, perhaps overestimating risk for such trivial code. Since there's no suspicious activity, I would suggest lowering this to 0.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same benign import.  \n- **Scores:** All scores are appropriate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of observations:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, matching the minimal code.\n- The confidence scores are high, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The only minor inconsistency is the securityRisk score in Report 4, which is slightly elevated despite no evidence of risk.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and benign nature, I would assign a risk score of **0** across all reports, including Report 4, to reflect no meaningful security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\nThe code is a simple import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores in the reports are generally appropriate, with the exception of a very minor securityRisk in Report 4, which I recommend lowering to zero.\n\n**My recommended scores for this code:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the minimal nature of the code snippet.",
