  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the validity of conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a simple import statement: `from .main import hello`.\n- The code snippet is minimal, with no execution, data handling, or external input/output.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The reports correctly conclude that the code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Presence Verification**\n\n- **Code Content:**  \n  The original code is `from .main import hello`.  \n  This is a standard relative import in Python, importing a symbol `hello` from a local module `main`.\n\n- **Are issues present?**  \n  Based solely on this snippet:\n  - No malicious code, malware, or suspicious behavior is evident.\n  - No data leaks, obfuscation, or code execution.\n  - No external inputs or outputs.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo issues are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Individual Reports**\n\n#### **Report 1**  \n- **Findings:** No anomalies, benign import, high confidence (1).  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0  \n- **Assessment:**  \n  Fully consistent. No need to change scores.\n\n#### **Report 2**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, high confidence (1).  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0  \n- **Assessment:**  \n  Consistent, no issues.\n\n#### **Report 3**  \n- **Findings:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9).  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0  \n- **Assessment:**  \n  Given the simplicity, the confidence score is acceptable. No need to adjust.\n\n#### **Report 4**  \n- **Findings:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1).  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1  \n- **Assessment:**  \n  The security risk score of 0.1 suggests a minimal concern, perhaps due to the import pattern.  \n  **Is this justified?**  \n  - No, the import alone does not pose a security risk.  \n  - A score of 0.1 seems slightly overcautious but acceptable if conservative.  \n  **Recommendation:**  \n  - Keep as is, or reduce to 0, since no actual risk is present.\n\n#### **Report 5**  \n- **Findings:** Same as others, very benign.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0  \n- **Assessment:**  \n  Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Scores and Justifications**\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  Most reports assign 0, except report 4, which assigns 0.1.  \n  Since the code is just an import statement with no malicious or risky behavior, a risk score of 0 is more accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Adjust the securityRisk score in report 4 to 0.**  \n  The presence of an import statement alone does not constitute a security risk.\n\n- **Overall malware and obfuscated scores are correct.**  \n  No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate**\n\nConsidering all reports and the code snippet:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, standard Python syntax, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways consider context—if this import is part of a larger codebase, further analysis might be needed, but based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
