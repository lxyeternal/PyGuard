  "purpose": "The code imports the 'hello' function or variable from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; only a module import without execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of context; simple import statement suggests minimal risk. No suspicious patterns or embedded code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'hello' from a local module 'main'. There is no execution, input handling, or data processing visible. As it is only an import statement, it does not perform any malicious activity by itself. Without additional context or code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, benign Python package. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected based solely on this snippet.",
