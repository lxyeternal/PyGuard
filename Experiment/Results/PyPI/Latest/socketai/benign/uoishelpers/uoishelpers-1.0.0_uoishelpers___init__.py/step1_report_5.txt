  "analysis": "The code simply performs a relative import from the 'main' module. It does not execute any code, read external input, or perform network or file operations. This is a typical import statement found in Python packages to organize code into modules. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain any suspicious behavior or anomalous patterns.",
