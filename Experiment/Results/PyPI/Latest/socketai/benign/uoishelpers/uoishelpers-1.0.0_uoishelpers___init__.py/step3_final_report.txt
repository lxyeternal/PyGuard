{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'hello' function or object from a local module 'main', serving as a simple import statement with no inherent malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the import is static and does not involve runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement in Python, importing 'hello' from a local module 'main'. There are no runtime behaviors, data handling, or external interactions. All reviews correctly identify the benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting no malicious or risky behavior. Minor discrepancies in confidence or risk scores (e.g., report 4's 0.1) are unnecessary; the most accurate assessment is that the code is entirely benign. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident based solely on this import statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no security concerns. All reports are accurate; the most appropriate scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
