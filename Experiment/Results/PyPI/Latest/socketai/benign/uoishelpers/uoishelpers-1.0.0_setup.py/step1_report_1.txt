  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; standard setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this is a setup script with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward use of setuptools for package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies the package name, version, and an empty list for dependencies. The script is typical for Python package setup, with no suspicious or unusual constructs, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code injection. The script solely provides package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies, with no suspicious or harmful elements present.",
