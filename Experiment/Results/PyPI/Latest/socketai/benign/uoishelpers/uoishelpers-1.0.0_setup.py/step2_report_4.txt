  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package.\n- It uses standard functions from setuptools (`setup`, `find_packages()`).\n- No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data sources are involved.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Any logical errors?**  \n  **No.** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Confidence scores (mostly 1):** justified, as the analysis is thorough and consistent.\n- **Obfuscated scores (0):** correct, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware scores (0):** correct, no malware behavior identified.\n- **Security risk scores:** mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, which is acceptable given the benign nature.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Most are 0, with one at 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, a risk score higher than 0.1 would be unwarranted.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimates:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The scoring aligns well with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign Python package setup script. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
