  "purpose": "Setuptools setup script for packaging a Python project named 'uoishelpers'.",
  "sources": "User input via setup parameters and package discovery with find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data leakage or external data transmission detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script primarily defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata. No external data handling, environment variable misuse, or code injection identified. The use of find_packages() is typical for package discovery, and install_requires is empty, indicating no external dependencies. Overall, the code performs a benign setup routine without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements and poses no security risks.",
