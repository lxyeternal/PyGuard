  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code in question is a standard setup script using setuptools.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, or external data handling.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the original provided code.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Accuracy:** All reports correctly identify the code as a straightforward, benign setup script.\n- **Redundancy:** Multiple reports repeat similar assessments; this is acceptable given the uniformity of the code.\n- **Potential overconfidence:** The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1. Given the code's nature, even a small positive score might be an overestimation.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The code is purely static configuration with no runtime behavior, so the **risk score** should be **0**.\n- The **malware** score should remain **0**.\n- The **obfuscated** score should be **0**.\n\n### Critical analysis:\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are justified; the code does not handle data, secrets, or network operations.\n- No assumptions are made about hidden behaviors; the assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and no security concerns are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, non-malicious setup script.\n- All scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- No further security risks are identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe package setup code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
