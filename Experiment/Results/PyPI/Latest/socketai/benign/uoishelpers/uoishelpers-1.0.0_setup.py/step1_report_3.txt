  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'uoishelpers' Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata and dependencies; no external input or data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script only invokes setup functions with predefined arguments.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard setup configuration with no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with fixed parameters: package name, version, packages, and empty dependencies. It performs no dynamic execution, no input handling, and no suspicious operations. There are no hardcoded secrets, external network interactions, or other malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
