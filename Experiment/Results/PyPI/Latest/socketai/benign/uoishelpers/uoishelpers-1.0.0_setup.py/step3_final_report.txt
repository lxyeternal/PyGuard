{
  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports modules and defines static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code is static.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script executes static configuration commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static setup script with no dynamic execution, input handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. One report assigns a very low security risk score of 0.1, which is an overestimation given the code's simplicity. The overall assessment is that the code poses no security threat. The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. The minor overestimation of security risk in one report should be corrected to 0. The malware and obfuscation scores are accurate at 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
