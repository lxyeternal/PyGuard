  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\ndef hello():\n    print(\"Hello from Marat\")\n```\n- It’s a simple function that prints a static message.\n- No inputs, no external data, no network or file operations.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and without malicious intent.\n- All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are 0.\n- Confidence is high (1) in all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does **not** contain any vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n- **Scores:** Given the benign nature, the scores seem appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n- **Risk scores (>0.5):** All are 0, which is justified.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code’s behavior.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the code and each other.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a trivial greeting function with no security concerns.",
