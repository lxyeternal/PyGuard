  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints a greeting message.",
  "sources": "The function 'hello' reads no external input or data; it is a static print statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks are involved; the code only outputs a static message.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the function executes a print statement with a constant string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that prints a fixed message. It does not process external inputs, connect to networks, access files, or perform any operations that could be malicious. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, with high confidence. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reviews and scores are consistent and appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
