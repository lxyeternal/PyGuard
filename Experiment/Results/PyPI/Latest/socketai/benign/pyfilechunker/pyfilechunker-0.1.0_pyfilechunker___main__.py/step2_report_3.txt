  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a CLI wrapper that calls an external `chunk_it` function.\n- The code itself appears benign: no obfuscation, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets.\n- The main concern is the external `chunk_it` function, which is not provided. Its behavior could introduce security risks if malicious.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and low security risks (~0.1-0.2), which seems reasonable given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Flaws:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  The code is straightforward; no issues are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the security depends on `chunk_it`. They do not assume malicious behavior without evidence.  \n  No logical flaws are apparent.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2).  \n  These seem reasonable, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign a risk > 0.5, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since the code does not contain malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation, malware=0 is justified. The main risk lies in the external `chunk_it` function, which cannot be assessed here.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about `chunk_it`. They acknowledge the external dependency as a potential concern but do not claim maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, low security risk.\n\n- **Potential improvements:**  \n  - The reports could mention that if `chunk_it` is malicious, the overall system could be compromised. But they do note this dependency.\n  - The risk scores could be slightly higher if considering the external dependency, but given the evidence, the low scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior in this snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — low, considering the external dependency; slightly higher than the reports suggest, but still low because the code itself is benign.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and cautious, correctly identifying that the security risk hinges on the external `chunk_it` function. Given the information, the assigned scores are reasonable, and I agree with them.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nIf further analysis of `chunk_it` becomes available, reassessment of malware and risk scores would be warranted.",
