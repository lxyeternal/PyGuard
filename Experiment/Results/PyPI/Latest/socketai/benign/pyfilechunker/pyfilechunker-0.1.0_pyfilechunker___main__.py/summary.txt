  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign wrapper with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security risk depends on the implementation of the external chunk_it function. Based solely on this code, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2). Continuous review of chunk_it is recommended for comprehensive security assurance."
