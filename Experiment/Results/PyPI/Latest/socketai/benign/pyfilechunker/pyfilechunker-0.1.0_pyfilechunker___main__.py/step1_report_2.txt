  "purpose": "Command-line utility to split a large file into smaller chunks based on specified record delimiters.",
  "sources": "User provides file_path, num_chunks, record_begin, record_end, output_dir via command-line arguments; file_path is used to read the input file.",
  "sinks": "The chunk_it function is called with filename and output directory parameters; potential data flow occurs if chunk_it processes untrusted or malicious data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (file_path, output_dir, record delimiters) -> chunk_it function -> output files; no evidence of untrusted data being sent over the network or system manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution; the code appears straightforward and standard for a CLI utility.",
  "analysis": "The script uses Typer for CLI and imports a chunk_it function, likely to handle file chunking. It accepts user inputs for file path, number of chunks, record delimiters, and output directory. These inputs are used to invoke chunk_it, which presumably processes the file. No code injects or executes untrusted code, connects to external servers, or manipulates system files maliciously. Exception handling is minimal but standard. There are no signs of hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The script relies on external library functions, but nothing indicates malicious intent within the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI utility for file processing with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It securely handles inputs, and no suspicious activities are evident. The overall security risk is low.",
