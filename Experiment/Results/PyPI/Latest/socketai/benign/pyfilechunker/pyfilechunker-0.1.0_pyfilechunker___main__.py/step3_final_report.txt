{
  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for file chunking that accepts user parameters and invokes an external chunk_it function to process files based on record delimiters.",
  "sources": "User input parameters: file_path, num_chunks, record_begin, record_end, output_dir",
  "sinks": "The external function chunk_it, which processes the file; no direct sinks in this code",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and resolved, then passed to chunk_it; no other data flows are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard; reliance on external chunk_it function is noted",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI interface that validates inputs, creates output directories, and calls the external chunk_it function. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The main security concern is the behavior of chunk_it, which is external and unreviewed. Exception handling is appropriate. The code itself is benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign wrapper with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security risk depends on the implementation of the external chunk_it function. Based solely on this code, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2). Continuous review of chunk_it is recommended for comprehensive security assurance.",
