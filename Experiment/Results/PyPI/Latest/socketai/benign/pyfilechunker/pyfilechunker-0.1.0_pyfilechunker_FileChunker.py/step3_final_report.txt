  "purpose": "A utility to split large files into smaller chunks based on specified record delimiters, using mmap for boundary detection and file I/O for chunk extraction.",
  "sources": "File size retrieval, mmap for boundary searching, file read operations, filename and path inputs.",
  "sinks": "Writing chunk files to disk, logging boundary detection and process steps.",
  "flows": "Reads file size and content, searches for record delimiters via mmap, determines boundary positions, then seeks and writes chunks to separate files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity. Potential minor concern about filename handling, but mitigated by use of os.path.join and standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file boundary detection and chunking using mmap for efficiency. It includes proper error handling, logging, and safe boundary calculations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The use of mmap and string searches for boundary detection is appropriate and safe. The only minor concern is external filename inputs potentially leading to path injection, but the code's use of os.path.join and external sanitization outside scope reduces this risk. Overall, the code is a legitimate, transparent utility for file processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured file chunking utility with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified, primarily considering potential external filename manipulation, which is outside the code's scope. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is 0, indicating a benign and transparent implementation.",
