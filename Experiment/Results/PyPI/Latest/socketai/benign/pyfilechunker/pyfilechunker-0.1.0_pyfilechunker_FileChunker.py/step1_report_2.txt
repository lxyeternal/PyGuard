{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to split large text files into smaller chunks based on record boundaries, useful for processing large datasets or streaming data.",
  "sources": "Reads the input file via open() in read-binary mode, and reads from the file for chunk boundary detection and chunk extraction.",
  "sinks": "Writes chunked data into new files in the specified output directory.",
  "flows": "Reads input file -> determines boundaries using mmap and string searches -> writes chunks to separate files based on boundaries.",
  "anomalies": "Uses mmap for boundary detection; no suspicious hard-coded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names detected. Logging is standard, no malicious commands observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs file size checks, boundary detection via mmap and record delimiters, and chunk writing. It employs standard libraries (os, shutil, loguru). No code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity is present. Boundary detection is based on string searches and file reads; no user input is directly used in a way that poses security issues. Error handling is standard with exception logging. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are visible. The code is straightforward, focused on file processing with safe practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate file chunking utility with no malicious intent. It handles files safely, with proper boundary detection and chunk writing. No malware or malicious behaviors are detected. It has a low malware score and security risk score.",
