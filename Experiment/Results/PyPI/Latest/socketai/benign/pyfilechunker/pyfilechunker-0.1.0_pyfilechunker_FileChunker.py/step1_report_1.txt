{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to split a large text or binary file into smaller chunks based on specific record boundary markers, useful for processing or analyzing large datasets in manageable segments.",
  "sources": "File system operations (os.path.getsize, open, os.makedirs), mmap reading for boundary detection, environment variables are not used, no external input other than filename, record markers, and output directory.",
  "sinks": "Writing chunk files to disk, logging messages via loguru or log_queue.",
  "flows": "File size and content are read from the filesystem, boundaries are detected via mmap scans, chunk boundaries are calculated and then used to read specific portions of the file and write them to new files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file operations, memory-mapped reading for boundary detection, and chunked file writing. It includes appropriate error handling for file not found and other exceptions. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network access, or backdoors are present. The use of mmap is safe here, primarily for efficient searching. Logging is used for tracing. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are detected. It appears to be a utility script for file processing, with no malicious or sabotage behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate file processing utility designed for chunking files based on record boundaries. It does not contain any malicious code or behavior, nor does it exhibit obfuscation or sabotage patterns. Its security risk score is very low, with no evident malicious intent.",
