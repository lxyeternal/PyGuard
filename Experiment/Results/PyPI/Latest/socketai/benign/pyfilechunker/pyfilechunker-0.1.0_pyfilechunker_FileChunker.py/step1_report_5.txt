{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to split a large file into smaller chunks based on record boundaries defined by specific start and end strings. It provides functions to preview boundary points and perform the actual chunking, with logging support.",
  "sources": "File input via open(filename, 'r+b') for mmap operations, reading the entire file to determine boundaries; reading from the file during chunking process.",
  "sinks": "Writing chunk files to disk; potential for file path injection if filename or output_dir are maliciously crafted, but currently handled by os.path.join and filename sanitization outside this code.",
  "flows": "Source (file read for boundary detection) -> boundary calculation -> reading file segments -> writing to new chunk files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. Use of mmap is standard for large file processing. Logging and directory creation are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs boundary detection by searching for specific record delimiters within a file using mmap, then splits the file into chunks based on these boundaries. It includes error handling for missing files and general exceptions, with logging. No code injections, external network calls, or suspicious operations are present. The code properly manages file handles, and there is no indication of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate utility for file chunking based on record delimiters, with appropriate safety checks and logging. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe file chunking utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly handles file operations, boundary detection, and chunk creation, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious activities.",
