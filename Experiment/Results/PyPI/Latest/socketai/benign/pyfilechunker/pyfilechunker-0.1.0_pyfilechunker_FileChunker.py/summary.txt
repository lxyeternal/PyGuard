  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured file chunking utility with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified, primarily considering potential external filename manipulation, which is outside the code's scope. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is 0, indicating a benign and transparent implementation."
