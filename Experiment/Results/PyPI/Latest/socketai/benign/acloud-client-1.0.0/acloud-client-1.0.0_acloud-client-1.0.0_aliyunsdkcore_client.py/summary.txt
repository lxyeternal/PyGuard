  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK client with no malicious intent or sabotage. The optional import is benign. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to credential handling and network communication, but no malicious activity is evident."
