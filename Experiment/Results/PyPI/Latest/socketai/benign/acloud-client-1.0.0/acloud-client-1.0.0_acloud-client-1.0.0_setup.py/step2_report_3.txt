  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The provided code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools.\n   - There are no obvious malicious or suspicious elements in this script.\n   - The code does not include any obfuscated or hidden code, nor does it perform any network operations or execute external code.\n   - Based solely on this code, there are no apparent security issues or malicious behaviors.\n\n2. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All reports return \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n   - This indicates that the reports do not contain any details about vulnerabilities, malware, obfuscation, or other issues.\n   - Without additional information, it’s impossible to determine if there are issues or to evaluate the reasoning behind any claims.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - Since the reports are empty, there are no logical flaws or mistakes to identify.\n   - The lack of content suggests either the reports are incomplete, improperly generated, or intentionally empty.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - No scores are provided, but based on the content, there is no evidence of malware or vulnerabilities.\n   - If scores were assigned, a malware score of 0.0 would be appropriate.\n   - Risk scores should also be low, given the absence of any suspicious activity.\n\n5. **Potential Malicious or Vulnerable Claims:**\n   - No claims are made, so none can be challenged.\n   - Any assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware would be unfounded given the lack of data.\n\n6. **Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - The code itself is standard and appears safe.\n   - The empty reports do not provide any grounds for concern or escalation.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, primarily because of the lack of information; could be 0 if confirmed safe)\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no indication of security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are uninformative, and no suspicious activity can be inferred. Therefore, the package appears safe, and no further action is necessary unless additional data becomes available.",
