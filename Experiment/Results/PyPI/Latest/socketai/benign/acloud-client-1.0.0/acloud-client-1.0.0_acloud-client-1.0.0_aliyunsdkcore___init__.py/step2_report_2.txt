  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Logic Confirmation:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no input sources, data sinks, data flows, or dynamic code execution present.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The summaries appropriately dismiss any suspicion of malicious activity based on the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - Given the simplicity and benign intent, these scores seem reasonable.\n   - No adjustments are necessary unless new context suggests otherwise.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code is a simple version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified here.\n   - All reports correctly assign a score of 0 for security risk, malware, and obfuscation.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, such as code injection, obfuscated payloads, or network activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - No overreach or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature and assign zero to malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign version declaration in Python. All reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** No changes needed. The code poses no security threat, and the scores are appropriate.",
