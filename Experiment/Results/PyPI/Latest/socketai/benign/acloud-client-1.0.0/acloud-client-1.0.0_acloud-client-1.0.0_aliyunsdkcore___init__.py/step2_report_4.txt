  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:  \nAll reports confirm that the code only assigns a string to the `__version__` variable. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or any dynamic behavior. This is a standard practice in Python packages for versioning.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is minimal and typical, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious logic are detected.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.  \n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.  \n- **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Errors**:  \nThere are no logical errors or questionable claims. The reports are consistent and accurate. Since the code is purely a version string declaration, the assessments are appropriate.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:  \nGiven the simplicity, the code is benign. The scores are reasonable and justified. There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities that are unwarranted, and no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score**: Keep at 0.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: Keep at 0.  \n- **Risk Score**: Keep at 0.\n\nThis code snippet is a straightforward version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware Score**: 0  \n**Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n**Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Rationale**: The code is a simple, standard version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious elements. It poses no security risk, and there is no obfuscation or malware present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: All reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.",
