  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, indicating the package version.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or output operations present.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string to __version__, a common pattern in Python packages. It contains no input handling, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is minimal, static, and transparent, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string assignment with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's function.",
