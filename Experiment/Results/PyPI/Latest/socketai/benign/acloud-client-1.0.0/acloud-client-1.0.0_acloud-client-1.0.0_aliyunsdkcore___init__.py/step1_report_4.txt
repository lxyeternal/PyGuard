  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network communication, or system modification.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow pathways present.",
  "anomalies": "Single assignment of version string, typical for version declaration. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to a variable named __version__, which is a common practice in Python packages. There are no input sources, data sinks, or data flow pathways. No malware indicators, malicious behavior, or security risks are detectable within this minimal snippet. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of versioning information.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard version declaration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The code is benign.",
