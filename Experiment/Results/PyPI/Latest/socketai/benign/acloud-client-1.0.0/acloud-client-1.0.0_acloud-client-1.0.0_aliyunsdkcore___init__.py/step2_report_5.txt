  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\nAll reports describe the code as a simple assignment:\n```python\n__version__ = \"2.14.0\"\n```\nThis is a standard pattern for defining a package version in Python modules. There are no input sources, data sinks, data flows, or code execution involved. The code is minimal, static, and typical.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n- No reports identify any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or secret handling.\n- The version string is hardcoded and does not interact with external data.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n- The reports are consistent; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are present in such a straightforward assignment.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware score = 0\n  - obfuscated = 0\n  - securityRisk = 0\n  - confidence = 1\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n- Since the code is just a version string assignment, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n- The overall security risk is correctly marked as 0.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n- If this code is part of a larger package, the overall security assessment should consider the entire package, but based solely on this snippet, there is no concern.\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and free from malicious intent.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
