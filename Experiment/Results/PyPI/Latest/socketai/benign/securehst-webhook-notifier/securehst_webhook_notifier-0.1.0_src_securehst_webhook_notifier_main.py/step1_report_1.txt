{
  "purpose": "Provides a decorator for sending start, end, and error notifications via webhooks on different messaging platforms.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function arguments (webhook_url, func_identifier, platform, user_id, custom_message). Uses the function's result or exception. Reads configuration for platform selection.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP POST requests with formatted messages to the specified webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Function call triggers start message; on success, sends completion message; on exception, sends error message with optional user mention.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs present. The webhook URL is external input but not stored or transmitted insecurely. No signs of data exfiltration or malicious behavior are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily decorates functions to send notifications via webhooks on start, success, or failure. It uses external libraries (requests) appropriately, with input parameters that are expected for configuration and function metadata. The function handles exceptions gracefully, cleaning SQL-related error messages. No suspicious or malicious operations such as data theft, system modification, or malicious network activity are evident. The only external data interaction is posting to a provided webhook URL, which is standard for notification systems. There are no signs of hidden backdoors, code injection, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard notification decorator designed for monitoring or logging purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It is safe from a security perspective based on the provided snippet.",
