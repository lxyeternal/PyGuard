  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a decorator that sends notifications at start, success, and failure via webhooks to platforms like Mattermost, Slack, and Discord.\n- It uses external inputs (webhook URL, user_id, platform) but does not store or transmit secrets.\n- The network communication relies on `requests.post`, with error handling.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The code handles exceptions gracefully, sanitizing error messages when needed.\n- The main concern is reliance on external webhook URLs, which could be malicious if compromised, but this is a common pattern in notification systems.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Clear, straightforward notification decorator.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious behavior. Uses external library `requests` appropriately.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard notification utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1 (low risk)\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar notification decorator, with focus on function execution.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, just standard network requests and message formatting.\n- **Concern:** Sending exception details might leak sensitive info, but this is common.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, monitoring function execution.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior. The error message sanitization for SQL errors is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2 (slightly higher, but still low)\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same notification pattern.\n- **Analysis:** Potential risk if webhook URLs are malicious, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as others.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, standard network request.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting minimal external dependency risk but no inherent security issues.\n\n### **Final evaluation:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign notification decorator.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The only potential concern is reliance on external webhook URLs, but this is typical for such utilities and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — minimal, mainly due to external webhook dependency, but not inherently dangerous.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and appropriate for its purpose. The existing report scores are reasonable and should not be adjusted significantly.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is benign and secure within the context of its intended functionality.",
