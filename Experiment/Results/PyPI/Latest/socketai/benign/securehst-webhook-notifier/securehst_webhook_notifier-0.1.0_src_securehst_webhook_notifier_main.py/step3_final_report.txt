{
  "purpose": "A decorator that sends start, success, and error notifications via webhooks to messaging platforms such as Mattermost, Slack, or Discord.",
  "sources": "Function arguments (webhook_url, func_identifier, platform, user_id, custom_message), function call results, exception messages.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to webhook_url, message payloads sent to external messaging platforms.",
  "flows": "Decorator wraps a function; on invocation, sends start message, executes function, then sends success or error message depending on outcome; error messages are sanitized.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. Error sanitization is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard notification decorator with platform-specific message formatting and network requests. It sanitizes SQL error messages to prevent leaks. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External webhook URLs are a potential external risk but are typical for such utilities. The error handling and message formatting are straightforward. The code's logic is clear, and the security implications are minimal, primarily related to trusting external webhook endpoints.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured notification utility for monitoring function execution. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The main external risk pertains to the trustworthiness of webhook URLs, which is outside the code's scope. Overall, the code is safe for use in production environments.",
