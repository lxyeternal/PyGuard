  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator for sending start, success, and error notifications via webhooks for function executions, supporting multiple messaging platforms.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments, and webhook URL, platform, user_id, custom_message parameters.",
  "sinks": "Sends POST requests to the provided webhook URL with formatted messages; uses requests.post for network communication.",
  "flows": "Function execution triggers notification at start; upon completion or exception, sends success or error message via webhook. Error message may include exception details; in case of exception, re-raises error.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets found. No obfuscated code or unusual code constructs. The code handles exceptions gracefully. No suspicious data leaks or backdoors detected. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard webhook notification decorator. It carefully formats messages for different platforms, captures timing info, and handles exceptions. The requests.post call is used to send notifications, with error handling for network issues. No code injections, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The only potential concern is that error messages containing exception details are sent to webhooks, which might leak sensitive information if exceptions contain secrets; however, this is a common practice and not inherently malicious. The overall structure and logic appear safe and intended for notification purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for sending function execution notifications via webhooks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code snippet. It performs standard operations without suspicious or malicious intent.",
