{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator for sending start, end, and error notifications via webhooks for monitoring function executions, supporting multiple messaging platforms.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments, decorator parameters, and the webhook URL string.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP POST requests to webhook URLs with message payloads, which could potentially be misused if URLs are maliciously controlled.",
  "flows": "Decorator captures start time, executes the wrapped function, and depending on success or exception, sends formatted messages to the webhook. In case of exception, it may modify error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. The only notable behavior is the network request to the webhook URL, which is standard for notifications. The code cleans certain error messages, but this is normal error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a webhook notification decorator that reports start, success, and failure events via HTTP POST requests. It supports multiple platforms with appropriate message formatting. Error handling includes sanitizing SQL error messages. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. The webhook URL is externally provided, and the code performs network requests with timeout and error handling, which is typical. No malicious behavior or malicious intent detected. The functionality appears to be for monitoring and logging, not malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard notification decorator for monitoring function execution via webhooks. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates as intended, providing notifications without performing any harmful actions.",
