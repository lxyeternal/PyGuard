{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator for sending start, end, and error notifications via webhooks to messaging platforms (Mattermost, Slack, Discord). It helps monitor function execution with notifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, user_id parameter, webhook_url, and error messages. It also reads system time via datetime.now().",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP POST requests to external webhook URLs using requests.post. Formatting messages based on platform. Raising exceptions on request failure.",
  "flows": "Decorator captures function execution start and end times; sends notification before execution, upon success, and upon exception. Error message is cleaned and formatted, including user mention if provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code's structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated language or misleading variable names. Error message sanitization is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a webhook notification decorator for monitoring function execution. It securely formats and sends messages to specified webhooks without handling sensitive data directly. It uses standard libraries and requests for HTTP communication. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are observed, such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or unauthorized system access. The error message sanitization for SQL errors suggests awareness of sensitive data but is benign. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate monitoring utility for notifying about function execution states via webhooks. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is detected. It employs standard practices for HTTP communication and message formatting. Overall, the code is safe, with low risk of security issues.",
