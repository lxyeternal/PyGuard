{
  "purpose": "To define package metadata for a Python package named 'securehst-webhook-notifier' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The script reads the module name in the setup() call within the 'if __name__ == \"__main__\":' block.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function could potentially execute code related to package installation, but in this context, it only defines metadata without executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input source is the execution trigger in the main block; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "The script is a minimal setup script with no suspicious or unusual code; it contains only standard setup procedures and a comment explaining its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup.py-like file that registers a package with a name 'securehst-webhook-notifier'. It imports setuptools and calls its setup() function with a static name. There are no user inputs, environment variables, or dynamic code execution present. The comments clarify that it's a shim for GitHub detection, and the code does not perform any network activity, file manipulation, or sensitive operations. It appears to be a standard, benign package definition file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign setup script used for package identification and distribution purposes. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are evident in this code.",
