{
  "purpose": "To define setup configuration for a Python package named 'securehst-webhook-notifier'.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'setuptools' module and reads the '__main__' block to execute 'setuptools.setup()'.",
  "sinks": "The 'setuptools.setup()' function could potentially be a sink if it processes untrusted input, but here it uses static parameters only.",
  "flows": "The script executes 'setuptools.setup()' when run directly, with hardcoded package name; no flow from external data sources is present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs. The comment about the shim and build process is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script for a Python package, primarily serving as a build shim for GitHub detection. It imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with a static package name. No untrusted input, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The purpose appears to be legitimate package setup, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It does not process untrusted data, contain secrets, or perform any suspicious actions.",
