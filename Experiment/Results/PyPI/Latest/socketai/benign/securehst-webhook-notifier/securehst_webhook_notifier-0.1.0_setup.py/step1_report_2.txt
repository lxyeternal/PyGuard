{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the Python package 'securehst-webhook-notifier'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports a library and executes a setup function.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function may write files or metadata during package installation, but no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists, as there is no user input or untrusted data processed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual constructs or suspicious behaviors. The comment references a GitHub repository, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup script for Python packaging, importing setuptools and calling setup() with a package name. There are no indicators of malicious activity, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors. The code does not process input, handle credentials, or perform network operations. It appears to be a benign package configuration file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. It solely serves to configure package metadata and does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior.",
