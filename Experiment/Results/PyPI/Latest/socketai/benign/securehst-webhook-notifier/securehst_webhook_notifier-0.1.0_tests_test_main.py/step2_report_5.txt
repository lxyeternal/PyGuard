  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code**:  \n   All reports explicitly state that the code is solely a set of unit tests using standard libraries (pytest, responses, requests). They note no obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic. The code is straightforward, with controlled test data and mock responses.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:  \n   The code appears well-structured for testing webhook functions, with appropriate assertions and exception handling. No logical flaws or security issues are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Issues**:  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which aligns with the analysis. These scores seem reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely for testing and contains no malicious payloads, no elevated risk scores are justified. The environment is controlled, and no external untrusted input is processed in a way that could cause harm.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is zero across all reports, which is correct. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports are cautious and conclude that the code is safe, based on observable facts. No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores and Analysis**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis—no malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks identified; tests are safe and controlled.\n\n### Additional Justification:\nGiven the thorough review and consensus across all reports, the code's purpose is purely to verify webhook functions in a controlled testing environment. There are no signs of supply chain threats, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \n**The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and free of malware. The risk scores should remain at 0 across all categories.**",
