{
  "purpose": "Unit testing the webhook notification functions, including various platform-specific message formatting, error handling, and decorator behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pytest, requests, responses; function definitions for notify_webhook, send_webhook_message; mock webhook URL input; test functions invoking these methods.",
  "sinks": "Webhook URL requests, request bodies containing test messages, error details, and user mentions sent over network via requests.",
  "flows": "Input URL and message parameters flow into send_webhook_message or notify_webhook decorators, which generate request bodies and send them via HTTP POST. Exceptions or errors in test functions produce error messages sent through webhooks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. Use of responses mocking for HTTP responses is standard; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors observed; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs comprehensive unit tests for webhook notification functionalities, including multiple platforms and error scenarios. It uses mocking to simulate network responses, verifies message content and flow, and tests error handling. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or covert activities. All observed behaviors are consistent with standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for webhook notification functions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears well-structured for testing purposes without any suspicious or harmful components.",
