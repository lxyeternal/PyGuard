{
  "purpose": "The code contains unit tests for webhook notification functions, verifying message formatting, error handling, and platform-specific behaviors using mocked network responses.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded webhook URLs, message strings, user IDs, and platform identifiers within test functions.",
  "sinks": "Request bodies sent to mocked webhook URLs; no untrusted data flows to external systems in actual execution.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke send_webhook_message or notify_webhook, which construct request payloads based on input parameters and send to mocked URLs; responses are simulated.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; all data and responses are controlled within tests.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite with controlled inputs, mocking network interactions to verify message formatting, error handling, and platform-specific logic. No external untrusted data, secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The functions tested do not perform any harmful operations, and the environment is isolated. The code does not contain obfuscation or backdoors. All signals indicate a benign, testing-only purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of unit tests for webhook functions with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
