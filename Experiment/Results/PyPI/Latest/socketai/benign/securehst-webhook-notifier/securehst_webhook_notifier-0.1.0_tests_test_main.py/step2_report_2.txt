  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe unit tests for webhook notification functions, utilizing mocking libraries like responses.\n- Inputs are controlled, hardcoded test data.\n- No external untrusted data or secrets are involved.\n- No obfuscated, suspicious, or malicious code patterns are evident.\n- The functions tested are standard, with no signs of backdoors or malicious behavior.\n- The overall security risk is negligible, with malware scores at 0 across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of Issues:** No, the code does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or vulnerable logic.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** The logic and reasoning in the reports are sound; no errors are apparent.\n- **Scores:** The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the controlled test environment and lack of malicious content.\n\n### Specific Observations:\n- The code only performs unit testing with mock data.\n- No external inputs, secrets, or untrusted data are processed.\n- The test functions verify correct message formatting, error handling, and platform-specific behavior.\n- No suspicious network activity or payloads are involved.\n- No signs of supply chain threats or malicious payloads.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- **Malware Score (0):** No malicious code, backdoors, or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score (0):** The tests do not pose security risks; they operate in a controlled environment.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, **the code appears entirely safe**, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate; the code is a standard, safe set of unit tests with no supply chain security concerns.",
