  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no functions, external data sources, data flows, or suspicious operations.\n   - The code is a standard practice in Python packages for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No errors or flaws are present; the code is minimal and correct for its purpose.\n   - The reports are consistent in identifying the code as benign and standard.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0.0 (correct, no obfuscation)\n     - `malware`: 0.0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0.0 (appropriate, no security risk)\n     - `confidence`: 1.0 (justified, clear benign intent)\n   - These scores are reasonable given the simplicity and nature of the code.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code is only a version string assignment, the risk score should remain at 0.0.\n   - Malware score is also correctly at 0.0, as there's no malicious activity or code.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent; they rely on observable code behavior.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's actual content.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Own Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code's simplicity and purpose are well-understood and common in package development.\n- No hidden or malicious logic exists.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports correctly identify the code as benign with appropriate scoring. No adjustments are necessary.",
