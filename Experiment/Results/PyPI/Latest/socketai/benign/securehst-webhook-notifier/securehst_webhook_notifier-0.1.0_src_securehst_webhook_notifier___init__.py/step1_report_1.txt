  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only a version string assignment; no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a string to a variable __version__, which is a common practice for Python packages to specify versioning. There are no functions, data processing, external calls, or embedded code. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious logic, or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves a typical purpose of version declaration, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
