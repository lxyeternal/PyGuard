  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as package metadata.",
  "sources": "N/A (simple assignment, no input sources).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data flow or external output).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow, no external data or untrusted input).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard practice in Python packages for version declaration. It contains only a single assignment statement, with no external calls, data processing, or obfuscation. The code's simplicity and purpose are well-understood, and no malicious or security-sensitive operations are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, securityRisk: 0.0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the code's harmless nature. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
