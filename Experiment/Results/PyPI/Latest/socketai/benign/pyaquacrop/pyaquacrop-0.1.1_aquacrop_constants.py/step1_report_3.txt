  "purpose": "Define constant values for the Aquacrop application, including version date and number.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string and numeric literals to class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with two constant attributes: a date string and a float version number. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no untrusted data handling. The code appears to serve as a configuration or constant holder. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of constants for versioning purposes. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
