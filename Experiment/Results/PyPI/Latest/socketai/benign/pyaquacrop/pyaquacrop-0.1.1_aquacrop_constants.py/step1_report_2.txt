  "purpose": "Define constant version information for a software component named AQUACROP.",
  "sources": "None; the code only assigns string and float values to class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks, outputs, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks exists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated elements, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class with two class attributes holding version information. There are no external input reads, no data processing, no cryptic code, or behavior indicative of malicious intent. It appears to serve as a configuration or constant holder for versioning purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, straightforward, and intended for version tracking. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
