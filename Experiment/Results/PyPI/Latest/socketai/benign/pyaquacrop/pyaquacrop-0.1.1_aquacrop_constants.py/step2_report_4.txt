  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple class with static constants for version info.\n- The code is static, with no input/output, no dynamic behavior, no external data handling.\n- No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is straightforward and typical for configuration or version tracking.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the descriptions; no issues are present in the code itself.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence score of 1 across reports seems justified given the clear benign nature.\n\n**Potential points of critique or considerations:**\n- Since all reports agree, there's no discrepancy in logic or reasoning.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent; the analysis is consistent.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign; no malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and aligned with the code's nature.\n- The analysis correctly dismisses any potential concerns based on the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, since it's just version info, but I might keep it at 0 for simplicity)\n\n**Justification:**  \n- No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no vulnerabilities detected.  \n- The code is purely static, serving as a constants holder, which is standard practice.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The assigned scores are appropriate. No further action needed.",
