  "purpose": "Define static version constants for the project.",
  "sources": "Class attributes AQUACROP_VERSION_DATE and AQUACROP_VERSION_NUMBER",
  "sinks": "None; static data used for configuration purposes",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment only",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static constants with no dynamic or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two static attributes representing version information. It contains no functions, input/output, external data handling, or dynamic behavior. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is a typical constants holder, benign in nature. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or indicators of malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static class defining version information with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
