  "purpose": "Defines a class with constants related to the version information of a software component.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leak or effect.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a class with two class attributes containing version information. There are no functions, no dynamic execution, or external data handling. The version data is hardcoded as strings and numbers, which is typical for constants. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and contains only static constant definitions with no malicious intent or security issues.",
