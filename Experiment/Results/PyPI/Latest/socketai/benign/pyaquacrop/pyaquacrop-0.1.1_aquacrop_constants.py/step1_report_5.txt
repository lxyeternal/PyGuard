  "purpose": "Define version constants for a software component called AQUACROP.",
  "sources": "No input reading or external data sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing paths are present in this static snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple class with two string constants defining version information. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or execute any code that could be malicious. There are no signs of hidden backdoors, malicious intent, or security risks. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python practices for defining constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a versioning reference, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
