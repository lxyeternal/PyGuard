  "purpose": "Defines a class containing version information constants for a software component.",
  "sources": "Class attribute assignments for version date and number.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply static data definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and solely defines a class with two static string/number attributes. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded credentials, nor any indicators of malicious intent. The absence of complex logic, external data handling, or network activity suggests this is benign configuration or version info code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign class defining version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
