{
  "purpose": "Initialize and expose core classes and modules for the AquaCrop Python API wrapper, organizing imports and exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from submodules within aquacrop.entities and the aquacrop.aquacrop module; an import of aquacrop.templates without usage.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network, file, or environment variable operations present.",
  "flows": "Import statements do not involve data flow from untrusted sources; no dynamic execution or data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The import of aquacrop.templates without subsequent usage is unusual but benign; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer that imports core classes and re-exports them via __all__. The only unusual aspect is the import of aquacrop.templates without use, which does not introduce security risks. No network activity, code injection, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The code is clear, readable, and serves solely as an API setup module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The import of aquacrop.templates is likely an oversight or placeholder but does not pose any threat. All scores should reflect this benign assessment.",
