The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.05), justified by the nature of file handling but no malicious intent.

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate and transparent wrapper for AquaCrop, with no active malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the supply chain risk posed by downloading external binaries without verification. Implementing checksum or signature validation would mitigate this risk. Current malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, but the security risk score should be increased to approximately 0.6 to reflect the supply chain vulnerability."
