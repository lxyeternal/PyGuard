{
  "purpose": "A package that overrides the install command to raise an exception, effectively preventing installation as a safeguard or placeholder to avoid dependency confusion or misuse.",
  "sources": "The run() method in the InstallCommand class, which raises RuntimeError; package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "The exception in run() halts installation; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run() method is invoked, which raises an exception, blocking further steps.",
  "anomalies": "Override of the install command to prevent installation is unusual but intentional; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, defines a custom install command that raises an exception to prevent installation, and sets up package metadata. The purpose appears to be a placeholder or security safeguard against dependency confusion. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The exception is a controlled measure, not an attack. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this analysis. The code is straightforward, transparent, and intentionally designed to block installation, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, intentionally designed placeholder package that prevents installation. It contains no malicious code or behavior. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose. No further action is necessary.",
