{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom install command that raises an error to prevent installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from setuptools, class definition, setup() function with package metadata.",
  "sinks": "The run() method in InstallCommand raises RuntimeError, preventing actual installation; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> class definition -> setup() call -> install command executed -> run() method invoked -> exception raised.",
  "anomalies": "The install command is intentionally overridden to raise an exception during installation, which is unusual for typical setup scripts but not malicious. The message suggests this package is a placeholder or a safeguard against accidental installation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and customizes the install command to prevent installation by raising a RuntimeError. The setup() function specifies package metadata and overrides the install command with a class that raises an exception during installation. This pattern is often used as a placeholder or to prevent the package from being installed. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The message indicates a protective measure, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code acts as a safeguard, preventing installation of a placeholder package, likely to prevent dependency confusion or accidental installation. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
