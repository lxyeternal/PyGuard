  "purpose": "Define a placeholder package to prevent dependency confusion attacks for Yandex's sales data application.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package setup parameters and overrides the 'install' command to prevent actual installation.",
  "sinks": "The overridden 'run' method raises a RuntimeError, which is a controlled exception, not a malicious sink.",
  "flows": "When attempting to install, the custom install command triggers and raises an error, preventing actual installation.",
  "anomalies": "The override of the install command to intentionally raise an error is unusual but appears to serve as a safeguard against unintended installation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the 'install' command from setuptools to prevent installation by raising an error during 'run'. This behavior is intentional to serve as a placeholder or safeguard, not malicious. No suspicious data flows, external connections, or obfuscated code are detected. The setup parameters appear standard, and the override is a controlled mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "This code acts as a protective placeholder to prevent the installation of the actual package, likely for security or integrity reasons. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code within the provided snippet.",
