{
  "purpose": "Define a package setup configuration that overrides the default install command to prevent installation and display an error message, serving as a security placeholder.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function call defining package metadata; the 'InstallCommand' class overriding the 'run' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'raise RuntimeError' in the overridden 'run' method which prevents installation; no external data input or output involved.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method is invoked, which raises an error, blocking any further installation steps.",
  "anomalies": "The override of the 'install' command to always raise an exception is unusual; it indicates intentional blocking of package installation, possibly to prevent misuse or dependency confusion.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' modules, defines a custom install command that raises an error to prevent actual installation, and sets up package metadata. The overriding of the 'install' command to always raise a RuntimeError suggests the package is a security placeholder or a safeguard against accidental or malicious installation. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior beyond intentional installation blocking. The code appears straightforward, with a clear security purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This package acts as a placeholder to prevent installation, likely to avoid dependency confusion or misuse. It does not contain malicious code or behaviors but employs an unusual override of the install command for security purposes. No malware or security risks are present beyond intentional blocking of installation.",
