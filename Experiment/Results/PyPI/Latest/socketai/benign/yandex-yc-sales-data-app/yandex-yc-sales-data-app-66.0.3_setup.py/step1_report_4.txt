  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration that intentionally prevents installation by raising an exception during the install process.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function and the 'InstallCommand' class, particularly the 'run' method that raises an exception.",
  "sinks": "The 'run' method that raises RuntimeError; this stops the installation process and outputs an error message.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom 'install' command is invoked, executing 'run()' which raises an exception and halts the process.",
  "anomalies": "The install command intentionally raises an exception to prevent installation, which is unusual for a standard package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a package named 'yandex-yc-sales-data-app' with standard metadata. A custom 'InstallCommand' class overrides the 'run' method to raise a RuntimeError, effectively preventing installation and informing the user that this is a placeholder package. This behavior indicates the package is a security or placeholder package meant to block accidental or malicious installation. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The use of a custom install command to block installation is unusual but not malicious; it appears to be an intentional safeguard or placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a placeholder package designed to prevent installation by raising an exception during setup. It does not contain malicious behavior but is intentionally blocking usage, possibly to prevent dependency confusion or unauthorized installation. No malicious activity or malware is present.",
