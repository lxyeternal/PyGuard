  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration that overrides the install command to prevent installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools and the custom InstallCommand class definition.",
  "sinks": "The run method in the InstallCommand class raises a RuntimeError to block installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the overridden run method is invoked, which raises an exception to prevent further execution.",
  "anomalies": "The run method does not perform any malicious action; it only raises an exception to block installation. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior detected. The package appears to be a placeholder to prevent installation, possibly as a security measure against dependency confusion or misuse.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a custom install command class that raises a RuntimeError when run, effectively blocking installation attempts. The setup function uses this custom command to override the default install behavior. The package is labeled as a placeholder with a specific purpose to prevent dependency confusion attacks. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code's purpose seems to be to act as a safeguard rather than to execute harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a security placeholder package designed to prevent installation, likely as a protective measure. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It is intentionally blocking installation to avoid dependency confusion or misuse. Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious.",
