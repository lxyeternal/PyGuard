  "purpose": "Define data models for ABI components using Pydantic for validation and structure.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and type annotations within the code, primarily static data declarations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing present; the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; the code only establishes data schemas without execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Pydantic model class definitions representing ABI structures, with no executable logic, external interactions, or dynamic code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The use of list[Type] syntax assumes Python 3.9+, which is standard. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The scores are consistent with the code's nature, and no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, declarative set of data models for ABI representation, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The assessments and scores are appropriate and require no modification.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
