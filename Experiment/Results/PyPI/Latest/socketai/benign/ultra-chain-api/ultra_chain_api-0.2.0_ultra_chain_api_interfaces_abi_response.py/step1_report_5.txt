  "purpose": "Define data models for ABI (Application Binary Interface) structures used in blockchain or smart contract systems.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; only class definitions and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations, as this code only declares data models.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward data model definitions using Pydantic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple Pydantic BaseModel subclasses defining data structures for ABI components such as Fields, Structs, Actions, Tables, and the main Abi and AbiResponse containers. All classes are simple data containers with explicit type annotations, and no runtime logic, input handling, or external data processing is present. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be purely declarative, intended for data validation and serialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of data models with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It solely defines structures for representing ABI data in a typed manner. No security threats or malware are present.",
