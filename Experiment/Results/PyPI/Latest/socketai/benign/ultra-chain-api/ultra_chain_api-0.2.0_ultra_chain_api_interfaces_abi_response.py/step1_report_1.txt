  "purpose": "Define data models for ABI-related entities using Pydantic for data validation.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains class definitions and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "None; purely declarative model definitions without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed. Use of type hints and Pydantic models is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data model definitions with Pydantic, including classes for Field, Struct, Action, Table, Abi, and AbiResponse. All classes are straightforward data containers with no executable logic, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. No input/output, environment variables, or network activities are present. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of data models for representing ABI structures, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
