  "purpose": "Define data models for representing blockchain ABI (Application Binary Interface) structures using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; static class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; code is purely data model definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code contains straightforward Pydantic model declarations with no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of several Pydantic models defining data structures for ABI components, including fields, structs, actions, tables, and the overall ABI response. No input/output operations, environment variable usages, or code execution features are present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected. The models are static and serve as data schemas.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely declarative data models for ABI representations with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious behaviors or malicious code segments.",
