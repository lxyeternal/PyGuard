  "purpose": "Define data models for ABI (Application Binary Interface) components using Pydantic for data validation and structure in Python.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, input or data reading; all definitions are static class models.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code purely defines data structures without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard Pydantic models with straightforward type annotations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes structured data models for ABI components, including classes for Field, Struct, Action, Table, and the overarching Abi and AbiResponse. It employs Pydantic for data validation. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious logic present. The use of list[Type] syntax assumes Python 3.9+ compatibility but is otherwise standard. No evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines data models for ABI-related structures and does not contain malicious code or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward, secure implementation of data validation models.",
