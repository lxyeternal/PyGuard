  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior:**\n- The code is purely composed of import statements from the 'ultra_chain_api' package.\n- No functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The comment `# ruff: noqa: F401` indicates suppression of linter warnings about unused imports, which is common in modular or scaffolded code.\n\n**2. Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is only import statements with no immediate malicious activity.\n- Several reports mention the suppression comment `noqa: F401` as potentially hiding unused or malicious code, but in this context, it's standard practice.\n- No report points out any actual anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns beyond the suppression comment, which is benign here.\n\n**3. Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the straightforward import statements.\n- Confidence levels are high (~0.8-1), consistent with the clear and benign nature of the code.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- No issues justify high risk scores; the code is static imports with no active behavior.\n- The low security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n**5. Malware Score Consideration:**\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n**6. Assumptions About Vulnerabilities:**\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the reports correctly state that these are benign import statements.\n- The suppression comment is noted but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- All scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are justified based on the clear, static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to suppression comment)  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard set of import statements from a blockchain API library. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The suppression comment is typical and does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed to the scores. The reports are accurate, and the code poses no security concern.",
