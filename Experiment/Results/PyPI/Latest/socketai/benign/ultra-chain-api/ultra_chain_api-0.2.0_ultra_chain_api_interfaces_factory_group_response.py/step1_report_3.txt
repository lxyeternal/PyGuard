  "purpose": "Define a data model for factory group responses using Pydantic's BaseModel.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; the code defines a class structure.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or stored; class attributes are simple data fields.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only declares a data model.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pydantic for data validation and defines a class 'FactoryGroupResponse' with various typed fields. All fields are straightforward data types (int, str, list[int]) with no input handling, no external data sources, and no code execution or network activity. No malicious or suspicious behavior is apparent. The code's structure is standard for a data model definition in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple Pydantic data model definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.",
