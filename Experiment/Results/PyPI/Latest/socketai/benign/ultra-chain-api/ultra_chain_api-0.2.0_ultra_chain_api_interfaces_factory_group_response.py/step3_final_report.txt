  "purpose": "Define a data schema for factory group responses using Pydantic BaseModel with fields: id, manager, uri, hash, factories, uos_payment.",
  "sources": "None; static class definition with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; purely declarative data model.",
  "anomalies": "None; no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static Pydantic model with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0 are appropriate. Security risk scores of 0 or 0.1 are acceptable given the code's simplicity; however, a score of 0 would be more precise. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code poses no security threat, and the scores reflect this accurately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe data schema with no malicious or obfuscating elements. The reports are consistent and justified. The current scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and risk 0 or 0.1 are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
