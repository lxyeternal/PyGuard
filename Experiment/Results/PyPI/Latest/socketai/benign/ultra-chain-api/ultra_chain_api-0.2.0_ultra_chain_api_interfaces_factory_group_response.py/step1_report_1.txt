  "purpose": "Define a data model for FactoryGroupResponse using Pydantic BaseModel for data validation.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; data fields are statically defined as class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no processing of untrusted data beyond data validation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; class is a static schema definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward, defining a data schema with no dynamic execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Pydantic's BaseModel to create a schema class 'FactoryGroupResponse' with several fields, including 'id', 'manager', 'uri', 'hash', 'factories', and 'uos_payment'. All fields are basic data types. The code performs standard schema definition without dynamic code execution, external data handling, or obfuscated logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The use of Pydantic for data validation is common and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple data schema definition with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Overall, it is safe.",
