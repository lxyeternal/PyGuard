{
  "purpose": "Defines a data model for Factory Group response data using Pydantic BaseModel.",
  "sources": "Input data for the FactoryGroupResponse model, typically from external sources such as API requests or data files.",
  "sinks": "Data serialization, validation, or storage mechanisms that process instances of FactoryGroupResponse.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the FactoryGroupResponse constructor, then potentially to storage or API response layers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Pydantic's BaseModel to define a structured data model with specific fields. It uses standard type annotations and does not contain any code that reads or writes external data directly, nor does it perform any operations beyond data structure definition. No apparent security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be a straightforward data schema for API responses.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign data model definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It serves to validate and structure data for responses related to factory groups.",
