  "purpose": "Define a data model for factory group response using Pydantic for validation and serialization.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code defines a class with static type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only static attribute definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward class definition without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Pydantic's BaseModel and defines a class with several fields of specified types, including list of integers. No input handling, external data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. The class appears to be a simple schema for data validation or serialization, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data model definition with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It does not contain any suspicious behavior or supply chain risks.",
