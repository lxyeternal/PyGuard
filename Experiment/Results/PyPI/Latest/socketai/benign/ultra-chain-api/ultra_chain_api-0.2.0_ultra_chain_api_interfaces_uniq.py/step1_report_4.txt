{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for storing information related to a unique entity, likely used for data validation and serialization.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions and imports; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output operations present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only defines a model schema.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and standard for Pydantic model definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a Pydantic data model with several fields, some optional. There are no functions, no data processing, no external I/O, and no dynamic code execution. The fields suggest data storage purposes, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The structure is typical for validation schemas, and no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data model definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves to validate and structure data related to a 'Uniq' entity without any harmful or suspicious behavior.",
