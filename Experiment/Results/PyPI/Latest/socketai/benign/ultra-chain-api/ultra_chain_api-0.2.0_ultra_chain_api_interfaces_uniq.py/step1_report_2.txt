{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for an entity with specific attributes, likely for validation or serialization purposes.",
  "sources": "The class attributes and their annotations define data sources, such as input data to be validated or serialized.",
  "targets": "The code does not include sinks that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only defines a data model without processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected. The code is a straightforward use of Pydantic for data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for type hinting and validation (typing.Optional, pydantic.BaseModel). It defines a class 'Uniq' with several fields, including integers, strings, floats, and optional strings. The model appears to be for data validation or serialization, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or external data handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data model definition for data validation purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain security risks, or suspicious code segments. It appears safe and intentionally designed for schema validation.",
