  "purpose": "Data model definition for Uniq with various fields, used for validation and serialization.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes defining data fields; no external data sources or input handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process or output data dynamically.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; purely declarative data schema.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple Pydantic data model with static fields. No dynamic code, external interactions, or malicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security issues or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the static and transparent structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data schema with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
