{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for resale share and factory response, primarily for data validation and structure.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; fields are assigned directly within class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; purely declarative models.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing logic; models serve as schemas.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Optional[Any] in multiple fields introduces permissiveness but not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward Pydantic models with no executable logic, network calls, or data processing. The use of 'Any' in optional fields could allow flexible data input, which might be misused in a broader context, but within this snippet, it does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The models are standard for data validation in asset or blockchain-related applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard data schema definitions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minimal security risk score reflects the permissiveness of 'Any' fields but does not imply malicious activity.",
