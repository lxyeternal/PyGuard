{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for resale shares and factory responses using Pydantic, likely for validating structured data in an application.",
  "sources": "Input data to the models, potentially from external sources such as API requests or data files.",
  "sinks": "None directly; models are for data validation and storage, not executing untrusted code or data processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs into model instances, but no processing or transformations are performed that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of Optional[Any] and list typing is standard but could be improved for stricter validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard validation library (pydantic) and typing. Defines two data models with various fields, some optional. No dynamic code execution, no network access, no file operations, and no handling of untrusted data within this snippet. The models are straightforward and primarily serve as schemas. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malware patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of data models for structured data validation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a typical part of a larger application. The overall security risk is minimal.",
