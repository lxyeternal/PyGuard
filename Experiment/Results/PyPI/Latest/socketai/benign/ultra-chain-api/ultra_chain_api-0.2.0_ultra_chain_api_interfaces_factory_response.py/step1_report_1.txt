{
  "purpose": "Define data models for resale share and factory response information, likely used in a blockchain or asset management system.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines data structures without external data input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code purely defines data models.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The models include optional fields with generic types such as Any, which could potentially be used maliciously if misused, but their presence alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code uses Pydantic for data validation with clearly defined models. All fields are standard data types or optional types. There is no code execution, network communication, or handling of sensitive data within this snippet. The use of 'Any' in optional fields may warrant validation elsewhere but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure appears typical for data serialization in an API or blockchain context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data model definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a safe, standard implementation for managing asset-related data.",
