  "purpose": "A Python client for interacting with Ultra blockchain API endpoints, fetching chain info, account data, blocks, transactions, and other blockchain data.",
  "sources": "API responses from requests to various endpoints, user-provided parameters such as account names, block IDs, and request data in POST calls.",
  "sinks": "Parsed JSON responses mapped into data models; no untrusted code execution or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Network requests from _get and _post methods to API endpoints, responses parsed into data models; no data flows into insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. URLs are static and predefined. Recursive get_uniqs is standard pagination.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client with proper error handling, static URLs, and no dynamic code execution. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The network interactions are with known, static endpoints. Response parsing is safe, and no untrusted data is executed or leaked. The recursive get_uniqs method is a common pattern for paginated data retrieval and does not pose security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client for Ultra blockchain with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified and align with the analysis.",
