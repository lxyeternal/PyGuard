  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details provided and applying a critical security perspective.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward API client for Ultra blockchain, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors. URLs are static, and response handling is proper. The confidence is high (0.9), and malware is scored at 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the benign nature of the code. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate. Security risk is low (0.2), consistent with a standard API client.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code makes standard HTTP requests to known endpoints, with no obfuscation or suspicious activity. URLs are static, and exception handling is proper.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's structure. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is justified. Security risk remains low (0.2).\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical API client, making network requests with no signs of malicious intent. Recursive `get_uniqs` is standard for pagination and does not indicate malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The recursive method could be scrutinized for potential performance issues, but not for security. No malicious code or obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware remains at 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API wrapper with proper response handling. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code. No signs of malware or sabotage.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is correct. Security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a well-structured API client, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. All endpoints are static and known.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's confidence is high, and the assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, which is consistent; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a low risk score (~0.2) is appropriate, reflecting standard API client behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n\n**Security Risk Score:** **0.2** — standard API client, minimal security risk, mainly due to external dependencies and endpoints, but nothing suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-implemented API client for Ultra blockchain, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
