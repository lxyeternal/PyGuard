{
  "purpose": "Data models for blockchain account, permission, and resource management, primarily used for data validation and serialization.",
  "sources": "Fields such as 'permission', 'keys', 'accounts', 'waits', 'linked_actions', and resource limits that read or hold data, often from external sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows into models via 'Any' typed fields, which could lead to security issues if misused downstream, but within this code, no direct sinks are executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input into model fields like 'keys', 'waits', 'permissions', and resource limits; no dynamic execution or external calls are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Any' types in multiple fields; no code obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Pydantic data schemas for blockchain account and permission data. No functions, dynamic code, or logic are present. The use of 'Any' introduces flexibility but not malicious intent. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident within this snippet. The models are straightforward and serve as data validation schemas. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The risk score is minimal (around 0.1-0.2), mainly due to potential misuse of 'Any' fields if used improperly elsewhere, but not within this code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of data models for blockchain account management with no malicious or obfuscated features. The low risk score is justified given its schema-only nature. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security issues is present.",
