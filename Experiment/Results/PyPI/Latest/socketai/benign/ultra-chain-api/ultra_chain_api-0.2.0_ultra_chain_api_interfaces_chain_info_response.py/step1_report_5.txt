  "sources": "Class attribute definitions that specify data types for each field.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; it's a static data model.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Pydantic BaseModel class defining various string and integer fields related to blockchain info. It contains only data structure definitions with no logic, input handling, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign data model for organizing blockchain response data. It poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
