  "purpose": "Define a data schema for blockchain chain information response using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes defining fields such as server_version, chain_id, block numbers, block IDs, timestamps, producer info, and limits.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code is purely declarative with no data input/output handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing; the class serves as a data container without logic or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static Pydantic model defining blockchain response data fields. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or malicious code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data schema with no security risks or malicious intent. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The assessments are accurate and do not require modification.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
