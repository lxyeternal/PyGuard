{
  "purpose": "Defines a data model for representing blockchain chain information responses using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the class attributes, which are intended to hold response data for blockchain info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process or output untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow, as this is a data model definition without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pydantic for data validation and defines a class with multiple fields representing blockchain info. All fields are straightforward and typed, with no logic, input/output handling, or dynamic behavior. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or unusual constructs. It appears to be a standard data schema used in API responses.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Pydantic model for blockchain response data with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It functions as a data schema without executing any untrusted or suspicious actions.",
