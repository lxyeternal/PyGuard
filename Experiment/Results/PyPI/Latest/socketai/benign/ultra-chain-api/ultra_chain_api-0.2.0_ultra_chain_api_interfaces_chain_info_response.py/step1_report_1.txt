{
  "purpose": "Defines a data model for response data related to blockchain or chain information using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines a data class with static fields.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output operations, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as there are no input/output or external data interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Pydantic and defines a subclass of BaseModel with various data fields representing chain info. It is a straightforward data structure with no dynamic code, external inputs, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. The fields suggest this model is intended for serializing blockchain or node status information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Pydantic model for representing chain info data, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is safe and appears purely for data validation or serialization purposes.",
