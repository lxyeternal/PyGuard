{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for chain information response using Pydantic for validation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines a class with fixed attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the class does not process or handle untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines a data schema.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pydantic and defines a subclass of BaseModel with multiple attributes related to blockchain chain info. All fields are straightforward type annotations with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or insecure patterns. The code serves as a simple schema definition without side effects or malicious code. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent. The structure is clean and standard for Pydantic models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Pydantic data model for blockchain chain information. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured schema definition.",
