  "purpose": "Define data models for blockchain transaction and block data using Pydantic for validation and structure.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data models define data structure expected from blockchain responses.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, input, or output mechanisms present that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; models are purely structural definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard data modeling with Pydantic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Pydantic models to represent blockchain transaction data. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are present. All classes are straightforward data containers for serialization/deserialization purposes. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic detected. The models include typical fields for blockchain data such as transaction IDs, signatures, and block information, with no signs of malicious payloads or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data structure definitions for blockchain data, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard modeling code for blockchain data validation.",
