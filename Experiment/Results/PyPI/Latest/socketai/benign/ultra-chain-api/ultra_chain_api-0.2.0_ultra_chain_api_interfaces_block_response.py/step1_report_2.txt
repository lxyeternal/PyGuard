  "purpose": "Define data models for blockchain transaction and block data structures using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Data inputs come from external JSON payloads representing blockchain data; no direct data input reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this code; it primarily defines data schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code strictly models data structures with no dynamic execution or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes Pydantic to define schema models for various blockchain transaction and block components. It includes nested data structures, type annotations, and standard data validation constructs. There are no functions, external data handling, or execution logic that could pose security risks. The code appears purely declarative, serving as data structure definitions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward schema definition using Pydantic for blockchain-related data. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The structure is clean and appropriate for its purpose, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
