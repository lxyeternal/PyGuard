{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pydantic data models representing blockchain transactions, blocks, and related structures, serving as schemas for validation and serialization without executing logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from external sources when deserialized into these models, such as blockchain API responses or user input.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could be deserialized into these models, but the models themselves do not process or execute code, so no direct sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs into model deserialization; models then serve as structured representations but do not process data further within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward data schema definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Pydantic model definitions for blockchain data structures, with no functions, dynamic code, or external interactions. The models are standard, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The use of 'Any' types is typical for flexible schemas. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or code injection points are present. The models serve as data validation schemas, and their benign nature is consistent across multiple reviews. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of blockchain data schemas with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
