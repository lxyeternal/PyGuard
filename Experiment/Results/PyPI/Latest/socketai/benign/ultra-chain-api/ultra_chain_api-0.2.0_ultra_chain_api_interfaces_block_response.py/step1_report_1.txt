  "purpose": "Define data models for blockchain transaction and block data using Pydantic for validation and serialization.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; models are used for data validation and serialization.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; models are data structures used within an application context.",
  "flows": "Data flows through instances of these models within the application, no external or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Pydantic model definitions for blockchain data structures such as blocks, transactions, actions, and related entities. It primarily serves as a schema for data validation and serialization. No input/output operations, network communications, or sensitive data handling are present within this code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The models are straightforward and aligned with standard blockchain data representations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data schema definitions using Pydantic, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign data validation layer for blockchain data processing.",
