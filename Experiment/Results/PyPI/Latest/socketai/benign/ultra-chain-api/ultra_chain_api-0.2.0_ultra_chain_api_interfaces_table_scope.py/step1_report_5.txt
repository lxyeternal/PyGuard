  "purpose": "Define data models for structured API responses using Pydantic",
  "sources": "Data is received via the instantiation of these models with external input (e.g., API data)",
  "sinks": "Potentially any application code that consumes these models and handles their data",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., JSON) -> Model instantiation -> Usage in application logic",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Pydantic models for response data, with a base class and a derived class adding an extra field. The use of List[Any] is flexible but not inherently suspicious. There are no functions, external calls, or dynamic code execution present. The code appears to be straightforward data model definitions for structured API responses, with no indication of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, legitimate definition of response models without any signs of malware or security issues. It is safe and does not pose a supply chain risk.",
