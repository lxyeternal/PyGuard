{
  "purpose": "Define data models for API responses using Pydantic, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class attributes 'rows', 'more', and 'next_key'. No external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attribute definitions to serialization/deserialization via Pydantic, with no external or dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard use of Pydantic models and 'Any' in 'rows'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Pydantic models for API response structures, with 'rows' as a list of any data, 'more' as a boolean, and 'next_key' as a string. No external calls, dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The use of 'Any' is broad but not malicious; it could pose downstream validation concerns but not security risks within this snippet. The code is simple, clear, and aligns with standard practices for data modeling. No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of data models for API responses with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low at 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk. Overall, it poses no supply chain security concerns.",
