{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for table response structures using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from external sources or API responses to populate these models.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, untrusted data could be assigned to 'rows', 'more', or 'next_key' fields, which could influence downstream processing.",
  "flows": "External data input -> assigned to model fields -> used in application logic or API responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The models are standard data containers.",
  "analysis": "The code uses Pydantic for data validation and serialization, defining two classes: BaseTableResponse and TableResponse. 'rows' is a list of Any type, which is flexible but could be risky if used improperly downstream. 'more' is a boolean indicating additional data. 'next_key' is a string, presumably for pagination. There are no external calls, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated or suspicious patterns, and no hardcoded secrets. The structure appears to be a straightforward data model definition with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data models for API responses with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware. The overall security risk is minimal.",
