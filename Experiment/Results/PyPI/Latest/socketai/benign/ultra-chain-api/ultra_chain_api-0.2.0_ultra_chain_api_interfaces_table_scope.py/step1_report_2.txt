  "purpose": "Define data models for tabular response data using Pydantic for data validation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code imports from pydantic and typing modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that handle untrusted data; purely data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Pydantic models: BaseTableResponse and TableResponse, which extend each other to structure response data with 'rows', 'more', and 'next_key' fields. There is no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external interaction. The usage of List[Any] indicates flexibility but no malicious intent. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be standard model definitions for API responses.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, non-malicious definition of data models with no signs of malware or security risks. It serves a typical purpose in API response structuring and does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
