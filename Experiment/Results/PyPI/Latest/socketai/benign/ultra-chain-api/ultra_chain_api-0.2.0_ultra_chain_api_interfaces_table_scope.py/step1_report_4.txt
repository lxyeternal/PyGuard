{
  "purpose": "Define data models for tabular response data using Pydantic for validation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown; the models are used for serializing/deserializing data, likely from API requests or responses.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are explicitly present in this code; it primarily defines data structures.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet; the models may be used elsewhere in the application.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard Pydantic models.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines a base response model with a list of any type and a boolean, then extends it with an additional string attribute. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no insecure practices evident in this fragment. Usage of 'Any' in a data model is broad but not inherently malicious; it indicates flexibility rather than a security risk. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of data models for API responses, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and typical for a backend application dealing with tabular data responses.",
