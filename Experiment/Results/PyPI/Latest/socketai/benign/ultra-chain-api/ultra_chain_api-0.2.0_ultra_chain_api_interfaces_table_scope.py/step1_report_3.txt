{
  "purpose": "Define response data models for tabular data with pagination information using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Imports from pydantic and typing modules; class attributes for data storage.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines data models.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines two data classes inheriting from Pydantic's BaseModel. These classes specify data structures with list and string attributes for handling tabular data responses and pagination. No dynamic code execution, no data manipulation, and no external data handling are present. The code serves as a simple data schema definition without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data models using Pydantic with no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It is a straightforward, safe schema definition for API responses.",
