{
  "purpose": "A simple FastAPI health check server that responds with status ok",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (--host and --port), imported modules (uvicorn, argparse), FastAPI framework",
  "sinks": "uvicorn.run() invocation, which starts the server with specified host and port",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are used to configure server host and port; these are passed directly to uvicorn.run()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, no malicious logic, and no obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code imports FastAPI and sets up a simple health endpoint. The main() function uses argparse to accept host and port parameters, then runs the server with uvicorn. All inputs are via command-line arguments with default safe values. There are no suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code follows standard patterns for a lightweight web service, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a health check server with configurable host and port. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It appears safe for use.",
