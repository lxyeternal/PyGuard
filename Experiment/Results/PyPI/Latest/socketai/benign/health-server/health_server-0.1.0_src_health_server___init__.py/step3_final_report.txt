  "purpose": "A simple FastAPI health check server with configurable host and port via command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments '--host' and '--port' used to configure uvicorn server parameters.",
  "sinks": "uvicorn.run() invocation with user-supplied host and port; no untrusted data processing or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> argparse parsing -> uvicorn.run(host=..., port=...)",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard implementation of a health check API using FastAPI. It accepts configuration parameters via command-line arguments, which are passed directly to uvicorn without validation or processing of untrusted data. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling. The security implications of passing host and port are minimal, as they are standard configuration options and do not introduce vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and clarity support a low malware and obfuscation score, with a very low security risk score justified by the lack of vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward FastAPI health check server with configurable host and port. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
