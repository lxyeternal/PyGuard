{
  "purpose": "To create and run a simple FastAPI health check server that responds with status 'ok'.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from command-line arguments '--host' and '--port' used to configure server runtime.",
  "sinks": "The uvicorn.run function uses user-provided host and port, which could potentially be misconfigured, but does not pose a direct security risk here.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments (--host, --port) flow into uvicorn.run, configuring server settings; no other data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports FastAPI and uvicorn to set up a basic health endpoint. The command-line parser allows user to specify host and port, which are passed directly to uvicorn. The server simply responds with a fixed JSON message. No input validation or sanitation concerns arise since the arguments are passed directly to uvicorn, which handles them appropriately. There are no code injection points, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified. The structure is straightforward and consistent with common FastAPI deployment scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a minimal FastAPI health check server without any suspicious or malicious code. It accepts runtime configuration via command-line arguments, which is typical for deployment scripts. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
