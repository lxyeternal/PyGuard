{
  "purpose": "A simple health check server built with FastAPI that responds with a status message.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments (--host, --port) parsed via argparse.",
  "sinks": "Data passed to uvicorn.run(), which starts the server with specified host and port; no untrusted data directly influences system commands or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments flow from argparse to uvicorn.run() to configure server parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of standard libraries and clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal FastAPI application with a single endpoint /health. It includes a main() function that uses argparse to accept host and port parameters, then runs uvicorn with those parameters. No user input is executed as code or used insecurely. The server parameters are derived solely from command-line arguments with defaults. The code does not contain any hidden or obfuscated components. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward implementation of a health check endpoint.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple health check server with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with no suspicious data flows or anomalies.",
