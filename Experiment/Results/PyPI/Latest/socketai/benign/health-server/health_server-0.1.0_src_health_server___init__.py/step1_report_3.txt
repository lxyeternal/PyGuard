{
  "purpose": "A simple health check API server built with FastAPI, intended to respond with a status message.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for host and port, imported modules (uvicorn, argparse)",
  "sinks": "uvicorn.run() function which starts the server with specified host and port",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments → uvicorn.run() → server start process",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal FastAPI application with a single GET endpoint /health that returns a simple status. The main() function uses argparse to parse command-line parameters for host and port, then runs the server using uvicorn. No user input or untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to security issues. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or unusual behaviors are present. The structure is typical for a lightweight server application. The command-line interface allows flexibility but does not introduce security risks by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a health check API server with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data in a harmful way, nor does it contain suspicious or malicious code. Overall, it appears safe.",
