{
  "purpose": "To create a simple health check API server using FastAPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments (--host and --port) for server configuration.",
  "sinks": "The uvicorn.run() function executes with user-provided host and port, potentially allowing network configuration manipulation.",
  "flows": "User inputs via command-line arguments flow into uvicorn.run() to configure server binding.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscation, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a minimal FastAPI application with a health endpoint. It uses argparse to accept host and port parameters, which are then used to run the server via uvicorn. The inputs are controlled via command-line, and there are no dynamic evaluations or external data sources involved. The code performs standard server setup without any suspicious or malicious logic. The use of command-line args for server configuration is typical and poses no security risk in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward FastAPI health check server with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It allows configurable network binding via command-line arguments, which is standard practice. No signs of malware or security issues are present.",
