  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no malicious code, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (not explicitly given but implied as minimal risk).\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, reading static files, parsing with regex, dynamically importing version.py — all standard for setup scripts. No external network or untrusted input processing. The license and comments are informational.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on dynamic import of version.py, which is standard but could be risky if the file is malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (implied).\n- **Assessment:** Dynamic import is common in setup scripts; the risk is minimal unless the version.py is compromised. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores seem appropriate; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with a note that the dynamic import could be risky if version.py is tampered with.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, risk=0.5.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score due to dynamic import, but still standard practice. No actual malicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable; no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same general assessment; standard setup script, safe file reads, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as others; no suspicious behavior, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Malicious Behavior:** None detected. The code only reads local files, parses documentation, and dynamically loads a version file — all standard in setup scripts.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Level:** The only minor concern is the dynamic import of version.py, which could be risky if the file is malicious, but in controlled package environments, this is common practice and generally safe.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, due to dynamic import, but standard practice)\n\n**My recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard setup script)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical, well-structured setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The dynamic import, while slightly risky if the version.py is compromised, is a common pattern and does not constitute malicious activity in this context.\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that the version.py and other documentation files are secured and tamper-proof to mitigate any potential risks associated with dynamic imports.",
