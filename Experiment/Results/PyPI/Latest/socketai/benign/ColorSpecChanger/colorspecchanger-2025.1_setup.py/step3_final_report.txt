  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project, reading documentation, version info, and configuring installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads description.asciidoc, README.rst, requirements.txt, and dynamically loads version.py.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or data leaks; only local file reads and module import.",
  "flows": "Reads static files; imports version.py; passes data to setuptools.setup() without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import of version.py, which could be risky if the file is malicious, but this is standard in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script with no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code. The dynamic import of version.py is typical but could be a vector if the file is compromised. No external network activity or untrusted data processing is present. The license and comments are informational. Overall, the script appears benign, with minimal security risk primarily associated with trusting the version.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The minor concern regarding dynamic import is acceptable in controlled environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1).",
