{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package information for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package description from a .asciidoc file, reads README and requirements files, and loads version info from a version.py module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input is processed; no data is sent or written externally outside standard file reading.",
  "flows": "File reads source data (description, version, requirements) without processing untrusted external input; data flows are limited to internal reads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic module loading via importlib.util.spec_from_file_location and load_module, which could be misused if malicious code exists in version.py, but standard for version retrieval. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script functions primarily as a package setup script, retrieving description, version, and requirements, and configuring setup() parameters. It uses safe file operations, and dynamic module loading is standard for version extraction. No suspicious or malicious code segments, no external network calls, or backdoors detected. The license and copyright notices are informational and do not impact security. The script relies on external files (description.asciidoc, README.rst, requirements.txt), which appear to be standard documentation files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates within expected parameters for package distribution setup.",
