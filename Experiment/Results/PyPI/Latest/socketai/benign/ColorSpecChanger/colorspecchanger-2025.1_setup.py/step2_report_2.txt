  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The script is a typical setup script with no malicious behavior, no untrusted data processing, and standard practices.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious code or external connections are detected. The confidence is high (1).  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the report's conclusion.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard dynamic module loading for version info, which is common in setup scripts. No malicious activity or suspicious code detected.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is solid; dynamic import is standard in such scripts, and no external network activity or obfuscation is present.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified; no security issues identified.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Again, a standard setup script with similar features. Slight mention of potential concern over dynamic import, but deemed safe.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is cautious but reasonable; dynamic import is typical for version extraction, and no malicious code is evident.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — slightly elevated but still low; justified given the dynamic import, but not a security concern here.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, no suspicious patterns, no external network activity, safe practices.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to others, straightforward package setup code, no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is thorough and accurate.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate. The code is standard and does not contain malicious payloads or behaviors.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or suspicious behaviors, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is justified. Slightly elevated risk in some reports (0.2) is reasonable due to dynamic import, but still low.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.  \n- **Risk:** **0** — the code is a standard setup script with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign setup script for Python packaging. It reads static files, performs standard operations, and uses common practices. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that the external files (like `version.py`, documentation, etc.) are secure and untampered, but based on the code itself, there are no issues.",
