  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing their conclusions with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, code is standard setup script, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, which is appropriate given the findings.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified by thorough reasoning.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup code, dynamic import of version.py is typical.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, justified by detailed reasoning.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Also a standard setup script, mentions dynamic module loading but no malicious intent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — slightly elevated but justified if considering the potential risk of dynamic import if version.py were compromised.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, reasonable given the cautious stance.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Code Behavior & Data Flows:** All reports correctly identify that the script reads static files, uses standard practices, and does not perform any network activity, external data processing, or code obfuscation.\n- **Dynamic Import of version.py:** While dynamic import can be risky if the file is malicious, in the context of a controlled setup environment, this is standard practice. No evidence suggests tampering or malicious code in version.py.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Security Risks:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.2), likely due to the dynamic import, but overall minimal risk given the context.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0. Given the code's nature, no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the dynamic import, a small risk score (e.g., 0.1–0.2) is justified but not higher, as the code appears standard and controlled.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the dynamic import, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, well-structured setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, with a very low risk score reflecting the minimal potential concern of dynamic module loading in a trusted environment.",
