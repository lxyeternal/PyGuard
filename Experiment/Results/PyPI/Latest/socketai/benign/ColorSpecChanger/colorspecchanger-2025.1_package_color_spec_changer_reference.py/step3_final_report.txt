  "purpose": "Color format conversion and parsing utility functions for handling various color representations and formats.",
  "sources": "String inputs representing colors in hex, function-based, or numerical tuple formats; regex matches for function parsing.",
  "sinks": "Formatted color strings; no external data or system interactions; no data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input color strings or tuples → parsing/regex matching → conversion calculations → formatted output strings or tuples.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual control flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard color format conversions, parsing hex strings, function strings, and numerical tuples. It uses regex matching and mathematical conversions without external system calls or network activity. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions are well-structured, with clear logic aligned with their purpose. The security implications are minimal, and the code is a benign utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward color conversion utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The current malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
