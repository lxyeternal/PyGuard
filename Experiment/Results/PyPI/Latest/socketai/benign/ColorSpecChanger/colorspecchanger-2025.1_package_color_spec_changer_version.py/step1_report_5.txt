  "purpose": "Provide licensing and attribution information for the software package.",
  "sources": "Reading license notices, copyright information, contributor details, and version information embedded in comments and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or external data processing present that could lead to data leakage or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "N/A - all data is static comments and metadata; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. All content appears to be standard licensing information.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only license and copyright comments with no executable logic, no input handling, no data processing, and no external communications. No suspicious or malicious activity can be inferred from static comments alone. The version number '2025.1' is unusual but not inherently malicious; it likely indicates a future version or placeholder. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior in the comments.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code consists solely of licensing information and metadata comments. It shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks. No further security concerns are identified.",
