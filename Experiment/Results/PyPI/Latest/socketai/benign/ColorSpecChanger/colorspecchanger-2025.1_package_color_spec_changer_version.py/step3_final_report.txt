  "flows": "No data flow; static comments and metadata only",
  "anomalies": "Unusual version number '2025.1' but no malicious implications; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments and metadata related to licensing and attribution. No executable code, input handling, or network activity is present. The version number '2025.1' is unconventional but not suspicious. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, aligning with the benign nature of the content. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the static and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as documentation and licensing information. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
