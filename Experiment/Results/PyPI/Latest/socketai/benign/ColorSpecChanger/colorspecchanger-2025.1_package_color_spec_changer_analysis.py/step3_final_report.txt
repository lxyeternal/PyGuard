  "purpose": "Utility module for interpreting and describing color formats based on input data types, strings, arrays, or numbers.",
  "sources": "String inputs (hex codes, regex matches), numeric types (int, float), tuples/lists, numpy arrays.",
  "sinks": "None; no external system interactions, network calls, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data is checked for type, then processed via regex matching or type-based formatting to produce a format description object.",
  "anomalies": "The function TargetFormatHasOpacity is unimplemented, raising NotImplementedError, indicating incomplete functionality but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard parsing, type checking, and formatting for color representations. No suspicious patterns, code injection, or malicious behaviors are present. Regex matching and data handling are straightforward. The incomplete TargetFormatHasOpacity function does not introduce security issues but suggests incomplete implementation. No external data flows or side effects are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for color format interpretation. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The incomplete function does not pose a security risk but indicates incomplete development. The overall security posture is very safe.",
