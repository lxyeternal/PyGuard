  "purpose": "Defines color format specifications, regex patterns, and format lists for color validation and conversion.",
  "sources": "Static constants, regex pattern definitions, and functions generating format lists.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input or output handling.",
  "flows": "Static data used for validation; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward static configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static constants, regex patterns, and functions for generating supported format lists. No external input, data transmission, or dynamic code execution occurs. Regex patterns are compiled once and used for validation. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code is purely configuration and validation logic for color formats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended for format validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores are justified. The code can be considered safe for use.",
