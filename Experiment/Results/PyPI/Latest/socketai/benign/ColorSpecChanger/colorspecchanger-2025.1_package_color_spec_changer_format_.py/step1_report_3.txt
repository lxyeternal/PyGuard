{
  "purpose": "Defines a color format data structure and related class methods for processing color format names.",
  "sources": "Import statements; class method NewFromTargetName; constant variables used within method",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted input in a harmful way; no network, file, or environment variable operations",
  "flows": "Input string 'name' flows into logic within NewFromTargetName to determine format parameters",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to solely process color format definitions based on naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing and numpy modules, defines a NamedTuple class for color formats, and a class method for creating instances based on format name strings. It performs string checks and assigns types accordingly, with no external system calls or data exfiltration. No obfuscated code, malicious code, or suspicious network activity is present. The license notices are standard and do not affect code safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for color format handling with no malicious intent. It only processes format names to set parameters, and there are no signs of malware or security risks.",
