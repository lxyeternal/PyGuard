{
  "purpose": "Defines a color format data structure and a factory method to create instances based on format name.",
  "sources": "import statements, class method NewFromTargetName, and constants used within the class",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow to untrusted sources or outputs",
  "flows": "The method processes the format name to determine attributes; no external data flow or untrusted inputs detected",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data structures and a class method for constructing format objects based on string identifiers. It imports constants and types, uses conditional logic for setting properties, and adheres to standard Python conventions. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious operations are present. The code includes license and copyright notices but contains no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for handling color format representations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
