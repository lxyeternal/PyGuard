{
  "purpose": "Defines a color format data structure and a factory method to interpret format names into configuration objects.",
  "sources": "String inputs representing format names, imported constants for prefixes and supported formats.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network operations, or data exfiltration points detected.",
  "flows": "Input format name strings processed within NewFromTargetName to set properties of format_t instances.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class for color formats with a class method that interprets format name strings to set internal properties based on string checks and constants. It performs straightforward string comparisons and assignments without external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The license notices are standard legal boilerplate. No malicious or obfuscated code patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation for handling color format configurations. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
