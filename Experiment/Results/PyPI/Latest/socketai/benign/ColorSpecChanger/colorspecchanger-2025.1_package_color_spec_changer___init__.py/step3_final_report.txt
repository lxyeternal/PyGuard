  "purpose": "Conditional import of beartype for optional type checking based on environment; licensing and attribution comments.",
  "sources": "The __file__ path, site.getsitepackages(), site.getusersitepackages() for environment detection; no untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no external communication or data processing.",
  "flows": "Environment detection flow leading to optional invocation of beartype_this_package() if conditions are met.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward environment check and import pattern; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment checks to conditionally activate beartype, a standard pattern for optional type checking. It contains extensive licensing comments but no network activity, file manipulation, or execution of untrusted data. The logic is simple, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The conditional call to beartype_this_package() is benign and based on directory structure, not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard setup code with no malicious or security concerns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the benign environment detection pattern.",
