  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates low-level, stealthy system call invocation techniques associated with malware or rootkits. While not explicitly malicious, its capabilities for evading detection and executing arbitrary syscalls pose significant security risks. The overall malware score is high, and the obfuscation level is substantial, warranting caution."
