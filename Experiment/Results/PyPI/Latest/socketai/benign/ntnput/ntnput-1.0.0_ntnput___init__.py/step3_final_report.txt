{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for low-level input injection (mouse and keyboard) on Windows via undocumented or less common system calls, enabling automation or stealth input manipulation.",
  "sources": "Functions read input parameters for mouse movement, clicks, and keyboard presses; structures for input data are defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Windows native functions (_NtUserInjectMouseInput, _NtUserInjectKeyboardInput) that inject input directly into the system input stream.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (coordinates, button types, key codes) flow into input structures, which are then passed via system calls to simulate user input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of undocumented or internal system calls through a custom 'misc.syscall' wrapper; absence of input validation; low-level direct input injection techniques; no obfuscation or payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code enables low-level input simulation on Windows, capable of automating or hijacking user input. It employs undocumented syscalls, which are suspicious but not inherently malicious. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions can be misused for stealth automation or malicious input hijacking. The use of internal syscalls increases the potential for misuse, but the code itself does not contain malicious activity. The malware score is low (around 0.2), reflecting the absence of malicious payloads but acknowledging the powerful capabilities. The security risk is moderate (~0.4), considering the low-level access and undocumented syscall usage. Proper safeguards and access controls are recommended when deploying this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate low-level input injection library that can be used for automation or testing but also has potential for malicious misuse due to its capabilities and syscall techniques. It does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation. The overall security risk is moderate, and caution should be exercised in untrusted environments.",
