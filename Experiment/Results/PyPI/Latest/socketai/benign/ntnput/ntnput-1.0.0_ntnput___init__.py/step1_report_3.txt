  "purpose": "This code provides functions for simulating mouse and keyboard input on Windows systems via native syscall wrappers, including moving, clicking, and pressing keys.",
  "sources": "Reads include system metrics, process DPI awareness, and input events (mouse and keyboard actions). It uses internal syscall functions to inject input data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially injects input data directly into system input streams using syscall functions, which can be used maliciously for automation or hijacking user input.",
  "flows": "Input data (mouse/keyboard events) are created and passed to syscall functions (_NtUserInjectMouseInput, _NtUserInjectKeyboardInput) for execution; mouse move and click functions flow data to system input injection.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal syscalls for input injection, which are uncommon in typical applications. The code dynamically loads and invokes Windows native functions for input manipulation, which could be used maliciously to automate or hijack input devices. No input validation or user interaction is involved, and functions can simulate complex input sequences.",
  "analysis": "The code defines structures for mouse and keyboard input injection, wraps Windows native syscall functions for input injection, and provides functions to move the mouse, click, and press keys with optional delays. It uses internal Windows APIs (_NtUserInjectMouseInput, _NtUserInjectKeyboardInput) via syscall wrappers obtained from a 'misc' module, which suggests low-level system interaction. The use of raw syscalls and direct injection of input events can be exploited for malicious automation or controlling a system without user consent. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated elements; its behavior is consistent with input simulation tools. While not inherently malicious, the capability for precise and potentially undetectable input injection poses security risks if misused.",
  "conclusion": "This code is primarily designed for simulating input events at a low level on Windows systems, which can be used for legitimate automation or testing. However, due to its direct syscall usage for input injection, it can also be exploited for malicious purposes such as covert input control or automation of unwanted actions. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are explicitly evident, but the capabilities it provides can be misused in a malicious context. It should be reviewed carefully for appropriate use and access control.",
