{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to simulate mouse and keyboard input on Windows systems via low-level system calls, likely intended for automation or control purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system metrics, process DPI awareness, and input parameters (mouse coordinates, button states, delay durations, key codes).",
  "sinks": "Calls to NtUserInjectMouseInput and NtUserInjectKeyboardInput functions, which inject input events into the system.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (mouse coords, button actions, key codes, delays) are used to construct input info structures, which are passed to system call functions to simulate user input.",
  "anomalies": "Uses direct syscall wrappers for injecting input events, which can be exploited for stealthy automation or malicious input simulation. No hardcoded secrets, but reliance on low-level system calls may obscure intent. No evidence of backdoors or suspicious data exfiltration within this code fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines structures for mouse and keyboard input injection, and wraps low-level system calls to perform these actions. It includes functions for moving the mouse, clicking, releasing, and pressing keys with optional delays. The use of direct syscalls (NtUserInjectMouseInput, NtUserInjectKeyboardInput) is unusual for typical automation scripts, possibly indicating an intent to bypass higher-level input restrictions or detection mechanisms. No hardcoded credentials, network communication, or suspicious data leaks are present. The functions are straightforward and do not contain obfuscated or malicious code. The overall purpose appears to be automation of input, with no clear malicious behavior, but the low-level approach could be exploited for stealthy or malicious automation if misused.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for simulating user input via low-level system calls, which can be used legitimately for automation or testing. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware within this fragment. The use of direct syscall wrappers, while unusual, does not in itself indicate malicious intent but warrants caution if used in untrusted environments. Overall security risk is low.",
