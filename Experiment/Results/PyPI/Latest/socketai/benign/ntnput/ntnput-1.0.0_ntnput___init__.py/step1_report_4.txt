{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to simulate mouse and keyboard input on a Windows system by directly invoking system calls for input injection.",
  "sources": "Reads include system metrics (screen resolution) and process DPI awareness status, both via Windows API calls.",
  "sinks": "Uses custom system calls (_NtUserInjectMouseInput, _NtUserInjectKeyboardInput) to inject mouse and keyboard events directly into the system.",
  "flows": "The functions collect input parameters, normalize or prepare input data, and pass them directly to system calls for input simulation.",
  "anomalies": "The code bypasses typical high-level input APIs, directly invoking lower-level system calls (_NtUserInjectMouseInput, _NtUserInjectKeyboardInput), which is unusual and can be used for stealthy automation or malicious purposes. The code has no input validation for parameters other than button type checks. The use of internal system calls with raw pointers and direct memory manipulations raises suspicion of potentially malicious or covert operation capability.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a set of functions to move, click, and press keys, utilizing undocumented or less-documented system calls to inject inputs at a low level. This method can be exploited for covert automation, keylogging, or malicious control of a user's system without user awareness. The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials or secrets. The logic appears focused solely on input simulation. However, the use of internal system calls and direct Windows API manipulation, especially through custom 'syscall' wrappers, suggests potential for malicious or stealthy behavior, particularly if used in an untrusted context or without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for low-level input injection, which can be used for legitimate automation but also for malicious purposes such as stealth automation or input hijacking. The lack of input validation and the direct system call invocations raise concerns about potential misuse, although there is no explicit malicious activity or payload. It is important to consider the context in which this code is deployed.",
