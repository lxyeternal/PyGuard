{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for a messaging/broadcast system including SMS actions, input configurations, and broadcast creation parameters.",
  "sources": "User-provided input via API endpoints, data from external services, environment variables if used elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable fields if used improperly in application logic (e.g., scheduled_at for injection), but none are directly executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from user input to model instances, with no code execution or external command invocation present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed. No obfuscation or hidden code segments. The 'voice_flow' import may contain code, but not visible here.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines Pydantic models with type annotations, optional fields, and constraints. No code execution, network activity, or dynamic evaluation is present. The fields are used for structured data validation and serialization. The naming conventions and structure appear standard and benign. The only potential concern is 'voice_flow' import, but without its implementation, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe data modeling layer for a messaging system. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this module. It functions solely as data validation schemas.",
