{
  "purpose": "Define data models for a messaging/broadcast system, including validation and serialization settings.",
  "sources": "User inputs via API payloads, environment variables (not explicitly used here), and data fed into the data models.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the 'voice_flow' object, and any data passed into 'actions' and 'inputs' which might be used downstream in system operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs into data models, then possibly into external systems via 'voice_flow' or 'actions' handling, though no explicit external calls are shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behavior are present. The models are straightforward and do not execute code or include obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Pydantic models for validating and structuring message broadcast data, including optional fields and default values. No data manipulation, external calls, or code execution occurs within these models. The 'voice_flow' dependency might be external, but without its code, its behavior cannot be assessed. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The structure appears typical for a data validation schema.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data modeling schema for a messaging system, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It lacks external system calls or suspicious patterns. Overall, it appears safe and straightforward.",
