{
  "purpose": "Define data models for a messaging and broadcasting system, including actions, inputs, status, and broadcast creation requests.",
  "sources": "Input data from external sources such as user requests or API calls, especially fields like 'scheduled_at', 'segment_ids', and 'voice_flow'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe usage could occur if untrusted input influences sensitive operations or system behavior, but no explicit sink such as network connections or file writes is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input through model validation into system processes; no external untrusted data is directly used in critical operations within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a typo in 'inclube_unsubscribed' (likely intended to be 'include_unsubscribed'), which suggests a possible mistake but not malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are visible. The import from '.voice_flow' is relative, but this alone is not suspicious. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Pydantic data models for message actions, SMS details, status reports, and broadcast creation requests. Fields are well-structured with validation constraints. The use of optional fields, literals, and nested models aligns with standard data modeling practices. The typo in 'inclube_unsubscribed' indicates a potential typo, but not malicious. There are no signs of code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior. The models do not execute code or perform any dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data model definition for a messaging system with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The only notable issue is a probable typo in a field name, which does not impact security.",
