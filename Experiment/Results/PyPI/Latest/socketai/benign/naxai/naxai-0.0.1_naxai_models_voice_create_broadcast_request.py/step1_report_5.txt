  "purpose": "Define data models for a messaging broadcast system, including inputs, actions, status, and request parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads data from external input sources via API or user-provided JSON payloads; reads environment variables if used elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if input data is used unsafely in other parts of the application, but within this code, no direct sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into model validation; no direct data flow to external systems is visible within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns. Usage of optional fields and union types is standard. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines data models using pydantic with validation rules. There are no functions executing untrusted code, no dynamic code evaluation, and no network operations. Usage of optional fields and annotations appears standard and safe. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The only potential concern could arise if these models are used insecurely downstream, but within this snippet, no malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward set of data models for managing broadcast messaging parameters. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected within this code segment. It is well-structured, with standard validation, and does not include any suspicious or obfuscated elements.",
