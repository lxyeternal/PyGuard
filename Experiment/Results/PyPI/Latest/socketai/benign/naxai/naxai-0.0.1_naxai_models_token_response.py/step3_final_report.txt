{
  "purpose": "Defines a data schema for OAuth2 token responses using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code is declarative and static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely a data model.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code does not process or transfer data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Pydantic model with three fields: access_token, expires_in, and token_type. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no security issues, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with its benign nature. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or anomalies. The code serves solely as a data schema for OAuth2 token responses, with no external interactions or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard data model with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
