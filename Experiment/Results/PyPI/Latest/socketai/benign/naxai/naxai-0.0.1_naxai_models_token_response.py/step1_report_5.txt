  "purpose": "Define a data model for parsing and validating OAuth2 token responses.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data sources explicitly.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform data output or external calls.",
  "flows": "None; there are no source-to-sink data flows in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and uses standard Pydantic features; no suspicious or unusual code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple Pydantic model with three fields to represent OAuth2 token responses. It contains only class documentation and field declarations with types, without any input/output operations, external calls, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be a standard data validation model used in OAuth2 workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data model for handling OAuth2 token responses with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
