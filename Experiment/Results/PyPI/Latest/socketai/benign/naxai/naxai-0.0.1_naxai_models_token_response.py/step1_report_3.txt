  "purpose": "Define a data model for parsing and validating OAuth2 token response data.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; data is expected to come from API responses validated by this model.",
  "sinks": "Potentially used to process OAuth2 token responses; no sinks that lead to malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (token response) flows into the model via attribute assignment during validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the class is a standard Pydantic model with documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward Pydantic BaseModel subclass to model OAuth2 token responses, with clearly defined fields and docstring. No external data input methods, no dangerous code, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscated elements. It is a typical data model class used for API responses, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data validation model for OAuth2 token responses. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
