  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward Pydantic data model defining three fields for OAuth2 token responses. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws. The code simply declares a schema with no runtime logic, external data handling, or side effects.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and free of suspicious behavior. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.  \n   **Conclusion:** The reports are sound and do not contain errors.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n   - obfuscated: 0\n   - malware: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0  \n   These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code. Since no malicious activity or security issues are detected, the scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   The risk scores are all 0, indicating no security risk. This aligns with the code's benign description. No justification is needed for higher scores since there's no evidence of vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \n   All reports assign malware score = 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They base their conclusions on the code's structure, purpose, and behavior, which is purely declarative and standard.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis and the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \n- The code is a standard, well-documented Pydantic model for OAuth2 token responses.  \n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate for the scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no security issues or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.",
