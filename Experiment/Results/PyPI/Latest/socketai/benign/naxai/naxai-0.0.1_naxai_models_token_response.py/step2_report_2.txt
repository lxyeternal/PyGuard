  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward Pydantic model defining three fields: `access_token`, `expires_in`, and `token_type`.\n   - All reports confirm that there are no data processing, external I/O, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as a schema for OAuth2 token responses.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are identified.\n   - The reasoning in each report is consistent and well-founded.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a risk of 0, indicating no security concern, there is no need to justify higher scores.\n   - The code is a simple data schema with no active logic or external interactions.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware`: 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated/malicious code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a benign data model.\n   - No suspicious claims are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My Own Estimation:**\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, benign data schema with no security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Security Risk      | 0      |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is entirely safe and does not pose any security threat. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is necessary.",
