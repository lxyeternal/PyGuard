{
  "purpose": "Defines a data model for parsing and validating OAuth2 token responses using pydantic.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading beyond defining the data model; the class declares data attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; the code does not process or transmit untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only specifies a schema.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pydantic's BaseModel to define a structured model for OAuth2 token responses. It includes descriptive docstrings and three fields: access_token, expires_in, and token_type, with appropriate data types. There is no data input, processing, or external communication; the code solely declares a schema. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward pydantic model for token response validation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
