{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for parsing and validating OAuth2 token responses using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines a class for handling OAuth2 token response data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external output mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the class is a data schema, not active data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Pydantic's BaseModel to create a data validation schema for OAuth2 token responses. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose and attributes, but contains no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation appears standard and intended for typical API response validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign data model definition with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
