  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:\n   - The code defines a simple Pydantic `BaseModel` subclass with three fields: `access_token`, `expires_in`, and `token_type`.\n   - There are no runtime behaviors, external data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as a data schema for OAuth2 token responses.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious patterns.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious code, or security risks are identified.\n   - The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or any suspicious logic.\n\n3. **Error or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is a simple data model.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are present.\n   - The reasoning is sound: the code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n4. **Scores Review**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is justified.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Justification**:\n   - Since the code is purely declarative and contains no malicious logic, the `malware` score remains at 0.\n   - The `securityRisk` score is also correctly set to 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, reflecting no obfuscation or code concealment.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a benign data schema.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on speculation.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n8. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard, safe data model with no malicious or security concerns.\n   - The scores should remain at zero for malware and security risk, with high confidence.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a straightforward, well-documented Pydantic model for OAuth2 token responses. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious behavior, and is free of obfuscation or vulnerabilities. The existing scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
