  "purpose": "Defines a data model for parsing and validating OAuth2 token response data using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flow or output manipulation is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines a model class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Pydantic's BaseModel to define a class representing OAuth2 token responses. It includes descriptive docstrings explaining its purpose and attributes. No external input reading, no data processing, and no side effects are present. The class attributes are standard and appropriate for the context. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious code. The code serves as a straightforward data schema.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple and standard data model definition with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified.",
