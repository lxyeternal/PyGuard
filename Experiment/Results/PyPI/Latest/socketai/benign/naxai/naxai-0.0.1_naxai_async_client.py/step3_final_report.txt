{
  "purpose": "An async Python API client for managing authentication, requests, and error handling with voice, SMS, email, and RCS services.",
  "sources": "HTTP request responses, environment variables for credentials, dynamic resource loading",
  "sinks": "Untrusted response JSON parsing, token storage in memory",
  "flows": "Response JSON data flows from HTTP response to token validation, request headers, and error handling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API client functions: token management, request handling, error mapping. It uses secure practices for token storage, dynamic resource loading, and error processing. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or data exfiltration observed. Response data is parsed directly, which is typical. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscation as 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical risks associated with token handling but no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured async API client with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
