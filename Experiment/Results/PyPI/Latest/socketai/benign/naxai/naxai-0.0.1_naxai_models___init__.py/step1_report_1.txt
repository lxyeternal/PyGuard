  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python script performing some data processing tasks. Without further context, its primary purpose is unclear but does not show overt malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input is read via standard input methods (e.g., input() function, reading files).",
  "sinks": "Outputs are sent to standard output (print statements), or possibly written to files. No direct network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Data is read from sources, processed through functions or variables, then output or stored locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs detected. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious domain or IP addresses.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving reading input, processing data, and outputting results. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No suspicious library usage or obfuscation. The code structure is typical for data processing scripts. No embedded malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears benign with no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided content. It is a standard script performing expected data handling operations.",
