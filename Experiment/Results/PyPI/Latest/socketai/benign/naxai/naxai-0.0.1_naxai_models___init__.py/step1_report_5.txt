  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the lack of comments or documentation, but it appears to be a standard Python script possibly related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, user inputs, and external files. It also imports modules that could potentially load external data or configurations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing data to files, making network requests, executing system commands, or handling sensitive information such as credentials or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, user input, files) through various functions and then potentially to sinks such as network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials or suspicious imports; however, any dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual function calls could be hidden. No such anomalies are apparent from the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and performs typical data handling operations. There are no indications of malicious payloads like system damage, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No obfuscated code, suspicious URL connections, or malicious logic are evident. Without additional context or runtime behavior, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the static review, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It appears to be a normal utility script with no malicious intent.",
