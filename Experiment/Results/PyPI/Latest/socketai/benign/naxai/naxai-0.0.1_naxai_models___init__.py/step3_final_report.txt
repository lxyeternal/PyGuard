  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, user input, network connections, potentially dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, environment variables, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and user input flow into network calls, code execution, or data storage.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, eval/exec with untrusted input, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, complex control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple signs of malicious intent, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network activity suggesting data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The obfuscation score (0.7) and malware score (0.6) are justified by these indicators. The high security risk score (0.75) reflects the potential danger posed by these suspicious behaviors. Benign reports show straightforward code with no anomalies, consistent with low scores. The analysis confirms that the suspicious code's indicators warrant high scores, while benign code remains low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains significant indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network activity, justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. Benign code is free of such indicators. The overall security risk is high for the suspicious code, and low for benign snippets. The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.",
