      "conclusion": "The code contains significant indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network activity, justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. Benign code is free of such indicators. The overall security risk is high for the suspicious code, and low for benign snippets. The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis."
