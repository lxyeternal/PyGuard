{
  "purpose": "Define the package setup configuration for the 'naxai' Python SDK, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Code reads package metadata (name, description, version, URL, author info, keywords) and dependencies from the 'setup()' call.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no execution of untrusted input or network activity within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected. Usage of standard setuptools functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools. It specifies package metadata such as name, description, version, author, and dependencies. All elements are static strings or lists, with no user input or dynamic content. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The dependencies are standard packages ('pydantic' and 'httpx') commonly used in SDKs, not malicious. No network activity or code injection mechanisms are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign setup configuration for a Python SDK package. There are no signs of malware, security risks, or malicious intent in this script.",
