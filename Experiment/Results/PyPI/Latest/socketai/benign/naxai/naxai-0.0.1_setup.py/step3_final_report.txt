{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a setup script for packaging a Python SDK named 'naxai', defining metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package name, description, version, URL, author info, keywords, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not process untrusted input or data, nor does it perform network or system operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script is static and only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' configuration script using 'setuptools'. It contains static metadata and dependencies with no dynamic or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. All dependencies are common Python packages. The structure and content are typical for package distribution scripts, with no code injection, network activity, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
