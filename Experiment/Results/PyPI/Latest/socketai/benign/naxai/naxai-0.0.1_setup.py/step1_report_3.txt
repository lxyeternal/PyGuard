  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'naxai' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string literals for package metadata and dependencies; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or eval statements are present that could process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the script merely passes static data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs detected. The code uses standard setup() procedure.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and project info. All values are hardcoded static strings with no user input, environment variable usage, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
