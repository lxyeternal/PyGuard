  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'naxai', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata, and the list of dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; the code primarily deals with static configuration data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is straightforward package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The email and URL are publicly available info, not secret.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' functions and calls 'setup' with package metadata. It specifies package name, version, description, author info, keywords, and dependencies. All data are static strings or lists; no user input, environment variables, or external data are used. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It solely provides metadata and dependencies for packaging.",
