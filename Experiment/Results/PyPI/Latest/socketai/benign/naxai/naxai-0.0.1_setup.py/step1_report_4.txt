  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for packaging the 'naxai' Python SDK for distribution.",
  "sources": "User input is minimal; data is static (e.g., package name, version, author info). No external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external input. No execution of untrusted code or data flows present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive operations; the code only supplies static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and follows standard setup.py conventions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script defining package metadata. It imports required functions, specifies package details, dependencies, and metadata. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. No external data handling or dynamic code execution occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup configuration file used for packaging a Python SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
