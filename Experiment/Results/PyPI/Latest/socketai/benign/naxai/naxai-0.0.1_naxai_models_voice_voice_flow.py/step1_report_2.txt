{
  "purpose": "Define data models for voice flow configuration, including prompts, choices, and transfer options.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading; these are data model definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; models are used for data validation and serialization.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources; models are static definitions with optional fields.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic. The models include optional URL checks in comments but do not implement URL validation or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple Pydantic data models representing elements of a voice interaction flow, such as choices, menus, and transfer options. Each model defines fields with validation constraints, defaults, and optionality. No user input handling, environment variables, or network operations are present. The comments suggest checking if prompts are URLs, but there is no actual validation or network access implemented. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The models are purely structural and intended for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of data models for voice flow configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any data processing or network communication. The code appears safe, with no indicators of malware or security threats.",
