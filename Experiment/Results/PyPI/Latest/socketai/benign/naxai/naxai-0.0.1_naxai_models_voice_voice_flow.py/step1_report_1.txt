  "purpose": "Define data models for a voice flow configuration, including prompts, choices, and transfer options.",
  "sources": "User input or external configuration files (not explicitly shown), potentially data fed into these models when instantiated.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the models are primarily data schemas. No code writes data to files, networks, or executes commands.",
  "flows": "Data is passed from external inputs into model instances. No source-to-sink flow of untrusted data leading to security issues is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The models include URL-like fields (prompt) but do not validate URLs, which could be exploited if used improperly elsewhere. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Pydantic models for structured data validation related to voice flow configurations. The models specify optional and required fields, some with constraints (like attempts between 1-3, timeout between 5-30). No code execution, network calls, or secret handling is present. No suspicious patterns, hidden behaviors, or malicious intent detected. The use of URL-like fields warrants validation elsewhere but is not inherently malicious. Overall, this is a typical data schema setup without malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of data models for configuring a voice flow system. No malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. It appears to be benign, intended solely for structured data validation.",
