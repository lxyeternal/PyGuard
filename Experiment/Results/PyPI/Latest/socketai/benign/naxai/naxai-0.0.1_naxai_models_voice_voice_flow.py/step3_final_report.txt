  "purpose": "Define data models for voice flow configuration, including prompts, choices, transfers, and voicemail settings.",
  "sources": "Fields such as 'prompt', 'destination', and other user-provided data in the models.",
  "sinks": "Potential downstream usage of 'prompt' URLs or other external data, which could be misused if not validated.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model instantiation to downstream systems that may fetch or execute based on 'prompt' URLs.",
  "anomalies": "No code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; only unvalidated URL-like fields are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward Pydantic models with optional URL-like fields ('prompt') that lack validation. No dynamic behavior, code execution, or network activity is present. The models are purely structural, serving as configuration schemas. The main concern is the potential misuse of 'prompt' fields if external data is maliciously supplied, but this is outside the scope of the code itself. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as no malicious code exists. Obfuscation is absent, with a score of 0. The security risk is minimal, around 0.2, reflecting the unvalidated URL fields that could be exploited downstream, but no active vulnerabilities are present in this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as data schemas for voice flow configurations. No malware or obfuscation detected. The primary security consideration is to validate URL fields externally to prevent misuse. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
