{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for voice flow configuration, including prompts, choices, and transfer options.",
  "sources": "None; code only defines data schemas and default values.",
  "sinks": "None; no processing or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'prompt' fields with comments suggesting URL checks; no actual URL validation implemented. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic. The code relies on user-provided data without validation logic, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Pydantic data models specifying structure and validation for a voice flow configuration. No external data sources or sinks are implemented; the models are purely declarative. Comments hint at potential URL inputs for prompts, but no URL validation or dynamic execution is present. The code does not include any suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors. It appears to be a standard schema definition with proper typing and optional fields. No obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of data models for a voice flow system, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It does not perform any operations beyond defining data structures. Therefore, it is safe based on the provided code.",
