{
  "purpose": "The code exports the NaxaiAsyncClient class for external use, likely as part of a package API.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.async_client' to import NaxaiAsyncClient.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "The code imports a class from a local module and exposes it via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module, which is standard practice in Python packages. It then declares the class in __all__ for export. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or other potentially malicious actions. The simplicity indicates a standard module export statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that exposes a class for external use. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks present.",
