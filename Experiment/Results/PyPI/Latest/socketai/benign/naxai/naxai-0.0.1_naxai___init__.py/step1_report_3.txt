  "purpose": "This code module exports the NaxaiAsyncClient class for external use, indicating its purpose is likely to provide an asynchronous client interface.",
  "sources": "The code imports NaxaiAsyncClient from a local module named async_client.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code imports a class from a local module and then exposes it via __all__, with no data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden behavior, or anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module and defines __all__ to specify public API. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. No potential sinks are identified. The structure is simple and typical for package exports. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module export with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is a simple, non-obfuscated snippet that facilitates exporting a class from a local module.",
