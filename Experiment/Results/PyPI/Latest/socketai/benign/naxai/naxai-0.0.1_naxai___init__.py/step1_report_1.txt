  "purpose": "This code defines an import of a class named NaxaiAsyncClient from a local module async_client and exposes it as part of the module's public API.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module: 'from .async_client import NaxaiAsyncClient'",
  "sinks": "The import statement itself, which loads a class from a local module",
  "flows": "Import flow: module loads NaxaiAsyncClient from async_client; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present; code is straightforward and minimal, only importing and exporting a class",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and sets the __all__ variable to expose that class publicly. There are no user inputs, environment variables, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The structure is minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payload, or unusual behavior. It appears to be standard Python module export code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely exposes a class from a local module.",
