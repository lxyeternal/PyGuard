{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for creating call requests with validation and field mappings.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from API requests or external sources that instantiate the CreateCallRequest model.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous data could be in 'to', 'from_', 'idempotency_key', or UUID fields if used improperly downstream, but the code itself does not process data unsafely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input into the model, with no processing or transformation shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns are present. The code is straightforward data validation with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a Pydantic model for call request parameters, including validation rules and aliases. There is no code execution, network activity, or data handling beyond validation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are observed. The code appears to be a standard, secure data model setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal data validation model for API input with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process or handle data in a malicious manner.",
