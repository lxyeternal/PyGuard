{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be an import and export module, organizing and exposing various classes and constants related to voice calls and broadcasting requests for use in other parts of a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads only from relative module imports (.create_call_request, .voice_flow, .create_broadcast_request). No external input or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output mechanisms are present in this snippet. It merely re-exports classes and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks within this code; it is purely an import/export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains duplicate entries for 'VoiceFlow' in __all__, which is redundant but not malicious. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward import statements and defines an export list (__all__). No logic, data handling, or untrusted data processing occurs. The duplicate 'VoiceFlow' in the __all__ list is unnecessary but benign. No signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module for organizing and exporting components related to voice call and broadcast request handling. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and exhibits no malicious intent.",
