  "purpose": "Organize and export classes and functions related to voice calls and broadcasts for a larger telephony system.",
  "sources": "Local modules: .create_call_request, .voice_flow, .create_broadcast_request",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks",
  "flows": "Import statements to __all__ list for module exports",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate 'VoiceFlow' entry in __all__ list",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes and constants from internal modules and defines an __all__ list for exports. It contains no logic, data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The only minor issue is the redundant inclusion of 'VoiceFlow' in __all__, which is harmless. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The redundancy does not impact security but could be cleaned for clarity. Overall, the code is a standard module setup for organizing exports, posing no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and contains no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate, and the only minor issue is the duplicate 'VoiceFlow' in __all__, which does not affect security. No changes are necessary.",
