{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and functions from local modules related to voice flow and broadcast requests, and defines an __all__ list for module exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads only from local module files (.create_call_request, .voice_flow, .create_broadcast_request). No input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network operations, or data leak points are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code structure appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes and functions from local modules and specifies exports via __all__. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no network or system modifications. The code serves as a module interface definition with standard import/export statements. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization file defining available exports. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
