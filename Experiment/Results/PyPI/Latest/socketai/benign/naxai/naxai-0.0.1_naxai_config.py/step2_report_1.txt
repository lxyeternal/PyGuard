  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirms that the code only assigns empty strings to `API_BASE_URL` and `AUTH_URL`.  \n- No data flows, network activity, or further code are present.  \n- Notes the suspiciousness of placeholders but no direct malicious behavior.  \n- Confidence: 0.4, malware: 0, securityRisk: 0.2.  \n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low confidence reflects uncertainty, and the absence of evidence for malicious intent is consistent. No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that these are placeholder assignments with no further code.  \n- Confident that this is benign configuration code.  \n- Confidence: 1, malware: 0, securityRisk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** The reasoning is clear and justified. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Again, the code only assigns empty strings with no further context.  \n- No malicious activity or obfuscation observed.  \n- Confidence: 0.3, malware: 0, securityRisk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Reasoning aligns with the evidence. No change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Similar analysis: placeholders with no further suspicious activity.  \n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, securityRisk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned; the high confidence is appropriate given the context.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same pattern: variable assignments with no other code or activity.  \n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, securityRisk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Evidence:** All reports confirm that the code only assigns empty strings to configuration variables with no further operations.  \n- **Malware and Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks.  \n- **Risk Scores:** Since the code is just placeholder variable assignments, the security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero.  \n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports appropriately assign low or zero scores for malware and obfuscation. Confidence varies but generally aligns with the limited context.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be 0, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n- **Risk Score:** Should be very low, perhaps 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting that these are placeholders but not inherently dangerous.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since placeholders alone are benign but could be part of incomplete or malicious setup if taken out of context)\n\n**Summary:** The code snippets are benign placeholder assignments with no malicious or obfuscated characteristics. The scores should reflect this minimal risk.",
