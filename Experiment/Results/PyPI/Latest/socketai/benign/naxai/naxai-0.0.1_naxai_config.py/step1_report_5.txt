  "anomalies": "Variables are initialized with empty strings, which could be placeholders but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares two variables and assigns them empty strings. There are no function calls, data inputs, or network interactions. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The variables may be placeholders for configuration values, but as provided, they contain no sensitive or malicious data.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be just placeholder variable declarations for URLs.",
