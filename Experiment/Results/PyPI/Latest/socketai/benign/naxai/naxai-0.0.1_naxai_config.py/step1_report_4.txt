  "purpose": "Define empty configuration strings for API base URL and authentication URL",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments at the beginning of the code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow; variables are assigned but not used",
  "anomalies": "Empty string assignments for URLs may indicate placeholder values or incomplete configuration; no malicious activity evident",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two variables being assigned empty strings. There is no input reading, data processing, network communication, or sensitive data handling. Without further context or additional code, these assignments are benign. The lack of actual URL values suggests placeholders rather than malicious intent. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, containing only placeholder variable assignments with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
