{
  "purpose": "Define empty string variables for API base URL and authentication URL, likely for configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting string variables for URLs",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; variables are initialized with empty strings",
  "anomalies": "Variables are initialized with empty strings; no further code present to evaluate for malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code assigns empty string values to two variables, 'API_BASE_URL' and 'AUTH_URL'. There is no usage of these variables, no input handling, no external data fetching, and no suspicious operations. The absence of further code limits the assessment but suggests a placeholder or configuration setup rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on these variable assignments, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. These appear to be configuration placeholders. However, without additional context, it's not possible to fully assess security implications.",
