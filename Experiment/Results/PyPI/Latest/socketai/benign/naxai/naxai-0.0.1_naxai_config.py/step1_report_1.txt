{
  "purpose": "Initialization of API base URL and authentication URL variables, likely for configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements where the variables API_BASE_URL and AUTH_URL are set.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not involve data flows to sinks, network calls, or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; variables are set to empty strings with no further use shown.",
  "anomalies": "Setting URL variables to empty strings without context or validation is suspicious, potentially indicating incomplete or malicious configuration placeholders.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns empty string values to two variables intended to hold URL endpoints. No further operations, data input, or network activity is present. Empty URL placeholders can be benign if part of a larger configuration system, but they may also indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity or incomplete code. Given only these lines, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. Lack of context prevents definitive conclusions, but the suspiciousness of empty URL assignments warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet by itself does not demonstrate malicious behavior but is suspicious as placeholders for URLs without validation or further context. It may be benign configuration code or part of an obfuscated or incomplete malicious setup.",
