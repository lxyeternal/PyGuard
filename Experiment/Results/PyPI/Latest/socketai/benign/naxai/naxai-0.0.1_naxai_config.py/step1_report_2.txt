{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define two variables intended to hold URL strings, likely for API access and authentication.",
  "sources": "Assignment of empty string literals to variables API_BASE_URL and AUTH_URL.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data propagation observed.",
  "anomalies": "Variables are initialized as empty strings, which could be placeholders, but no further code indicates malicious intent or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains two variable assignments with empty strings, possibly placeholders for configuration. No dynamic input, no network activity, and no security-sensitive operations are present. The lack of actual URLs or code to process data indicates low risk. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is benign, likely serving as configuration placeholders. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
