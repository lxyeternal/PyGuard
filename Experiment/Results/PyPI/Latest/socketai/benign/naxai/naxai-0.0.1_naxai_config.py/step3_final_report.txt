  "purpose": "Assessment of minimal placeholder URL variables in a Python module for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Assignment of empty strings to variables 'API_BASE_URL' and 'AUTH_URL'. No data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows present; no untrusted data processing or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "None; variables are assigned static empty strings with no further code or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and minimal, serving as placeholders.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns empty strings to two variables, with no additional logic, data flows, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are appropriate given the minimal and benign nature of the code. Confidence levels are generally high, reflecting certainty about the benign intent. No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign placeholder configuration variables with no malicious or obfuscated characteristics. The risk is negligible, and the scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score (~0.1) to account for potential misuse in a broader context.",
