{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package by importing specific functions from a local module and exposing them for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports functions from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as no data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions from the 'gemini' module and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py file that imports two functions and defines __all__ for package exports. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No external data handling, dynamic code, or network activity is present. The code's structure and content pose no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package initializer with no malicious or security issues. The scores and analysis are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
