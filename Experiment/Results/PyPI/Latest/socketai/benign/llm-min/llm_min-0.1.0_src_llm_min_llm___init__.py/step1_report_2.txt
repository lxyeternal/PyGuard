  "purpose": "Defines a Python package for the 'llm' directory, importing specific functions from a module named 'gemini'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.gemini' for importing functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports functions 'chunk_content' and 'generate_text_response' from '.gemini' into the package namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a package initializer, setting up imports for other modules to use. It does not contain data processing, user input handling, network operations, or security-sensitive functions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual logic. The imports appear standard and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package __init__.py file, establishing package exports without any malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
