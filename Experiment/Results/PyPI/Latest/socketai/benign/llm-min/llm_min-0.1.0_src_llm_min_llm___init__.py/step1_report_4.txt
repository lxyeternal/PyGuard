{
  "purpose": "To define an API surface for the 'llm' package by exporting specific functions from the 'gemini' module.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from a local module '.gemini'. No external or untrusted data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code only sets module exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard for Python packages, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward package initialization file that imports functions from a local module and declares public API symbols. No external input, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations are present. The structure and syntax are typical for Python packages. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization script that merely exports functions. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
