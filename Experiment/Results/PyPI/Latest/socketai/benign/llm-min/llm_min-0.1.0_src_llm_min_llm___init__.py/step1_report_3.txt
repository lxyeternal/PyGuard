{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package module that imports specific functions from a submodule named 'gemini' and exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.gemini' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external interactions",
  "flows": "Import from '.gemini' to exported functions in __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import/export structure",
  "analysis": "The code simply makes the 'llm' directory a Python package by importing two functions ('chunk_content' and 'generate_text_response') from a sibling module 'gemini' and specifying them in the __all__ list for exports. There are no inputs, no untrusted data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs. It appears to be standard packaging code with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package __init__.py style module that re-exports functions from a submodule. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code.",
