{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate text responses using the Google Gemini API based on input prompts, with functions for content chunking and environment-based API key retrieval.",
  "sources": "Environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY, function parameters (prompt, api_key), imported modules, and response from genai.Client",
  "sinks": "Response text output, logging errors, and warnings",
  "flows": "Input prompt -> generate_text_response -> API key retrieval -> API call via genai.Client -> response handling -> output or error message",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; use of environment variables for API key; proper exception handling; no suspicious code or backdoors; asynchronous function is standard; logging used appropriately; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables, manages API key securely via environment variable or parameter, uses the genai.Client API for content generation, and handles errors gracefully. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert operations. All data flows appear standard for an API client. Logging is used for error reporting, and environment variables are used for sensitive data. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API client wrapper for Google Gemini with content chunking and error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The design and code structure are standard and safe.",
