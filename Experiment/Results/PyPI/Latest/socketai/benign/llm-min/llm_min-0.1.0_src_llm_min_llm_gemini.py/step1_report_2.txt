{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate text responses using the Google Gemini API, with content chunking and environment variable management for API keys.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (GEMINI_API_KEY), function parameters (prompt, api_key), imported modules (os, dotenv, genai)",
  "sinks": "genai.Client constructor, client.models.generate_content method, response.text access",
  "flows": "API key sourced from environment or argument -> client instantiated with API key -> generate_content called with prompt -> response.text accessed and returned",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; response handling includes checks for blocked content; no suspicious or unusual code patterns or backdoors; no obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables securely, uses an async function to interact with the Gemini API, and handles exceptions gracefully. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code employs standard API interaction patterns and logging. No hardcoded secrets are found. Response handling checks for potential blocks, indicating awareness of API response issues. Overall, the code appears clean, straightforward, and aligned with intended API usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate API calls to generate text responses, with appropriate security practices like environment variable use and error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and functional.",
