{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to process large text content by chunking and to generate responses using Google's Gemini API asynchronously, with configuration managed via environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (GEMINI_API_KEY), input prompt parameter, and external modules (dotenv, os, genai).",
  "sinks": "Uses the Gemini API client to send prompts and receive generated content, potentially exposing API keys if improperly handled.",
  "flows": "Environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY flows from os.getenv to generate_text_response; prompt input flows into generate_content API call, and response text flows back as output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; environment variables are used for API keys. No suspicious code constructs or obfuscated code are present. The code uses standard library functions and expected external modules. No suspicious network activity is evident, and no data leakage or backdoors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads environment variables for the API key, avoiding hardcoded secrets. The API key is used only in the client instantiation for external API calls. The response handling includes error and block reason checks, indicating cautious API interaction. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Use of async functions and environment variables aligns with typical secure practices. The code appears clean, standard, and unlikely to contain malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard text processing and external API interaction without any malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It handles sensitive data (API keys) responsibly using environment variables and incorporates appropriate error handling. There are no indications of malware or security risks within this module.",
