{
  "purpose": "Provides an async function to generate text responses using the Google Gemini API, handling API keys via environment variables or parameters, with content chunking and error handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY, prompt input, response object from genai.Client",
  "sinks": "API call to genai.Client.generate_content, response.text output",
  "flows": "API key from environment or parameter to genai.Client, prompt to generate_content, response to response.text",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard API interaction and error handling",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads environment variables, uses a standard API client with proper error handling, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. Response handling includes checks for blocked content and exceptions. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified based on the code's straightforward and secure design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is secure, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects minimal external API reliance and proper environment variable management. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
