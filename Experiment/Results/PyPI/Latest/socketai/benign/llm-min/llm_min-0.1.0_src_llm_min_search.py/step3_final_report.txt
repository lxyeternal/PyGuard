{
  "purpose": "The code searches for documentation URLs related to a Python package using DuckDuckGo, then employs an LLM to select the most relevant URL, and finally cleans the URL for usability.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (package_name, search_results, api_key), and from the DuckDuckGo search results.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the selected URL after validation and cleaning; no direct data leaks or untrusted data effects are present.",
  "flows": "Search results are generated from the search API, passed to the LLM for selection, and the selected URL is validated and cleaned before being returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The regex URL cleaning is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs URL search, LLM-based selection, and URL cleaning with proper error handling and validation. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. External dependencies are standard and do not introduce malicious behavior. The regex cleaning is straightforward, removing common index files and version segments. The URL validation only checks for 'http://' or 'https://', which is minimal but acceptable. The overall logic is sound, and the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs a standard URL discovery and cleaning process. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident. The external dependencies and regex operations are safe, and the scores assigned in the reports are justified.",
