  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure documentation processing utility with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low risk score (around 0.2) is justified by external API reliance, which is typical for such tools. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
