  "purpose": "This file serves as a marker to make Python treat the 'src' directory as a package, likely an '__init__.py' file.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it contains only a comment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist, as the code is purely a comment with no executable statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is a simple comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single comment intended to designate a directory as a Python package. It contains no executable code, data processing, or external interactions. The code's simplicity and standard usage imply no security risks, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package marker with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
