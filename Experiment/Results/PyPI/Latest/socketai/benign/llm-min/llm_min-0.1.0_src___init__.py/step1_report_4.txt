  "purpose": "To make Python treat the `src` directory as a package by including a special `__init__.py` file.",
  "sources": "N/A (no code reading input or data apart from the file itself)",
  "targets": "N/A (no untrusted data handling or external effect)",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for package initialization; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is simply a comment explaining the purpose of the file. There are no executable statements, no data handling, and no external interactions. It is a typical `__init__.py` file used to mark a directory as a package, with no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless and serves a standard purpose in Python package structure. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
