  "purpose": "This file configures Python to recognize the 'src' directory as a package.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external outputs, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways; code is purely configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies or suspicious constructs; standard package initialization comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comment indicating its purpose and a single line that makes Python treat 'src' as a package by including an __init__.py file or similar. There are no data processing, external connections, or security-sensitive operations. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package structure setup.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard package initialization file with no malicious intent or security risks.",
