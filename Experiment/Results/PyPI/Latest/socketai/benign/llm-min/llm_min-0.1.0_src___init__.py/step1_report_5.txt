  "purpose": "To instruct Python to treat the `src` directory as a package by making it recognizable as such during imports.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code is a simple comment explaining the purpose.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or potential vulnerabilities present.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a comment with no executable code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a comment intended to clarify the purpose of a file in a project. It does not perform any operations, read data, or contain any executable code. Since no code execution, data processing, or input/output handling is present, there are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation to evaluate. The comment appears to be a standard practice in Python projects to designate a directory as a package, with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is only a comment explaining the purpose of a directory in a Python project. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscation present. It is a benign and standard practice in Python package structuring.",
