{
  "purpose": "To make Python treat the `src` directory as a package by including a `__init__.py` file.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; the code is a comment and a potential `__init__.py` file for package initialization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution paths; the code simply enables package recognition.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating purpose; no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The file appears to be a simple `__init__.py` with a comment explaining its purpose. No code executing logic, no data reading, no external interactions. The comment is benign and typical for Python package setup. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization file with a descriptive comment. It poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
