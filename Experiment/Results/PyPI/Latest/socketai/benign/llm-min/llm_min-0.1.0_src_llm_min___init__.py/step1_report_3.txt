  "purpose": "To make Python treat the 'llm_min' directory as a package",

  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output actions in this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple comment and a single statement, with no suspicious or unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious commands present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a comment explaining the purpose and a single statement that indicates directory as a package (__init__.py or similar). There are no data inputs, no control flow, and no suspicious behaviors. The code is standard for Python package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to designate a directory as a Python package. There are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain threats, or security risks.",
