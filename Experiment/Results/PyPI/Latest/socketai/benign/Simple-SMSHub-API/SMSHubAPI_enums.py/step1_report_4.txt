  "purpose": "Define enumerations for currencies and statuses, likely used for application logic or state management.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains class definitions with hardcoded values.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no functions or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow exists beyond static enumeration definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the enum definitions appear standard with meaningful constant values.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two Enum classes defining constants for currencies and statuses. The currency values (643 and 840) correspond to known ISO currency codes for the Belarusian Ruble and US Dollar, respectively. The Status enum uses integer codes with descriptive comments. No hardcoded secrets, untrusted input handling, or suspicious code patterns are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward enum definitions serving as constants. There are no indicators of malicious activity or security risks. The code appears benign and intended for application logic purposes.",
