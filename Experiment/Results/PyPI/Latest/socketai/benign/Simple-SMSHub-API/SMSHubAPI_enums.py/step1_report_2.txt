{
  "purpose": "Defines two enumerations for currency codes and status indicators, likely for use in a financial or communication system.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present in this code; all data is hardcoded within enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leaks are present; the code only defines enums with constant values.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observed, as the code only declares enums without any data processing or transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior are detected. Enum values are standard, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Enum classes, Currency and Status, with straightforward constant values. Currency codes are standard numeric identifiers (likely ISO codes). The Status enum uses numeric codes with comments, indicating optional or standard status indicators. There are no signs of malicious intent, no data leaks, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical enum declaration for use in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign enumeration declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a standard system for handling currency and status codes.",
