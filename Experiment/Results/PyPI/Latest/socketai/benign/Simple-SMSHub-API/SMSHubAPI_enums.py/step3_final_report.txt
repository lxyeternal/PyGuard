{
  "purpose": "Defines enumeration constants for currency and status codes used in the application.",
  "sources": "Static enum definitions; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static constants used within application logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and clear.",
  "analysis": "The code declares two Enum classes with fixed integer values representing currencies and statuses. There are no external inputs, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns. The values correspond to standard codes (e.g., ISO currency codes). No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is simple, static, and serves as constants for broader application use. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0, as there are no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward enumeration declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
