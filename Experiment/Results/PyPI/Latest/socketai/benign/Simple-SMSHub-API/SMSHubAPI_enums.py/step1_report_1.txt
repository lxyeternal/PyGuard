{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations for currencies and statuses, likely for use in a larger application",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static enum definitions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs involved in this code segment",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static enumeration definitions only",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Enum values are standard and self-explanatory.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Enum classes, Currency and Status, with integer values assigned to each member. The enums appear to serve as constants for currency codes and status codes, respectively. No external data is read, and there are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscated segments, or malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The values used are standard currency and status identifiers, and there is no indication of any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, safe enumeration definition with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It simply provides named constants for use elsewhere in the application.",
