{
  "purpose": "Defines two enumeration classes, Currency and Status, for representing currency codes and status indicators.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points, no data processing or external communication functions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only declares enums.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The enum values appear to be standard numeric codes for currencies and statuses.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of enum class definitions with fixed integer values. No dynamic execution, input handling, or external dependencies are present. The enum names suggest a typical use case for representing currency and status states. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent are evident. The code structure is straightforward and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard implementation of enumeration classes with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a simple purpose of defining constants.",
