  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the original code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward declaration of two Enum classes, `Currency` and `Status`.\n- The values assigned are standard numeric codes, with `643` and `840` likely corresponding to ISO currency codes (e.g., Belarusian Ruble and US Dollar).\n- There are no external inputs, dynamic code, network calls, or suspicious patterns.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:\n- **Logical or reasoning flaws:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n- **Any overestimations or underestimations?**  \n  The reports assign malware scores of 0 and risk scores mostly at 0 or 0.1, which seems appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Mostly `0`, with one report at `0.1`. Given the code's nature, even `0.1` seems slightly overcautious but acceptable.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- No reason exists to assign a higher malware or security risk score here, as the code is purely declarative with no malicious indicators.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 for extreme caution, but 0 is justified)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard enum declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity are present.\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe code is safe, and the scores reflect that. I would assign **malware: 0**, **obfuscated: 0**, and **risk: 0** as the most appropriate evaluation.",
