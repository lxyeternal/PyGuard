  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The original code is a straightforward enumeration declaration with no dynamic behavior, external input, or data processing. All reports correctly identify that there are no external data sources, sinks, or flows. The enums are simple constants for currency and status codes, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no obfuscation, malware, or security risks. No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, which is reasonable given the lack of any suspicious activity.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports justify a risk score above 0.5. The code is a static enum declaration with no external dependencies or behaviors that could pose a security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   No report makes unwarranted assumptions; they all correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis provided. The overall assessment across reports is that this code is safe, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (or very close to 0, e.g., 0.1 at most, but given the code's simplicity, 0 is appropriate)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a simple, static enumeration declaration serving as constants for currency and status codes. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent in their evaluations.\n\n**Overall Recommendation**:  \nNo security concerns are identified. The code is benign and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
