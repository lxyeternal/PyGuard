  "purpose": "Define enumerations for currency codes and status messages for some application logic.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; only static enumeration definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; purely data definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static enum declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Enums appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code declares two enum classes: 'Currency' with two currency codes (643, 840), and 'Status' with status indicators. All code appears to be standard enum declarations with no external input, no dynamic code execution, and no hidden or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, no external calls, and no unusual code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of enum classes for currency and status codes. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. The code appears benign and serves a typical purpose of defining constants.",
