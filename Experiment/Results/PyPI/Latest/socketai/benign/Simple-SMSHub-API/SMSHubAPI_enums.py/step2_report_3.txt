  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward enum declaration with no external input, no data flow, and no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- The code defines two enums: `Currency` with values 643 and 840, and `Status` with values 1, 3, 6, 8.\n- The currency codes correspond to known ISO currency codes (643 = Belarusian Ruble, 840 = US Dollar).\n- The status codes are standard numeric indicators, with comments indicating optional or standard statuses.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are identified in any report.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments.\n- The enums are static, serve as constants, and are used in application logic.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 or 0.1 (minimal)\n- The `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in report 3 seems slightly higher than others, but still very low, indicating negligible risk.\n- The overall risk scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Justifications:**\n- The code is purely declarative, with no external data handling.\n- No dynamic or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The enum values are standard and meaningful.\n- No indication of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no changes are necessary.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0, given the code's clarity.\n- The security risk could be slightly increased to 0.1 in report 3 due to the mention, but given the evidence, it remains very low.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, standard enumeration declaration with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.",
