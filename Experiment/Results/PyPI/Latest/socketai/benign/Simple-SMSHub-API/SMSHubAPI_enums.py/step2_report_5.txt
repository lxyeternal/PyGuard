  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward declaration of two Enum classes with static values.\n   - All reports agree that there are no external inputs, data flows, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment: the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n   - They correctly identify that the enum values are typical constants, with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - **Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and free of significant errors.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0 or 0.1 (very low)\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n   - These seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** The minor `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in one report is acceptable but could be standardized to 0, considering the absence of any security concern.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5):**\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is static, with no external data handling.\n   - **Conclusion:** Risk scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware = 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they focus on static analysis.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n   - **Conclusion:** Claims are justified and reasonable.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Minor variation in `securityRisk` is acceptable but could be unified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code appears to be a standard, safe enumeration declaration.\n- No changes needed in the scoring.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided assessments.**",
