{
  "purpose": "A Python API client wrapper for SMSHub, facilitating number management, status updates, balance checks, and price retrieval via network requests.",
  "sources": "API responses from network requests, input parameters such as API key, service, country, and status values.",
  "sinks": "Network calls to the SMSHub API, response processing, updating internal state variables like activation ID and phone number.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into network request payloads; responses are processed and may update internal variables or trigger exceptions; response data flows from network to internal state or return values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Response parsing relies on fixed string splits, which is standard for such API wrappers but could be fragile if API response formats change.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured API client for SMSHub, handling network requests, response parsing, and exception mapping appropriately. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Response handling is standard, with proper error management. The internal state management and response parsing are typical for such wrappers. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to handling sensitive data over network with no evident vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score (~0.1) is justified based on the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and well-implemented API client with no malicious intent or security issues. The existing security and malware scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
