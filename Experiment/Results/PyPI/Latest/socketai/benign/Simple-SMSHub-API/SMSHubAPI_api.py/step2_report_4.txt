  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a Python API client for SMSHub, handling phone number retrieval, status updates, balance checks, and prices.\n- It manages internal state (activation ID, phone number).\n- It performs network requests with optional proxy support.\n- Response handling includes error mapping via exception table.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets beyond the API key, no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code appears well-structured, with standard practices.\n- No hardcoded credentials (API key is a parameter).\n- No obfuscated or malicious code.\n- Response handling is straightforward.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- The only potential minor concern is the string splitting on `rsp.text` in `get_number()` and `get_status()`, which assumes a fixed response format, but this is standard for such API wrappers.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate API client with no evident security issues or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of the reports:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confident, low malware, no obfuscation, very low security risk.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard API client behavior, no malicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Also confirms standard behavior, no suspicious activity, no obfuscation.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same conclusion, standard API wrapper, no signs of malware or sabotage.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Consistent with previous, no malicious patterns, responsible handling of sensitive data.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Malware, obfuscation, and risk scores:\n\n- All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and very low security risk (~0.1-0.2).  \n- These are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for scores:\n\n- **Malware score (0):**  \n  No malicious code, no suspicious network activity, no backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated score (0):**  \n  Clear, straightforward code, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score (~0.1-0.2):**  \n  The only minor concern is the reliance on string splitting, which is standard for API wrappers. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard API client, no security issues)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-implemented API wrapper for SMSHub.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks.\n- Scores assigned in reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- Minor potential concern (string parsing) is not malicious, just a typical implementation detail.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and a very low security risk.\n\n---\n\n**System note:**  \nBased on this review, I agree with the scores provided in the reports, and I would assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a risk score of 0.1 to reflect the minimal concern.",
