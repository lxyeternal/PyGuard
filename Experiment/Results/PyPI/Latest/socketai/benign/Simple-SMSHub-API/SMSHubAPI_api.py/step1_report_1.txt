{
  "purpose": "This code provides an API wrapper for interacting with SMSHub, a service for managing phone number verification and status updates.",
  "sources": "User-provided API key, method parameters such as country, operator, service, status, and optional proxy configuration.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to the API URL with sensitive data such as API key, phone numbers, activation IDs, and status codes; response handling that may process sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Input data (API key, parameters) flows into network requests; responses are processed, with some data (like phone numbers, activation IDs) stored internally; responses inform control flow and state changes.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or obfuscated code; no backdoors, no hidden network communications, cryptic functions, or data exfiltration routines; the exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client wrapper with methods for fetching numbers, checking balances, setting statuses, and retrieving prices. It validates inputs, handles responses, and manages internal state variables like activation ID and phone number. The functions utilize network calls securely, with optional proxy support. No suspicious code patterns, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and no obfuscated code. The exception handling is for expected API responses, not malicious control flows. The structure and logic align with typical API client design, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client wrapper for SMSHub with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It responsibly handles network requests, response processing, and internal state management without suspicious or malicious patterns.",
