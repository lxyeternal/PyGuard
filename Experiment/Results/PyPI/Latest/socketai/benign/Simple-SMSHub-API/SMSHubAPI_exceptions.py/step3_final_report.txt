  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for SMSHub API error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and static message strings within exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiation propagates error messages; no external data sources.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes with static messages; no dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception, with static messages. No input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. Exception messages are static and do not contain sensitive data. The structure is standard for error handling modules. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are justified based on the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of custom exception classes for API error handling with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
