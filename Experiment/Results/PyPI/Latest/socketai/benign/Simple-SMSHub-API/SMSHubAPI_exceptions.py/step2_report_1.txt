  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions.\n- No input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- Exception messages are static, straightforward, and do not contain sensitive or dynamic data.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n**Report 1-5 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Define custom exceptions for SMSHub API error handling.\n- Sources & sinks: Class definitions and message passing.\n- Flows: Exception instantiation propagates error messages.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: All reports correctly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Score justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** Zero is appropriate; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Zero is appropriate; these are purely error-handling classes with no security implications.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports assume no hidden malicious intent, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n- No evidence suggests that the exception classes could be exploited or used maliciously.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and reasonable.\n- No changes needed based on the provided information.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n**Final note:** Always consider that in real-world scenarios, the context of how these exceptions are used might influence security assessments. However, based solely on this code snippet, there are no concerns.",
