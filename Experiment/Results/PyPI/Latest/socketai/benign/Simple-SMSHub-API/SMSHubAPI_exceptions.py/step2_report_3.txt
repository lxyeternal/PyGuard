  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions.\n- No input reading, network operations, data handling, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- Exception messages are static strings, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or secret data.\n- The code structure is straightforward and typical for error handling modules.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Code presence and malicious behavior:**\n   - The code does *not* contain any executable logic beyond class definitions.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are present.\n   - Exception classes are standard practice, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Error in reasoning or logic:**\n   - The reports correctly interpret the code as purely defining exception classes.\n   - No logical flaws or security issues are identified or implied.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n   - This aligns with the analysis; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly dismiss any concerns about vulnerabilities, as the code is purely structural.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made; the analysis is conservative and justified.\n\n5. **Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the content.\n   - No anomalies or inconsistencies are evident.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code, no indicators of malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk, as the code is purely for error handling.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code snippet is a benign, standard set of custom exception classes for an API client or server. It does not pose any security threat, does not contain malicious behavior, and is safe for use.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Maintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Score | Justification                                                  |\n|----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0            | No malicious code or indicators present.                       |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            | Code is clear, straightforward class definitions.             |\n| Security Risk  | 0            | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious behavior.       |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, standard, and free of security issues.**",
