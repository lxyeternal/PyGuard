  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions related to SMSHub API interactions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their __init__ methods that set exception messages",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiation, message passing to superclass",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects -> message propagation to base Exception class",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Exception classes are standard for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception. Each class initializes with a specific message, passing it to the base Exception class. No input reading, network operations, or data handling present. No code injection, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors detected. The structure and content are typical for structured error handling. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or malware indicators found.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard custom exception classes for API error handling without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for error management.",
