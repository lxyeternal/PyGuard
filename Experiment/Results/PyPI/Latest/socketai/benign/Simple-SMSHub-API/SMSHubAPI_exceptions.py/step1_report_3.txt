  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions in an SMS hub API",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance hierarchy, no external data sources",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or processing based on external or untrusted input",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes from various parts of an application, propagating error messages",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard Python exception class definitions with default messages",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception, with no dynamic code execution, data processing, or external data input. All classes have straightforward constructors that set error messages, which are standard practice. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs. No obfuscated code, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes for an API, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
