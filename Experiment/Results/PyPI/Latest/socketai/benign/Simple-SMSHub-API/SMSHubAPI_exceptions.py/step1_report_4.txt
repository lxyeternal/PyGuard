  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SMSHub API error handling",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their initializers",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as these are purely exception classes",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception, used for specific error signaling. No input handling, data processing, or external communication occurs. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks. The exception messages are static strings with no dynamic or sensitive data involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for error handling in an API context. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
