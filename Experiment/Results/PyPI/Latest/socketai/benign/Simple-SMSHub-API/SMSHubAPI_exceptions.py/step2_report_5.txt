  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception.\n- No input reading, network operations, data handling, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, with static default messages.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are detected.\n- The code appears to serve solely for structured error handling.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports consistently assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n- The reasoning is sound; no suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The exception messages are static and do not involve any dynamic or sensitive data.\n- No anomalies, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n**Scores and conclusions:**\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the content.\n- The confidence level of 1 across all reports is justified due to the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports' conclusions are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- I agree with the current scores and conclusions.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, benign, and serves a typical purpose in error management.",
