  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions in an SMSHub API client",
  "sources": "None; no input data reading or external data sources",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks, outputs, or external interactions present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code only defines exception classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of standard exception class definitions with default messages",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. Each class has an __init__ method that sets a default error message. There are no data inputs, network interactions, or security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code are present. The structure appears straightforward and typical for error handling in Python projects. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception definitions for an SMS API client, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions solely to provide meaningful error messages for different failure scenarios.",
