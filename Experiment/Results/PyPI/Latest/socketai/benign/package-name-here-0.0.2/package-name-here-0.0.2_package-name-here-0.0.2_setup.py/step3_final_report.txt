  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during package setup, executes a shell command to write a static message to a file in /tmp, serving as a demonstration or proof-of-concept.",
  "sources": "The execution of os.system in the run() method during setup, which reads no external input but executes a static shell command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call that runs a shell command to write to /tmp/seasides2025_pypi_poc.txt.",
  "flows": "From the run() method in the custom install class, through os.system, executing the echo command that writes to a file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system during setup.py execution; static command with no input or dynamic data; no obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code executes a benign static echo command during package installation, writing a message to a temporary file. No external input, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The use of os.system is unconventional and discouraged but not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.3) are appropriate given the context. The main concern is the pattern of executing shell commands in setup scripts, which could be exploited if modified, but in this case, it remains harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration with no malicious intent. The use of os.system during setup is unconventional but not malicious. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the overall security risk is minimal. No further action is necessary beyond noting best practices.",
