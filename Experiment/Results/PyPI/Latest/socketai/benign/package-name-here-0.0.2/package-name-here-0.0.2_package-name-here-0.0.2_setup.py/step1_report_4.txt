{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration that includes a custom installation command.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external untrusted input; it only uses internal modules and fixed strings.",
  "sinks": "The code executes a system command via os.system to write a string into a temporary file.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run() method executes, calling os.system to write to /tmp/seasides2025_pypi_poc.txt.",
  "anomalies": "The use of os.system to run a echo command during installation is unusual for typical setup scripts; it appears to be a demonstration or proof of concept rather than a standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The setup script extends the default install command to include a system call that writes a fixed string into a temporary file. No external inputs, environment variables, or network communications are involved. The command executed is benign in intent but may be considered suspicious due to its side effect during package installation, which is atypical. The script does not contain hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code. The purpose seems to be demonstrative, likely for a proof of concept (POC).",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign, intentionally crafted side effect during package installation, likely for demonstration purposes. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or pose security risks beyond unusual side effects during setup.",
