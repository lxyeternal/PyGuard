  "purpose": "CLI wrapper that accepts a configuration file path, verifies its existence, and invokes an external processing function.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line argument for 'config_path'; file existence check with os.path.exists.",
  "sinks": "Call to 'popgen_run' with the configuration path; no direct sinks for untrusted data within this code.",
  "flows": "Input 'config_path' -> os.path.exists check -> 'popgen_run' invocation with 'config_path'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI interface that validates the existence of a provided configuration file and then delegates processing to 'popgen_run'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The external function 'popgen_run' is a potential point of concern if it executes untrusted code, but this cannot be assessed from the snippet. The code's simplicity and standard validation suggest a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI wrapper with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, and no modifications are necessary.",
