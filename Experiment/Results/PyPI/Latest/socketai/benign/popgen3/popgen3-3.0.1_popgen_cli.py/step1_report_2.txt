  "purpose": "A command-line interface to run the PopGen tool using a specified configuration file.",
  "sources": "Reading the configuration file path from command-line arguments; checking existence of the file.",
  "sinks": "Calling popgen_run with the configuration path; potential for execution based on user input.",
  "flows": "User provides config_path -> code checks file existence -> passes path to popgen_run.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the reliance on external popgen_run function.",
  "analysis": "The script parses a command-line argument for a configuration file path, verifies its existence, logs an error if not found, and then calls an external function 'popgen_run' with the path. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling observed. The script acts solely as a wrapper around 'popgen_run'. The behavior appears standard for a CLI utility. No signs of malware or security risks within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface for running a tool with a configuration file. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious data flow, or security risks in this code segment.",
