  "purpose": "Command-line interface to run PopGen with a specified configuration file.",
  "sources": "Reads the configuration file path from command line argument and checks its existence.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'popgen_run' function with the config path; no direct sink of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "User provides 'config_path' -> 'os.path.exists' check -> 'popgen_run' is invoked with this path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code parses a command-line argument for a config file path, verifies its existence, and then calls a function to run a population genetics process. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, malicious code execution, or suspicious network activity. The code appears to be a straightforward CLI wrapper around an imported function, with standard error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple CLI wrapper for 'popgen_run' with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It performs basic validation and calls a function with a provided file path.",
