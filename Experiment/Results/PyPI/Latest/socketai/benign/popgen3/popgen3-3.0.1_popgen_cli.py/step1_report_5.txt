  "purpose": "Command-line utility to run PopGen analysis using a specified configuration file.",
  "sources": "Reads the configuration file path from command-line arguments; checks for file existence.",
  "sinks": "Calls the 'popgen_run' function with the config path; no direct sinks of untrusted data beyond this call.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument -> File existence check -> 'popgen_run' function with config path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code. No network activity or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script parses a single argument for a configuration file path, verifies its existence, and then invokes a function with this path. The code structure is straightforward, primarily handling input validation before delegating to an external module. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious logic is present. The reliance on an external 'popgen_run' function does not inherently imply malicious behavior, as its implementation is not provided. The code does not contain any obfuscated parts, hardcoded secrets, or external network calls.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard command-line interface script that performs input validation and delegates to an external function. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within the provided code snippet.",
