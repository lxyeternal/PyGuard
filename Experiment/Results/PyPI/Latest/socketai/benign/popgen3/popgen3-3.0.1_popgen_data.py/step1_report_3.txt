  "purpose": "Manage and load input data files for population genetics analysis, including geographic and sample data.",
  "sources": "File system reads for CSV files via pd.read_csv in get_data(). Configuration object attributes providing filenames and paths.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data in a harmful way; data is loaded into pandas DataFrames without insecure execution or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Configuration attributes → get_data() method reads files → DataFrames stored in class attributes; no untrusted data flows to external commands or sensitive outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code appears standard for data loading and processing with proper exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code loads data files based on provided configurations, with checks for file existence and error handling. No dynamic execution, no network operations, no hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The functions handle data safely, and there are no indications of malicious logic or backdoors. The use of pandas for CSV reading is typical and secure when used correctly. Exception handling is in place to prevent crashes, and logging warns of missing or failed loads. Overall, the code is a typical data management module without signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard data handling module for input files, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs data loading and management tasks securely, with proper error handling. The code appears safe for inclusion in larger projects.",
