{
  "purpose": "Handles data loading and management for geographic and regional datasets, including reading CSV files based on configuration objects.",
  "sources": "File system reads via pandas.read_csv from configured filenames, data retrieved from configuration return_dict() methods.",
  "sinks": "Data stored in pandas DataFrames; no untrusted data flows or external network activity.",
  "flows": "Configuration objects -> get_data() -> pandas.read_csv() -> DataFrames stored in class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data loading with error handling, logging, and configuration-driven file access. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or network activity. Exception handling and logging are appropriate, and the code is straightforward and readable. No obfuscation or secret handling observed. The data processing is typical for data management modules, with no suspicious flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data management module with no malicious or suspicious activity. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal filesystem interaction without vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
