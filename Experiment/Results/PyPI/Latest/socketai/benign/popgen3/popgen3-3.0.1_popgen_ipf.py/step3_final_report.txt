{
  "purpose": "Implements demographic and spatial data calibration using Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), reading from pandas DataFrames and configuration objects to adjust frequencies and constraints.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from pandas DataFrames (sample, marginals, constraints), configuration objects, and sample geo data; no external data sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "Data remains within pandas DataFrames; no external communication, file writing, or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrames through processing functions, constraints application, and frequency adjustments within pandas structures; no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Uses standard logging and exception handling. No dynamic code execution or external system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code performs demographic and spatial data calibration via IPF, involving seed generation, zero-cell correction, frequency adjustment, and constraint stacking. It employs standard pandas and numpy routines, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The logic is transparent, with proper handling of potential issues like zero frequencies and convergence checks. No external data transmission or suspicious patterns are present, and the code appears to be a typical demographic modeling implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of demographic and spatial IPF calibration routines. There are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent with the code's functionality.",
