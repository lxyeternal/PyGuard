  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a library, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, static package metadata, dependency declarations, and console script entry point.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or runtime data processing.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward setup code with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script utilizing setuptools for package configuration. It reads static files, declares dependencies with version constraints, and defines entry points. No runtime code, user input, network activity, or obfuscated elements are present. All signals indicate a benign, standard package setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the static and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk are justified and should be maintained.",
