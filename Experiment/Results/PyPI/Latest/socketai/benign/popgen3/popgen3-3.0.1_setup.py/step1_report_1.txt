  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'popgen3' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads package dependencies, package data, and the README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows into untrusted sinks, nor does it process untrusted input at runtime.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows from source inputs to sinks; this is static setup code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious commands or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to define package setup parameters. It specifies package metadata such as name, version, author, and description. It reads the long description from a local README.md file, which is standard practice. Dependencies are listed explicitly with version constraints, reducing risk of malicious dependency tampering. The 'find_packages()' function is used to automatically discover packages. Entry points define console scripts for command-line use. No user input processing, network connections, or system modifications are present. Overall, the code follows typical setup conventions without any suspicious or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs expected package configuration tasks securely.",
