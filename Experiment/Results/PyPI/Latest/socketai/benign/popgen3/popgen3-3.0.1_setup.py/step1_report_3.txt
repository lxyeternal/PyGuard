  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'popgen3' Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from hardcoded strings, reads the README.md file for long description, and specifies dependencies via install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no code execution or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from sources to sinks; dependencies are specified explicitly, and file reading is controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies project metadata, dependencies, package discovery, and entry points. The only file operation is reading a README.md file for documentation. All data appears static and controlled. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
