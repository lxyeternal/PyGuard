{
  "purpose": "The code manages configuration loading, data processing, scenario execution, and output generation for population simulation, with no external untrusted input sources or network activity.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration YAML files, loads data from the database, and accesses class attributes for scenario parameters.",
  "sinks": "Writes CSV output files, logs information and errors; no network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Configuration files → Data load → Scenario setup → Scenario execution → Output files and logs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected. Uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, transparent data processing pipeline. It performs configuration parsing, data loading, scenario management, and output writing without network activity or code injection. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the nature of file I/O and configuration handling. The malware score is zero, and obfuscation is absent. Slightly elevated risk scores in some reports are conservative; based on the code, these should be set to zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured population simulation tool with no malicious or security concerns. All indicators point to safe, transparent operation.",
