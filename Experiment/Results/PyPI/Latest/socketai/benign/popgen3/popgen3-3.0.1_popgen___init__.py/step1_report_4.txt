{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple interface to run a function 'popgen_run' from a local module 'project' using a configuration file path.",
  "sources": "The 'config_path' parameter passed into the 'run' function; the import statement 'from .project import popgen_run'.",
  "sinks": "The 'popgen_run' function invocation, which may process the configuration; potential data flow depends on 'popgen_run' implementation.",
  "flows": "Input 'config_path' flows into 'popgen_run', which is called with this parameter; any processing within 'popgen_run' depends on its implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious constructs present; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module and defines a wrapper function that simply calls 'popgen_run' with the provided configuration path. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to serve as an interface to another module. The security or malicious potential depends entirely on the implementation of 'popgen_run', which is not shown. The code itself contains no suspicious or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal wrapper that calls an external function; it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks on its own. Its security impact relies on the implementation of 'popgen_run'.",
