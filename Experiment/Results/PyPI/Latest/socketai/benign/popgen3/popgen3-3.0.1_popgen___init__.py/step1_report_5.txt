{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a simple wrapper function to call the 'popgen_run' function from the 'project' module, facilitating the execution of a population genetics analysis script from Python.",
  "sources": "The 'config_path' parameter which is used as an input to 'popgen_run'.",
  "sinks": "The 'popgen_run' function call, which may process the 'config_path' input and potentially execute actions based on it.",
  "flows": "The 'config_path' flows from the function argument into 'popgen_run', which is invoked without modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module and defines a wrapper function that passes its parameter directly to this imported function. There are no loops, conditionals, or data manipulations. The simplicity suggests it's a utility or API interface. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign wrapper facilitating the invocation of an existing function. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
