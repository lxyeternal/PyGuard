{
  "purpose": "A wrapper function to call 'popgen_run' with a configuration path.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'config_path' in the 'run' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'popgen_run' function call, which may process the 'config_path'.",
  "flows": "Input 'config_path' flows into 'popgen_run'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs; no suspicious code appears.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that calls 'popgen_run' from a local module with a provided configuration path. There are no apparent malicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows. The code does not process or handle data directly beyond passing the input to another function. Without details of 'popgen_run', no malicious activity can be inferred, but based solely on this snippet, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It depends on the behavior of 'popgen_run', but nothing suspicious is evident here.",
