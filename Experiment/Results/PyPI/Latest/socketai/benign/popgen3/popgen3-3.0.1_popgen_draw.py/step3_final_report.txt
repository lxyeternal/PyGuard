  "purpose": "Generate synthetic populations via weighted sampling, evaluate match quality with constraints using chi-square tests.",
  "sources": "Dataframes for geo frequencies, constraints, region sample weights, and parameters from scenario_config; random seed for reproducibility.",
  "sinks": "None; data is processed internally without external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Weighted sampling from geo frequencies using cumulative probabilities; statistical comparison of synthetic and constraint data via chi-square test.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical sampling and validation procedures with clear, well-structured logic. It uses common libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy) appropriately, sets a seed for reproducibility, and does not include obfuscated or malicious code. The process involves calculating cumulative probabilities, sampling households based on weights, and evaluating the match with constraints via chi-square tests. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign and standard nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation for synthetic population generation and validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
