  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate synthetic population data based on weighted sampling, with a focus on matching constraints using statistical tests.",
  "sources": "Reads data from parameters, dataframes (geo_frequencies, region_sample_weights, geo_constraints, geo_stacked), and random number generation.",
  "sinks": "Uses random numbers for sampling; performs statistical tests. No evident data leaks or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Random number generation influences household selection; data from dataframes is used for sampling and constraints; statistical measures evaluate match quality.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard libraries without obfuscation. No unusual data leaks or hidden network activity. Random seed is set from input parameters, which is normal. No suspicious code constructs or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes with parameter data, setting seeds for reproducibility. It performs weighted sampling of households, computes cumulative probabilities, and measures how well the synthetic data matches constraints via chi-square testing. All operations involve standard statistical and data handling procedures. No malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is evident. Use of numpy, pandas, scipy, and logging is appropriate and standard. The code focuses solely on statistical sampling and testing, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of a synthetic population generator with constraint matching. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
