{
  "purpose": "The code generates synthetic populations by weighted sampling and evaluates their match to constraints using chi-square tests.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters, input dataframes (region_sample_weights, geo_frequencies, geo_constraints, geo_stacked), and random number generation for sampling.",
  "sinks": "Uses np.random for sampling households; statistical test outputs are used internally, no external data transmission or system modification detected.",
  "flows": "Source data (config, weights, constraints) -> sampling functions -> synthetic data generation -> match evaluation (chi-square) -> logging and internal storage.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; standard library functions used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform standard statistical sampling and matching procedures for synthetic population generation. No indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Random seed is set for reproducibility; sampling relies on numpy's pseudorandom generator. The code uses logging for process tracking. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a population synthesis and validation process without malicious intent. It utilizes common statistical and sampling techniques. No signs of malware, data leaks, or security threats are observed.",
