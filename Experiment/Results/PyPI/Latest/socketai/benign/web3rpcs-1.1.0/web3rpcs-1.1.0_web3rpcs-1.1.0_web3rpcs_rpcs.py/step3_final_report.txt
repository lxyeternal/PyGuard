{
  "purpose": "The function performs an HTTP GET request to a fixed URL, appending untrusted 'data' without validation or sanitization.",
  "sources": "The 'data' parameter passed into the 'rpcs' function, directly inserted into the URL.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call which sends an HTTP request to an external server with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input 'data' flows from the function parameter directly into the URL used in requests.get, leading to an external request.",
  "anomalies": "No input validation, sanitization, or response processing; all exceptions are suppressed silently.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, making an external GET request with untrusted input. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The main concern is potential misuse of unvalidated 'data' leading to server-side issues or data leakage. The exception suppression hides errors, which could mask malicious activity or misconfigurations. Scores for malware and obfuscation are appropriately zero; security risk is moderate due to unvalidated input and external request, estimated around 0.3.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign but has a moderate security concern stemming from lack of input validation and exception handling. No malware or obfuscation detected. The primary risk is potential misuse if 'data' is maliciously crafted, but no active malicious activity is present.",
