  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file if it exists to assign to 'long_description'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external commands or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> passes metadata to setup() -> completes without external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard setup code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script that reads a local README file and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. It does not execute external commands, handle untrusted input, or perform any network operations. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or security-risk elements. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified.",
