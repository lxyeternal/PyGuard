  "purpose": "This script is used for packaging a Python project named 'web3rpcs' for distribution via PyPI or other package managers.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file from the filesystem to get the long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The source flows from reading the 'README.md' file into the 'long_description' variable, which is then used in the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are observed. The code uses standard setup procedures. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities from setuptools and reads a local README.md file if it exists to include as long description. It defines package metadata and configuration for distribution. The code is straightforward, uses common practices, and contains no malicious behavior. It does not execute external commands, handle user input, or connect to networks. There are no signs of code injection, data leaks, or hidden malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It poses no security threats, malicious intent, or suspicious behaviors. It is a safe and typical component of a Python project's distribution process.",
