{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up a Python package named 'web3rpcs' with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for the long description and uses 'find_packages()' to locate package modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit untrusted data sinks; the code does not execute or write untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content during setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads the README file if present, defines package metadata, and specifies package requirements and classifiers. The code does not execute external commands, perform network operations, or handle untrusted data in a way that suggests malicious intent. The code structure and functions used are typical for package setup files. No anomalies or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
