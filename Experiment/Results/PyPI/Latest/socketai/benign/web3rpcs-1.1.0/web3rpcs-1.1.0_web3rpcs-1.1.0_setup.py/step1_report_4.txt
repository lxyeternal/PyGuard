{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'web3rpcs', used for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file to obtain the long description.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks data.",
  "flows": "The source (reading README.md) flows into the setup configuration for description purposes; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The script performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python packaging libraries ('setuptools') to define package metadata, dependencies, and description. It reads a README file if available and passes it to the setup() function. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data manipulations involving untrusted input. The code adheres to typical package setup conventions without any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
