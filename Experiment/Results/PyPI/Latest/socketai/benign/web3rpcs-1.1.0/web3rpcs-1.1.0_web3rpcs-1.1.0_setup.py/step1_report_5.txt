  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'web3rpcs' with its metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports from setuptools and os modules; uses find_packages() to locate package modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows into external systems, databases, or network connections.",
  "flows": "N/A, no untrusted data flows to any sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It imports common modules, reads a README file if it exists, and calls setup() with package metadata. No user input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no suspicious logic are present. All elements are typical for Python package configuration. There are no anomalies or signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward and typical setup script for packaging a Python library. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. No malware or obfuscation detected. Overall, the code appears safe.",
