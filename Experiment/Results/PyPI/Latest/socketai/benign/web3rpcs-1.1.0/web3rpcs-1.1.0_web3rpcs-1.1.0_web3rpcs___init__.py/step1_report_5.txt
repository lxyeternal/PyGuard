  "purpose": "Import the 'rpcs' object or module from a relative package within the same project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'rpcs' object/module from a relative import within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication present in this line.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; this line only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for Python modules; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a straightforward relative import of 'rpcs' from a sibling module or package. It does not execute any logic, handle external data, or perform any actions that could be malicious. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks in this single line. Given its simplicity, no suspicious activity or backdoors are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be part of a larger codebase, and on its own, it does not pose any security threat.",
