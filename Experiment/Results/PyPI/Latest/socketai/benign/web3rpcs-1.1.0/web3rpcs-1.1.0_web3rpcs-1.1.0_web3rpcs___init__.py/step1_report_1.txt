  "purpose": "Import the 'rpcs' object or module from a local package or module named 'rpcs'.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .rpcs import rpcs' — this reads the 'rpcs' symbol from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "None; this line only imports code, does not process untrusted data or execute code directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible from a single import statement; it simply includes code or data from another module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; there are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a straightforward import of 'rpcs' from a relative module. It does not contain executable logic, network calls, or data processing. The minimal nature limits the potential for malicious behavior within this snippet. Without additional context or content of 'rpcs', no suspicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement with no indication of malicious intent or security risk. It is a standard Python import, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident.",
