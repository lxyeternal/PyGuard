  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the validity of their findings, scores, and any potential security implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .rpcs import rpcs`.\n- The code is minimal, standard Python import syntax, with no apparent anomalies.\n- No data processing, network activity, or execution of untrusted code is present.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippet **does** contain the import statement as described.\n- There are **no errors, flaws, or suspicious patterns** in the import statement itself.\n- **No malware or malicious activity** can be inferred solely from this import line.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the context.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment, no changes to the scores are necessary.\n- The **risk score of 0** is justified, as this is a benign import statement.\n- The **malware score of 0** is correct; nothing in the code suggests malicious intent.\n- The **obfuscated score of 0** is correct; the code is clear and standard.\n- The **confidence scores** are appropriate, reflecting the minimal and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- If there were additional context, such as the contents of the `rpcs` module, or how this import is used, further analysis could be warranted.\n- But based solely on this snippet, **no security concerns are evident**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe import statement is standard, safe, and presents no security risks. The reports are consistent and correct in their evaluations. No adjustments are necessary.\n\nPlease let me know if additional context or code snippets are available for further review.",
