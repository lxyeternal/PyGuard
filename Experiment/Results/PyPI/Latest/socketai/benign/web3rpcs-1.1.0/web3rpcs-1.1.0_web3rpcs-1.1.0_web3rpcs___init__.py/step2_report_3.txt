  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code is a straightforward import with no anomalies.\n- The confidence is high (0.9), and all scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are zero.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code snippet. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms a simple import with no suspicious activity.\n- Slightly higher confidence (1.0), scores all zeros.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies or risks. The conclusion is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also describes a standard relative import, with no suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence is high (1.0), all scores zero.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above; standard import, no anomalies.\n- Confidence slightly lower (0.9), but still no issues.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern; minimal, standard import, no anomalies.\n- Confidence 0.9, all scores zero.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a simple import statement.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are appropriate and consistent across reports.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- The code snippet is purely an import statement with no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and risk at 0.\n- The confidence levels are justified given the minimal and standard nature of the code.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code snippet is benign, and no further action or concern is necessary.",
