  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Issue presence**: The code is a simple import statement; no malicious activity or anomalies are present.\n   - **Errors or flaws**: None identified.\n   - **Scores**: malware and securityRisk are 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Justification**: The minimal code cannot pose a risk; scores are reasonable.\n   \n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same as above; a straightforward import.\n   - **Errors or flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: All zeroes for malware and risk are justified.\n   - **Justification**: No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities detected.\n   \n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Again, just an import statement; no issues.\n   - **Errors or flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: Consistent with the code.\n   - **Justification**: No evidence of malicious behavior.\n   \n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Standard relative import; no suspicious behavior.\n   - **Errors or flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: Appropriate.\n   - **Justification**: No malicious activity detected.\n   \n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same as above; a normal import.\n   - **Errors or flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: Correct.\n   - **Justification**: No malicious intent or security risk apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports describe the same minimal import statement with no suspicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0 across all reports.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk in the provided snippet)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis: a standard, harmless import statement with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Conclusion**: The scores and analysis are consistent and appropriate given the code snippet. No adjustments are necessary.",
