  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided, but it appears to be a standard Python script or package module.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, function inputs, or external modules. No explicit data input points are shown in the fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or subprocess executions, but none are explicitly identified in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flow identified due to lack of concrete data handling in the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obvious anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual language features. No suspicious imports or code patterns are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward Python module or script without signs of malicious intent. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is standard and does not suggest malicious behavior. The structure and formatting are consistent with normal Python code. Without additional context or complex logic, no malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears to be a benign Python script or package component. Confidence in this assessment is high given the limited scope.",
