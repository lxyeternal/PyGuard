  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports and variable definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import and variable assignments, no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import from a relative module, sets version and export variables. It does not perform any network operations, file access, or execute untrusted data. No hardcoded credentials, malicious behavior, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module initializer with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a typical package setup with no suspicious activity.",
