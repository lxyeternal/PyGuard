  "purpose": "This code exports specific functions and version information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.core) that provides functions qvalue and pi0est.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only performs static imports and defines metadata; no data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual constructs, or suspicious behaviors observed. The import is from a relative module, typical in package code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a package version, explicitly exports two functions and the version string. It uses a relative import from .core, which is standard for internal package modules. No external network calls, data handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be straightforward and conventional for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple package metadata and import setup with no malicious behavior detected. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain anomalies. Overall, it is safe and typical for a Python module.",
