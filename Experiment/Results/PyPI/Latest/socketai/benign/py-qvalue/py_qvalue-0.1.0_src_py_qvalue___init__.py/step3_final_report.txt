  "purpose": "Module initialization and API setup for a Python package, importing functions from a local core module and defining version info.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core module, static variable definitions (__version__, __all__)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or outputs present",
  "flows": "Import from .core -> usage of imported functions (not shown here), static variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and variable definitions, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import from a local module, defines a version string, and specifies the public API. It contains no user input, external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0 to 0.1). The code is typical for package setup, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The scores are consistent and appropriate given the static, harmless nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are accurate and reflect its safe nature.",
