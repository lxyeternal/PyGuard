  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a simple module initialization script that imports functions from a local module, sets version info, and defines the public API. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks. The code is straightforward and typical for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct, no obfuscation detected)  \n- Malware: 0 (correct, no malicious behavior)  \n- Security Risk: Ranges from 0.1 to 0 (very low, given the benign nature)  \n\nThese scores seem reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nAll scores are well below 0.5, aligning with the benign nature of the code. Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as network access, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n\n6. **Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports correctly avoid speculative claims. They focus on the code's actual behavior, which is safe.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the reports' findings. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to the import from a local module, but this is standard practice)\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\nThis code is a standard, benign module initialization snippet. No security concerns are evident, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Note:** Since the code is purely static import and metadata setup, the risk remains very low. No further action is needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, typical for package setup code)",
