  "purpose": "Module initialization that imports specific functions and defines module metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module, defining __version__ and __all__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; module setup is straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initializer that imports functions from a local module, sets version info, and defines exported symbols. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is present. The import is relative, indicating local module usage, and the code appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a typical package initialization script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
