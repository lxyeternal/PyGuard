  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple module initialization script, importing functions from a local module (.core), setting version info, and defining `__all__`.\n- No report indicates any suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or external network activity.\n- The code is standard for Python package setup, with no anomalies or security risks noted.\n- All confidence levels are 1, and malware scores are 0, which aligns with the benign description.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code only performs static imports and variable definitions.\n- There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no external outputs, no user input handling.\n- The relative import from `.core` is typical in package code, not suspicious.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed in any report.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- Security risk: very low (0.1 to 0), consistent with a harmless module setup.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code appears to be a standard, safe module initialization script.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or security issues.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- I agree with the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 (or very close to it).\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1 (reflecting minimal inherent risk in package setup, but not malicious)\n\nThis review confirms that the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
