{
  "purpose": "The code implements statistical procedures for multiple hypothesis testing correction, including q-value calculation, pi0 estimation, and local FDR estimation, using standard scientific libraries.",
  "sources": "The code reads input p-values provided by the user.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network communication, or malicious sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input p-values are processed through estimation functions (pi0est, lfdr) to produce q-values and lfdr estimates; no external or untrusted data flows outside these functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical calculations for multiple hypothesis correction, with proper input validation and use of well-established methods (smoothing splines, kernel density estimation). It relies solely on scientific libraries and processes user data without external communication. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The functions are transparent, correctly implemented, and follow accepted practices. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of multiple hypothesis testing correction procedures, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use in scientific and analytical contexts.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
