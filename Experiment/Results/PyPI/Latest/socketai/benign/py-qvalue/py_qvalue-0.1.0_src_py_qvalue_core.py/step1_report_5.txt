{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for estimating q-values, pi0 (proportion of true null hypotheses), and local false discovery rates (lfdr) in multiple hypothesis testing scenarios, primarily used in statistical analysis of p-values.",
  "sources": "Reads input p-value arrays, optional parameters for estimation methods, and intermediate computed values within functions (e.g., p-values, lambda values).",
  "sinks": "Outputs include q-values, lfdr values, and pi0 estimates, which could influence downstream decision-making or data interpretation if misused, but no direct sinks such as network or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "P-value arrays are used as sources; they are processed for pi0 estimation, q-value calculation, and lfdr estimation. Data flows through statistical calculations, smoothing, and kernel density estimation to produce final output metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are present. No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are detected. The code primarily uses statistical and mathematical libraries for analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical computations for multiple testing correction and false discovery rate estimation. It uses well-known libraries (numpy, scipy) for numerical and statistical operations, with proper input validation. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. All operations are typical for scientific analysis. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious dynamic behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of statistical methods for multiple hypothesis testing correction without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It leverages common scientific libraries and performs expected calculations with proper validation. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
