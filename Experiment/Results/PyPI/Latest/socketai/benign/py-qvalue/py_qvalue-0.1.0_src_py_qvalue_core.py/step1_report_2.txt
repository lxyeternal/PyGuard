{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for calculating q-values, estimating pi0 (the proportion of true null hypotheses), and computing local false discovery rates (lfdr) for multiple hypothesis testing correction.",
  "sources": "The code reads input p-value arrays from function parameters p, lambda_, and other arguments. It does not read external data or input sources outside the function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations based on input p-values; it does not write or send data externally. It does not contain network connections, file writing, or data exfiltration routines.",
  "flows": "Input p-values are processed through various statistical estimations (pi0 estimation, q-value computation, lfdr calculation). There are no external data sinks or command executions that could lead to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, hard-coded credentials, or obfuscated code, are present. The code uses standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy) for statistical analysis. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident. The functions are typical for statistical analysis in bioinformatics or multiple testing contexts.",
  "analysis": "The code implements statistical functions for multiple hypothesis testing correction, utilizing common libraries and straightforward algorithms. All calculations are standard, with no signs of malicious activity. No external network or system modification routines are included. The code appears legitimate and typical for scientific computation purposes. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of multiple testing correction procedures and local false discovery rate estimation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for its intended statistical analysis purpose.",
