      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard; no malicious or suspicious behavior is present within this code. The security risk and malware scores are appropriate, assuming the external 'main' function is safe. The package name alone does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe, and no modifications are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation. While the class name suggests potential malicious intent, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores should reflect minimal risk, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score. Further review of the actual implementation of 'BlackSpammerBD' is recommended if more context becomes available."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple file sharing utility with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious network activity. Its main security concern is potential misuse in untrusted environments due to minimal security controls. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate, with no evidence of malicious intent."
