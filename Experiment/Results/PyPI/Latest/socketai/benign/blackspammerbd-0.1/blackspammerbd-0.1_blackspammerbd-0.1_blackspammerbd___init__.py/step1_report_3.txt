  "purpose": "Importing the class 'BlackSpammerBD' from a local module named 'core', likely to perform spam-related or similar operations within the application.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement that references a local module '.core' and a class 'BlackSpammerBD'. No external input reading or data acquisition is evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no data output, network communication, or sensitive data handling occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from this single line of code, as it only performs an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The class name 'BlackSpammerBD' could suggest malicious intent, such as spam or abusive behavior, but this is only a class name and does not indicate behavior by itself. No suspicious code patterns or hardcoded secrets are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement. It does not include any executable logic, data handling, or network operations. The class name might imply malicious or spam-related functionality, but that cannot be confirmed solely from an import statement. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. The class name may warrant further review if the entire package is analyzed, but based solely on this line, there is no indication of malicious intent.",
