  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation. While the class name suggests potential malicious intent, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores should reflect minimal risk, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score. Further review of the actual implementation of 'BlackSpammerBD' is recommended if more context becomes available."
