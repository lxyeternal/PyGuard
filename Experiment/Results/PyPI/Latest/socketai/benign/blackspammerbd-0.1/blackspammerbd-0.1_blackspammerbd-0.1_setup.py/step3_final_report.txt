  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script defining package metadata and entry point for 'blackspammerbd'.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function parameters, including 'name', 'version', 'packages', 'install_requires', and 'entry_points'.",
  "sinks": "The 'entry_points' specifying 'blackspammerbd.core:main' as the executable entry point.",
  "flows": "When the 'bsb' command is executed, it invokes 'blackspammerbd.core:main', which is external to this script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and follows standard packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no suspicious imports, obfuscation, or embedded malicious logic. The actual behavior depends on the implementation of 'blackspammerbd.core:main', which is outside this code's scope. The package name 'blackspammerbd' could imply malicious intent but does not affect the benign nature of this script. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's content. The risk primarily hinges on external code, not the setup script itself.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard; no malicious or suspicious behavior is present within this code. The security risk and malware scores are appropriate, assuming the external 'main' function is safe. The package name alone does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe, and no modifications are necessary.",
