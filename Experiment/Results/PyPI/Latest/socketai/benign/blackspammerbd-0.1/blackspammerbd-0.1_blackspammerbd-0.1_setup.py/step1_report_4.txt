  "anomalies": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration using setuptools with no suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and uses it to configure package setup parameters. It defines package metadata, dependencies (none), and an entry point for a console script linked to 'blackspammerbd.core:main'. All syntax and structure are typical for Python package setup files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious logic. The script is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package setup script with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package with a console script entry point.",
