  "purpose": "A CLI utility for file sharing and management via a connection code, allowing listing, uploading, downloading, and sharing files.",
  "sources": "User input commands, filesystem operations (os.listdir, shutil.copy), connection code generation and validation.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem read/write operations, URL sharing with filenames, connection status checks.",
  "flows": "Input commands trigger methods that perform file operations or generate/share URLs, conditioned on connection status.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no network activity, no malicious payloads. Potential misuse due to minimal security controls, but no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward file management CLI with a simplistic connection mechanism. It does not contain obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or network activity. The connection code is generated randomly and validated locally. File operations are basic and do not involve external servers or encryption. The sharing URL exposes filenames but not content or sensitive data. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior. The security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to lack of authentication, encryption, and input validation, which could be exploited in insecure environments. Overall, the code poses minimal direct threat but could be misused if deployed insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple file sharing utility with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious network activity. Its main security concern is potential misuse in untrusted environments due to minimal security controls. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
