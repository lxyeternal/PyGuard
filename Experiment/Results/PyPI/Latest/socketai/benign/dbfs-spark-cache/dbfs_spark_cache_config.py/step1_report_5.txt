{
  "purpose": "Configuration settings for dbfs_spark_cache, including paths and database names.",
  "sources": "Environment variables loaded via pydantic_settings, default values set within the class.",
  "sinks": "Paths and database names used for cache storage, not directly exposed to untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and default values define configuration, with no external input flows that could lead to injection or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. Use of environment configuration is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a settings class for managing configuration parameters related to Spark cache paths and database names. All paths and database identifiers are hardcoded defaults with no indication of malicious intent. The class uses environment variables for configuration but does not process untrusted input or execute any dynamic code. The structure is straightforward and typical for configuration management, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class for managing cache settings with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages static and environment-based configuration data for a caching system.",
