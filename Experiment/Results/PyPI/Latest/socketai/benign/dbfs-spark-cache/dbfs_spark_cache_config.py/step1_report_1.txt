  "purpose": "Configuration settings for dbfs_spark_cache, managing cache directory paths and database parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables from .env file; uses default values assigned to class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (if any) influence class instantiation; default values are used directly without external input during runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets beyond simple default paths, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class using pydantic, with default paths and database names, and reads from a .env file. There are no suspicious data flows, no input handling beyond standard environment variable loading, and no insecure code practices are present. The code appears to be straightforward configuration without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only manages settings for cache directories and database names using defaults and environment variables, with no indicators of supply chain or malicious activity.",
