  "purpose": "Configuration setup for dbfs_spark_cache, defining paths, database names, and thresholds using pydantic.",
  "sources": "Environment variables loaded from .env file, default values for paths and thresholds.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code only reads environment variables and sets configuration parameters.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (sources) influence configuration parameters (sinks) via pydantic's environment loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple pydantic configuration class with default paths and database names, loading environment variables from a .env file. It contains no suspicious data flows, no external data leaks, and no malicious logic. The structure is clear, and the purpose is standard for configuration management. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The environment variable handling is typical and safe, with defaults provided. The code does not process untrusted input in a dangerous way, nor does it contain secrets or vulnerabilities. Overall, it is a benign configuration class with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
