  "purpose": "Configuration setup for dbfs_spark_cache, managing cache and database paths for a Spark environment.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (via pydantic_settings), default field values for paths and thresholds.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or potentially dangerous sink points.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or defaults flow into settings attributes, which are used internally for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic-based settings class for managing configuration paths and thresholds. It uses environment variable support via SettingsConfigDict. All values are standard configuration parameters for paths and thresholds, with no evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or security flaws. There are no input/output flows that pose risks, and no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated logic. The code appears to be straightforward configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical configuration module for managing paths and thresholds in a Spark caching context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe and aligned with standard practices.",
