{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup for dbfs_spark_cache, defining paths and database settings",
  "sources": "Environment variables (via pydantic settings), hardcoded default values",
  "sinks": "Potential use of paths and database names that could be exploited if misconfigured",
  "flows": "Environment variables or config defaults to settings object, used for cache and database paths",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; all configurations are standard and well-documented",
  "analysis": "The code uses pydantic to define configuration settings for a caching system, including directory paths and database names. No user input handling, data processing, or external data flows are present. The paths are hardcoded or environment-driven, typical for configuration files. No signs of malicious code such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup with no malicious intent. It manages paths and database settings for a cache system without including any suspicious or harmful logic.",
