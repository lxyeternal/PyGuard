  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, legitimate cache management system for Spark DataFrames, with no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, justified by filesystem operations that could be exploited if inputs are manipulated, but current safeguards are sufficient. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose."
