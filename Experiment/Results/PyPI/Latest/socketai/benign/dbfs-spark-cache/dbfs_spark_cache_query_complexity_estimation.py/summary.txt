  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Spark utility for estimating query complexity, relying on internal APIs and heuristic string analysis. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to internal API usage, which is typical in Spark diagnostics. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting low risk."
