  "purpose": "Utilities for estimating query complexity based on input file sizes and query plan analysis in PySpark.",
  "sources": "Input files via df.inputFiles(), query plan string via df._jdf.queryExecution().analyzed().toString()",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but potentially sensitive data could be read from input files or query plans, which are used internally for calculations",
  "flows": "Input files are read to determine sizes; query plan string is retrieved for complexity analysis; sizes and plan info flow into complexity calculations",
  "anomalies": "Access to internal Spark JVM objects and query plan string extraction might be considered sensitive or unusual; no explicit malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves input file paths and sizes using Spark's JVM interface, then estimates query complexity based on counts of specific SQL operations parsed from the query plan string. It performs straightforward calculations and exception handling, with no evident attempts to manipulate data, inject code, or exfiltrate information. The use of internal JVM calls could be considered unconventional, but is standard for Spark internal inspection. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious external network calls are detected. The logic appears purely analytical, with no malicious behavior or backdoors evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign estimation of query complexity based on file sizes and query plan analysis. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The use of internal JVM objects is typical for Spark analysis. No indicators of malware or sabotage are identified.",
