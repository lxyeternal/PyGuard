{
  "purpose": "This module exposes functions related to caching and complexity estimation for Spark dataframes, primarily for enhancing performance and analysis.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from the 'dbfs_spark_cache' package modules 'caching' and 'query_complexity_estimation'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or potentially leaked; the code only imports and exposes functions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing functions from other modules and defining an export list, with no data processing or flow from source to sink within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious constructs are present. The '__dir__' override is harmless and standard for module customization.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two functions and defines an '__all__' list for explicit exports. The override of '__dir__' returns this list, which is typical for controlling module introspection. No data manipulation, input reading, or security-sensitive operations are performed here. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign module that exposes selected functions from a package. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this code.",
