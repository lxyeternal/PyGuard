{
  "purpose": "This code is a package initializer for 'dbfs_spark_cache', exporting specific functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements for functions from internal modules: 'caching' and 'query_complexity_estimation'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems, no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from internal modules and defines __all__ for exported symbols. The __dir__ function returns the list of exported symbols. No external data sources, user input handling, or potentially malicious code segments are present. The code appears to be a straightforward module initializer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks identified.",
