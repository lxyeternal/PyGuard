  "purpose": "Module that re-exports specific functions from internal modules within the 'dbfs_spark_cache' package for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: 'dbfs_spark_cache.caching' and 'dbfs_spark_cache.query_complexity_estimation'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only exposes functions via __all__ and __dir__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from internal modules, defines an __all__ list for exports, and overrides __dir__() to return this list. It contains no data processing, input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code serves as a simple interface layer, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with full confidence. The code's simplicity and clarity support these conclusions, and there are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module interface with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
