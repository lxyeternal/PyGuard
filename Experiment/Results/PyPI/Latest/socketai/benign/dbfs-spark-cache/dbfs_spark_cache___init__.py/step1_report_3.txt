{
  "purpose": "To define and export functions from the dbfs_spark_cache package related to caching and query complexity estimation.",
  "sources": "The package imports from dbfs_spark_cache.caching and dbfs_spark_cache.query_complexity_estimation modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output handling is present; the code does not process external inputs or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks is observed; the code merely exports imported functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The __dir__ override is standard for custom module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing two functions from internal modules and exposing them via __all__. The __dir__ function customizes attribute listing, which is common in Python modules. No code execution, input handling, or suspicious operations are evident. The module appears to serve as an interface layer for other parts of the project, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module definition with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply imports and re-exports functions, with no external input processing or data leaks.",
