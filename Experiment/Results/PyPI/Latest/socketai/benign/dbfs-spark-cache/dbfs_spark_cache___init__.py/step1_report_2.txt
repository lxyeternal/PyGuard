{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a package that exports functions related to caching and estimating compute complexity for Spark dataframes in a DBFS environment.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from 'dbfs_spark_cache.caching' and 'dbfs_spark_cache.query_complexity_estimation'. No input data reading is evident in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it only exports functions and defines a __dir__ method.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily re-exports imported functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a module definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from submodules within the 'dbfs_spark_cache' package and exposes them via the '__all__' list. It also overrides the '__dir__' method to customize the module's attribute listing. The code does not perform any data processing, I/O, or execute dynamic code. No signs of malicious activity or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple package interface definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. It functions as a clean, standard module for exporting specific functions. There are no suspicious behaviors or security risks detected.",
