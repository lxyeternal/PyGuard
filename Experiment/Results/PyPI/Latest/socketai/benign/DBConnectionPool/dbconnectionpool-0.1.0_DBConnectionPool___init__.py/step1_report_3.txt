{
  "purpose": "The code imports all components from the local 'database' module, likely to utilize database-related functions or classes within the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the 'database' module within the package.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks could be functions or classes within 'database' that handle untrusted data, but the code itself does not specify any sinks.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows in this single-line import statement; data flow depends on subsequent usage of imported components.",
  "anomalies": "The import uses a wildcard '*', which can obscure which specific components are imported and may lead to namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement that brings all definitions from a local 'database' module into scope. No malicious behavior can be inferred solely from an import statement. The absence of further code makes it impossible to evaluate data handling, sinks, or malicious intent. The use of wildcard import is a potential concern for maintainability and clarity but not security.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports a module, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
