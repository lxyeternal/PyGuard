{
  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local database module",
  "sources": "The import statement sources all code and data from the database module within the same package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this line; potential sinks depend on how imported contents are used elsewhere",
  "flows": "The import brings in external code which could influence subsequent data flows, but no direct data flow can be determined from this line alone",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') is generally discouraged as it obscures imported names and can lead to unintended behavior, but it is not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement that imports all symbols from a local database module. This is a common pattern in Python projects. Without additional context or usage, it does not suggest malicious activity. The statement itself does not execute untrusted code or contain obfuscated logic. Since only this line is provided, it is not possible to identify malicious behavior solely based on the import statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The main concern is the use of a wildcard import, which can lead to maintenance and security issues if the imported module contains malicious or unintended code. Overall, the risk appears low based solely on this line.",
