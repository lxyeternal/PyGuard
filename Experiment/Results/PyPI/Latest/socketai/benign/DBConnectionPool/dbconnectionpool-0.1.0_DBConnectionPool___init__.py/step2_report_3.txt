  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code snippets, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a simple import statement (`from .database import *` or similar).\n- No actual code execution, data flow, or network activity is shown.\n- Use of wildcard import (`*`) is noted as a potential maintainability concern but not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent is present in the code snippets.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Code:** `from .database import *`\n- **Assessment:** Correct; it's a standard relative import. No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Code:** `from .database import *`\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no malicious activity, just a wildcard import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 (minor concern about wildcard), confidence=0.8\n- **Verdict:** Slightly higher securityRisk due to wildcard import concern, but still low.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Code:** `from .database import *`\n- **Assessment:** Same reasoning; wildcard import may cause namespace pollution but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 (slightly higher, acknowledging maintainability issues), confidence=0.7\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable, though the risk score is slightly elevated for maintainability concerns.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Code:** `from .database import *`\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Verdict:** Consistent; wildcard import is a concern but not security risk.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Code:** `from .database import *`\n- **Assessment:** Same; no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.6\n- **Verdict:** Similar to previous; the main concern is the wildcard import.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  No significant errors. The reports are consistent and acknowledge the limitations of analyzing only an import statement.\n\n- **Scores analysis:**  \n  - **Malware:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, correct.  \n  - **Security risk:** Slightly elevated in some reports due to wildcard import concerns, which is reasonable but not a security risk per se.\n\n- **Should any scores be adjusted?**  \n  - The malware score should remain 0.  \n  - The obfuscated score is correctly 0.  \n  - The security risk scores are acceptable, considering maintainability issues but not security threats.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  Since no malicious code or obfuscation is present, risk scores above 0.5 are unjustified.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions?**  \n  The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent solely based on the import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the context, a risk score around 0.1-0.2 is justified mainly due to maintainability concerns with wildcard imports, but not security risks.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the wildcard import, but minimal security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The main point is that the code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No further adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward relative import with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The risk scores are slightly elevated due to the wildcard import but do not indicate security issues. I agree with the assessments provided.",
