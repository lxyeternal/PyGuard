  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Code:** `from .database import *`  \n- **Analysis:** This is a standard relative import of all symbols from a local module named 'database'. No suspicious behavior, no data flow, no malware indicators.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; this is a typical import statement with no security concern.  \n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate scoring.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Code:** `from .database import *`  \n- **Analysis:** Same as above, import all from local module. No signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.8  \n- **Assessment:** The small security risk score (0.1) seems to reflect concern over wildcard import, which can cause namespace pollution, but not malicious activity.  \n- **Verdict:** **Reasonable.** The risk score is low but acknowledges potential maintainability issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Code:** `from .database import *`  \n- **Analysis:** Same import pattern, wildcard import. No malicious activity inferred.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.7  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score due to wildcard import concerns is acceptable. No malware indicated.  \n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Code:** `from .database import *`  \n- **Analysis:** Same as above.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.9  \n- **Assessment:** The high confidence aligns with the straightforward import; no issues.  \n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Code:** `from .database import *`  \n- **Analysis:** Same pattern, wildcard import.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.6  \n- **Assessment:** The risk score reflects potential namespace pollution, not malicious intent.  \n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Observations:\n\n- All reports analyze the same code snippet: a relative import with wildcard in most cases.  \n- None of the reports identify actual malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.  \n- The malware scores are all zero, which is consistent and appropriate given the code.  \n- The risk scores are low, reflecting potential maintainability issues rather than security threats, which is reasonable.  \n- Confidence levels are high where applicable, matching the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Given the code, all scores should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0; the code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher for wildcard import (up to 0.2), which is acceptable, but should not be higher than 0.3 unless additional context suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.2** (to account for wildcard import concerns but no actual security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code provided. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary. The code snippet itself is benign, and the assessments are appropriate.",
