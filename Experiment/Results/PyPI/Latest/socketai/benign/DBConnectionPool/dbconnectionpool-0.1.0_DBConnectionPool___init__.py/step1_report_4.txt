  "sinks": "No sinks present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed within this line.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .database import *' can lead to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple import statement that includes all definitions from the 'database' module in the current package. The use of a relative import indicates it's part of a package. Since this line alone does not execute any code or handle data directly, it doesn't exhibit any malicious behavior. Without additional context or the contents of 'database', no malicious activity or security issues are evident here. The only potential concern is the use of wildcard import, which can obscure code behavior but is not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports all components from the 'database' module. There are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies detected in this line.",
