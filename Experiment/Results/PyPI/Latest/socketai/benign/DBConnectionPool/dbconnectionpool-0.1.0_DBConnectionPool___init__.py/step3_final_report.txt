  "purpose": "Evaluate the security implications of the code snippet 'from .database import *' in the context of supply chain security for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which reads symbols from a local module named 'database'.",
  "sinks": "Potential namespace pollution or inclusion of malicious code if 'database' contains harmful content; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The import source flows into the namespace of the module, potentially affecting subsequent code execution if 'database' is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*'), which can cause namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of all symbols from a local module. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident solely from this line. The wildcard import is a maintainability concern but does not constitute malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the context. Confidence is high due to the simplicity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified, and the malware score remains at zero. The wildcard import, while discouraged, does not indicate security issues. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk.",
