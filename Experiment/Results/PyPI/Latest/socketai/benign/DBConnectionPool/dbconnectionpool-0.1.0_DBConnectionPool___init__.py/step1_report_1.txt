  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the local 'database' module",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from .database",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling shown in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible from a single import statement",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import; no suspicious or unusual syntax or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement, which loads the contents of a local module named 'database'. There are no other operations, data processing, or network activity. Relative imports are common in package modules to organize code. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is evident in this single line. Since no further context or code is provided, this appears to be standard module import syntax.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is typical for Python packages to import modules in this manner. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
