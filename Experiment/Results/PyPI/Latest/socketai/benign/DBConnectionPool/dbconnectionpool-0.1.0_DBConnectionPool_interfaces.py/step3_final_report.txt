  "purpose": "Define an interface for connection pooling with abstract methods for connecting, disconnecting, executing SQL, and selecting data.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only abstract method declarations without data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows, external calls, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is purely an interface with method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard abstract base class defining an interface with four abstract methods. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, structural component without malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with its nature. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured interface definition with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores and assessments are appropriate and do not require changes.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
