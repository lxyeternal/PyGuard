  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for a connection pool with methods for connecting, disconnecting, running SQL, and selecting data.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; the code only defines an interface.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are evident as this is only an abstract class declaration.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs present.",
  "analysis": "This code defines an abstract base class with four abstract methods related to database connection management and SQL operations. It does not contain executable logic, data handling, or external data interaction. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent, as it is purely a structural interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward abstract interface with no signs of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation. It serves as a blueprint for subclasses implementing connection pool functionality.",
