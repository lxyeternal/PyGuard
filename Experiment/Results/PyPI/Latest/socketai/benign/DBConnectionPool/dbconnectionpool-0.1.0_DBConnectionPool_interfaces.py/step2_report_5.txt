  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines an abstract base class `ConnectionPoolInterface` with four abstract methods: `_connect`, `_disconnect`, `runsql`, and `select`.\n- There is no executable logic, data input/output, or external interactions.\n- The code is a standard interface template, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is a straightforward interface with no malicious or security-related concerns.\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct and follows Python conventions for abstract classes.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Logical flaws:** None. The code correctly uses ABC and abstractmethod decorators.\n- **Security flaws:** None. No secrets, external calls, or data handling.\n- **Obfuscation or malware:** None detected.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is purely structural, serving as an interface.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- All reports correctly identify this as a benign interface definition.\n- No report suggests any hidden or malicious intent, and their assessments are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured abstract interface with no security issues.\n- The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It functions as a simple interface template for subclasses.",
