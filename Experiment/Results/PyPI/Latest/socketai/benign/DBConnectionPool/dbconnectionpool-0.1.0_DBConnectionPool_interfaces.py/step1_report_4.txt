  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for a connection pool with methods for connecting, disconnecting, running SQL, and selecting data.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read directly in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, especially no untrusted data handling or external connections are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows as the code only defines an interface with abstract methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for an interface definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the ABC module to define an abstract base class 'ConnectionPoolInterface'. It declares four abstract methods: '_connect', '_disconnect', 'runsql', and 'select'. These methods are placeholders meant to be implemented in subclasses. The code does not include any implementation, external data handling, or suspicious activity. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard interface definition for a connection pool, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply establishes method signatures for subclasses to implement. Overall, the code appears safe and conventional.",
