  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for a connection pool with methods for connecting, disconnecting, running SQL queries, and selecting data.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data; it only declares an interface.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or data processing in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; this is purely an interface declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class 'ConnectionPoolInterface' with four abstract methods: _connect, _disconnect, runsql, and select. It includes docstrings describing its purpose. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external calls, and no logic or executable code beyond method declarations. The structure is typical for interface definitions in Python using ABC. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface definition for a connection pool, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured component template.",
