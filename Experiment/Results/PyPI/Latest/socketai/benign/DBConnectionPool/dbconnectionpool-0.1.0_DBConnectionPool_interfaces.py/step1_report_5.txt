{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for a database connection pool with methods for connecting, disconnecting, running SQL, and selecting data.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; no data input sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or written to external systems within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists within this snippet as it only defines an interface with abstract methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and only contains an interface definition with abstract methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class 'ConnectionPoolInterface' with four abstract methods: _connect, _disconnect, runsql, and select. It serves as an interface for database connection pooling, with no executable code or data handling implemented. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. Usage of abstract methods suggests this is a design pattern rather than operational code, reducing risk for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard interface definition for database connection pooling without any malicious intent or security concerns. It does not include any code that could be exploited or used maliciously.",
