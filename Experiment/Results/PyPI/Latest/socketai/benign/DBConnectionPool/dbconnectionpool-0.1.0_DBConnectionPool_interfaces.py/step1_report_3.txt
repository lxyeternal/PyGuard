  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for a database connection pool with methods for connecting, disconnecting, executing SQL, and selecting data.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code defines an interface with method signatures only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling occurs within this abstract interface.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only abstract method definitions without implementation, which is normal for interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class with four method signatures meant for subclasses to implement. There are no actual data handling, no input/output operations, and no suspicious or malicious code. It adheres to standard Python practices for interface definition. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code's purpose is purely structural, providing an interface for database connection pools.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward abstract interface with no malicious behavior or security issues. It functions as a standard design pattern to specify method signatures for subclasses. There are no anomalies or security concerns in this snippet.",
