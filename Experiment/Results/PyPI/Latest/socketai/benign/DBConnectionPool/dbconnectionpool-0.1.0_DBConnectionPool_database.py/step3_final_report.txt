  "purpose": "A class for managing MySQL database connection pooling, executing SQL commands, and fetching data securely using parameterized queries.",
  "sources": "Connection parameters (host, user, password, database, port), SQL query strings provided to runsql() and select() methods.",
  "sinks": "Execution of SQL commands via cursor.execute(), data returned through cursor.fetchall(), connection close operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into connection setup; SQL statements and placeholders flow into execute(); results flow back into Python data structures; connection close functions are invoked after operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. Proper use of parameterized queries reduces injection risk. No covert channels or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard connection pool with safe query execution. It employs parameterized queries in runsql() to prevent SQL injection. Connection management is handled correctly with cleanup in select() and runsql(). No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code structure and library usage are typical for such utilities. The primary security concern is correct usage by callers to ensure parameterization, but the code itself is secure. No anomalies or malicious indicators are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, well-structured database connection pool implementation with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, contingent on proper usage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting standard low-risk database utility code.",
