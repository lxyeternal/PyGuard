The empty reports are likely due to report generation issues rather than security concerns. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall risk should be set to zero, reflecting the absence of evidence of malicious activity."

The scores should reflect this benign nature, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and the security risk score at 0. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is slightly overstated; it should be 0 for consistency."
