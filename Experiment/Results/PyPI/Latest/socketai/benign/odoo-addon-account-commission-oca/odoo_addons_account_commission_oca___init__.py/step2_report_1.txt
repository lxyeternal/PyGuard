  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Assessment:** The code is only import statements with no additional logic.\n   - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1\n   - **Justification:** The minimal code is unlikely to be malicious. The low security risk score (0.1) seems reasonable given the absence of any suspicious activity.\n   - **Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Assessment:** Same as above; straightforward import statements.\n   - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n   - **Justification:** No security issues or obfuscation. Zero risk is justified.\n   - **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Assessment:** Same as previous; only import statements.\n   - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n   - **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity.\n   - **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Assessment:** Again, only relative import statements, no suspicious activity.\n   - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n   - **Justification:** No security concern.\n   - **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Assessment:** Same as others; just import statements.\n   - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n   - **Justification:** No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n   - **Verdict:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in report 1 (0.1), which is reasonable given the minimal code. Others are zero, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the code provided.\n- Since the code is purely import statements with no suspicious or malicious activity, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very minimal, given the trivial code)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, and the scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
