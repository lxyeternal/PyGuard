  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code in question is purely import statements:\n  ```python\n  from . import models\n  from . import wizards\n  from . import report\n  ```\n- There is no data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code is minimal, typical for Python package structure.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature, assigning high confidence and zero malware and obfuscation scores.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code only contains import statements, which are benign in isolation.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as harmless.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 or very close to 0\n  - Confidence: 1 or 0.9\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes, given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, these scores are appropriate.\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- The minimal code and lack of external interactions justify zero or near-zero scores.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- Since no malicious behavior is present, malware score should remain at 0.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- The code only imports modules; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n| Metric             | Score  |\n|--------------------|---------|\n| Malware            | 0       |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       |\n| Risk               | 0       |\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.",
