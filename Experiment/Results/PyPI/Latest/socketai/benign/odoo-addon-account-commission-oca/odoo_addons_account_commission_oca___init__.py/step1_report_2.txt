{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules named models, wizards, and report from the same package, likely for organizing and accessing different components of a larger application.",
  "sources": "Module imports: .models, .wizards, .report",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, external data output, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond importing modules; no source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement structure that imports three internal modules within the same package. It contains no data processing, user input handling, or external communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. The simplicity indicates standard package organization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of normal package structure setup.",
