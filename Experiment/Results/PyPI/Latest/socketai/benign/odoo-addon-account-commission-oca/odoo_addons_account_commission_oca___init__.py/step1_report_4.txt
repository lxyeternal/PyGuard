{
  "purpose": "Import modules related to models, wizards, and reports within a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements at the beginning of the code, importing from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks observed; imports are static and do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only import statements with relative imports; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three relative import statements, which are standard Python practices for modular code organization. No code execution, data processing, or network activities are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The simplicity and conventional nature of the code suggest it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of relative import statements with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It does not perform any data handling or execution beyond importing modules, thus presenting minimal security concern.",
