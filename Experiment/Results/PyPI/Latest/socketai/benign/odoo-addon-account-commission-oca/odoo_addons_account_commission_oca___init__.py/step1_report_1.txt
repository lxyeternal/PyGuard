{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules named models, wizards, and report from the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statements at the beginning of the file",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules, but do not process untrusted data or user input",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements with no additional logic, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting only of relative import statements. It does not include any data processing, user input handling, or network communication. This simplicity suggests standard module importing, with no obvious signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The absence of any code that interacts with external systems or sensitive data reduces the likelihood of malicious intent. The structure and syntax are typical for Python packages, indicating normal module import practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward import of modules within a package, with no harmful or malicious intent apparent.",
