{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules named models, wizards, and report, likely to organize functionality within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (relative imports)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or data leakage points identified",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; just module imports without data processing or transfer",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three import statements using relative imports to include local modules named models, wizards, and report. There is no dynamic code execution, input handling, or data processing. The structure appears to be standard for modular Python applications and does not exhibit obfuscation, malicious code, or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a module import declaration with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
