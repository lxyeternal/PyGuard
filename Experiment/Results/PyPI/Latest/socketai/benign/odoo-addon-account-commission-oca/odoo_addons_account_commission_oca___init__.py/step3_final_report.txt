{
  "purpose": "The code performs simple relative import statements for modules models, wizards, and report, typical for package organization.",
  "sources": "The import statements themselves, which read module references within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only imports modules without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three relative import statements, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of such import statements. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and security risk is negligible (~0.0-0.1). Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1), given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores are consistent with the code's benign and structural purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only module import statements with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores across reports are accurate and appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.05,
