  "purpose": "This code imports modules related to account movement, commission, and commission settlement, likely as part of a larger financial or accounting application.",
  "sources": "Import statements referencing internal modules: account_move, commission, commission_settlement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling mechanisms are present; the code only imports modules.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs within these import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements with no additional logic, secrets, or obfuscated code. No anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting only of relative import statements. No untrusted data sources, no data sinks, or suspicious operations. Import statements alone do not indicate malicious intent, especially when importing legitimate modules within a project. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The simplicity suggests standard modular design for an application related to accounting or finance.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as module imports for a larger application. No malicious activity, anomalies, or security risks are evident based on these import statements alone.",
