  "purpose": "The code appears to import modules related to account movements, commissions, and settlement processes, likely for a financial or accounting application.",
  "sources": "Module imports from the current package (account_move, commission, commission_settlement).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output, network communication, or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; only static imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements within a package, indicating modular design. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network activity, or dynamic code execution. This minimal import structure does not suggest malicious intent or malicious behavior. The absence of functions, data handling, or code logic limits any potential threat assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is standard module import statements for a package dealing with accounting or financial operations.",
