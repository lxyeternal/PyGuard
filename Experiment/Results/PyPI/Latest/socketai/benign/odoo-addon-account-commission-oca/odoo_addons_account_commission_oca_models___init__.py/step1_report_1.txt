{
  "purpose": "The code is importing three modules: account_move, commission, and commission_settlement, likely for use within a larger package or module.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules: . import account_move, . import commission, . import commission_settlement",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present in the code snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only import statements are present, with no data flow or untrusted data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors observed; import statements are standard and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three relative import statements, importing modules from the same package. There are no functions, data handling, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious code patterns are evident. The structure and content are typical for modular Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module import section with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a standard practice for organizing code into multiple modules within a package.",
