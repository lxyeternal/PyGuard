  "purpose": "A minimal import statement importing 'commission_analysis' from the current package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or input points are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard Python import statement with no additional logic, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0. The confidence levels are high, and scores are consistent with the minimal and benign nature of the code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. Given the lack of complexity or external interactions, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.",
