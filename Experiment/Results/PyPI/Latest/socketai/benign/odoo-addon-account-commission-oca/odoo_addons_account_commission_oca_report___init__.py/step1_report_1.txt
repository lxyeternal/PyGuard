  "purpose": "Import a module named commission_analysis within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement, which reads the commission_analysis module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not perform any operations that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as the code only contains an import statement with no further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; there are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named commission_analysis from the current package. There are no additional operations, data handling, or network activity. The simplicity suggests it is a standard import statement with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. Lack of further code makes it impossible to evaluate any dynamic or runtime behavior, but based solely on this snippet, there is no indication of malicious or maliciously intended actions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The code is minimal and standard.",
