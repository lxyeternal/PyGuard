  "purpose": "This code imports modules related to commission settlement and wizard invoice functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the current package, which may load additional code when executed.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution paths are evident within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only performing relative imports with no additional logic; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from the same package. There is no data processing, no input handling, and no execution of untrusted code within this fragment. As it stands, the code appears standard and benign. However, the actual behavior depends on the content of the imported modules, which are not provided here. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activities within these lines.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, the code performs simple module imports with no malicious intent or security risks identified. The overall security risk is very low. However, a full assessment of the imported modules would be necessary for a comprehensive review.",
