{
  "purpose": "The code imports two modules, 'commission_make_settle' and 'wizard_invoice', from the current package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module imports from the local package directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network connections, file writes, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident since the code only performs static imports without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only performing module imports with relative paths; no suspicious or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two relative import statements, which are typical in package modules to organize code dependencies. No user input, untrusted data, or dynamic code execution present. The imports themselves do not indicate malicious behavior; they are standard Python practices. Since there are no further operations, no suspicious or malicious actions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module import with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
