{
  "purpose": "The code performs relative imports of modules 'commission_make_settle' and 'wizard_invoice' within a package, likely for modular functionality in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading modules from the same package",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leakage or external communication present",
  "flows": "None; the code only imports modules without executing or passing data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; minimal and straightforward import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two relative import statements, which are standard in Python packages. There is no execution, data handling, or network activity. The imported modules' content is unknown, but the import pattern itself is benign. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Given the simplicity, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1). Confidence in benign nature is high (around 0.9). The assessments across reports are consistent and accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only standard import statements with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
