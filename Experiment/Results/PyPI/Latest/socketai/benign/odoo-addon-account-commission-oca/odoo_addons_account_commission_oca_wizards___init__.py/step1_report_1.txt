{
  "purpose": "The code imports two modules: commission_make_settle and wizard_invoice, likely for executing related functionalities within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the current package, which are not direct data sources but could contain sensitive operations or data.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; the code only imports modules without executing or passing data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The snippet contains only two import statements from relative modules, indicating typical modular code structure. No evidence of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or suspicious activities is present. Since the code is minimal, it does not include any complex logic, data processing, or network communication. The import statements themselves are standard in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malware or security risks. It is a standard module import pattern, and there are no indications of malicious intent or security concerns.",
