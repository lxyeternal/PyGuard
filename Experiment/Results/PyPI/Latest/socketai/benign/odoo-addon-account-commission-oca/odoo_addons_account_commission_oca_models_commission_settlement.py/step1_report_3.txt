{
  "purpose": "The code extends Odoo models to manage commission settlements and invoice generation, primarily to facilitate commission accounting workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads include environment variables (self.env), user context, data from related models (invoice lines, settlement dates), and external modules like odoo.tools.groupby.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to models (create, write, unlink), and actions invoke window views or move type switches; no external network communication or system modifications are observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input or related model fields into methods that compute invoice data, then into model creation and updates, with no evidence of external data exfiltration or malicious data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. Use of environment variables is standard. No obfuscation or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Odoo model extensions for commission management: it handles state transitions, invoice preparation, grouping logic, and related computations. It relies on environment variables, model relations, and standard Odoo methods. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data theft, external network communication, or system sabotage. The only potential concern might be the lack of validation for some fields, but this is typical in Odoo models and does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate extension of Odoo's commission and invoice workflow modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It functions to manage invoice generation and settlement states securely without external or hidden malicious actions.",
