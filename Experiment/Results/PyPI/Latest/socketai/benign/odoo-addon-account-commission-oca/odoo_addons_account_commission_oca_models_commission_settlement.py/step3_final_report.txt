{
  "purpose": "Extends Odoo's commission.settlement model to include invoice management, state transitions, and related invoicing workflows.",
  "sources": "Database ORM queries, environment variables, related models (e.g., agent_id, currency_id), user inputs via method calls.",
  "sinks": "Creation and modification of account.move and account.move.line records, state updates, user interface actions, external invoice generation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-initiated actions or scheduled processes to record creation/update, invoice generation, and state transitions, with filtering and grouping logic applied.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected. Use of standard ORM and environment variables is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard extension of Odoo models for managing commissions and invoicing. It employs safe ORM practices, standard filtering, grouping, and state management. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The functions perform expected business operations, including invoice creation, cancellation checks, and state transitions, with appropriate validations. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed. The security implications are minimal, and the code aligns with typical ERP extension patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. The low malware (0), obfuscation (0), and risk (0.1) scores are justified based on the analysis. Overall, the supply chain security of this dependency appears sound.",
