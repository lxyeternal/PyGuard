  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Odoo module manifest with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The empty reports are likely due to report generation issues rather than security concerns. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall risk should be set to zero, reflecting the absence of evidence of malicious activity."
