  "purpose": "Extend the 'commission' model by adding an 'invoice_state' selection field to specify invoice settlement behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; defines a static selection field within the model.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external communications; purely declarative model extension.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static field definition with no dynamic or external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard Odoo model extension with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple inheritance of an existing Odoo model, adding a static selection field with options 'open' and 'paid'. It uses standard ORM practices, with no external inputs, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The purpose is purely to add a configuration option for invoice settlement. No security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present. The minimal nature of the code indicates a benign intent, with no data leaks or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard extension of an Odoo model, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores should reflect this benign nature, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and the security risk score at 0. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is slightly overstated; it should be 0 for consistency.",
