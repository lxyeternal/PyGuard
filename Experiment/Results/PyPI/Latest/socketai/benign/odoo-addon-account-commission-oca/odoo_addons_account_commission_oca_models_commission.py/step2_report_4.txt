  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the provided assessments.\n\n**Overall code review:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward extension of an Odoo model, adding a single selection field `invoice_state`.\n- No external inputs, user inputs, or untrusted data sources are involved.\n- The code uses standard Odoo ORM practices, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose is purely to add a configuration option for invoice settlement behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code matches the description: extending the `commission` model with an `invoice_state` field.\n- The field choices (`\"open\"` and `\"paid\"`) are static, predefined, and have helpful descriptions.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.\n\n### Issues in the reports:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk score assigned in report 3 is `0.1`, which seems inconsistent with the overall benign assessment; it should be `0` given the lack of any security concern.\n- The malware score is consistently `0` across reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The risk score should be `0` for all reports, as there are no vulnerabilities or security concerns.\n- The malware score remains `0`, which is correct.\n- The confidence level is 1, which is appropriate given the clear, straightforward code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk score:** 0 (corrected from 0.1 in report 3)  \n**Overall risk score:** Given the benign nature, it should be very low, ideally close to 0.\n\n**Justification:**\n- No malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- No external data handling or network activity.\n- The code is a standard model extension for configuration purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports correctly identify the code as benign. The only inconsistency is the minor security risk score in report 3, which should be corrected to 0. All other scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- Update the security risk score in report 3 to 0.\n- Confirm that malware and obfuscated scores remain at 0.\n- Overall, the code is safe, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion, my estimated scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a benign, standard extension with no security issues.",
