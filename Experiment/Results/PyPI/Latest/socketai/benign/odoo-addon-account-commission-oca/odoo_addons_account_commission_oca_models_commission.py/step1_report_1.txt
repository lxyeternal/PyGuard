{
  "purpose": "Extend the existing 'commission' model in Odoo by adding an 'invoice_state' field to specify how commissions are settled.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for the field choices and the default value, and references the 'commission' model.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user inputs, or external outputs are present; no data is being written or transmitted from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The 'invoice_state' field is set with a default value and predefined choices, with no external data flow or user input handling beyond field definition.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Odoo module patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply inherits the 'commission' model and adds a selection field to specify invoice settlement status. There are no inputs from external sources, no data transmission, and no dynamic execution or obfuscated logic. The code appears to be a standard model extension for configuring invoice settlement preferences.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign model extension with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a functional purpose within an Odoo module without any suspicious or harmful elements.",
