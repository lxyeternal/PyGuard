{
  "purpose": "Extend the existing 'commission' model in Odoo to add an 'invoice_state' field for tracking invoice status.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'odoo', reading class definitions, and field declarations.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no external output, network, or data manipulation that could leak information.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified; the code merely defines a data field with default and help text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Odoo modules and adds a new selection field to a model. It is straightforward and well-documented, with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no input sources like user input or external data streams that could be exploited. No sink points for data leakage or malicious actions are present. The code is a standard model extension with a descriptive help text.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Odoo model extension with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger application to manage commission states based on invoice status.",
