{
  "purpose": "Extend the existing 'commission' model in Odoo to include an 'invoice_state' field for tracking invoice-based or payment-based settlement of commissions.",
  "sources": "Import of 'fields' and 'models' from Odoo; definition of the 'Commission' class and the 'invoice_state' field.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform critical operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the code only defines a data model extension.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears standard for an Odoo module extension.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that inherits from an existing model ('commission') and adds a new selection field 'invoice_state' with options 'open' and 'paid'. The code is straightforward, uses standard Odoo ORM practices, and includes helpful comments and default values. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or data leaks are evident. It is a typical extension for configuring invoice settlement behavior.\n\nThe code does not contain any external data input handling, network operations, or security-sensitive logic that could be exploited. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.\n\nGiven the simplicity and clarity of the code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Odoo model extension adding a configuration option. There are no malicious behaviors, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns detected. It appears safe and aligns with common Odoo development practices.",
