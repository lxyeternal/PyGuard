  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard extension of an Odoo model, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores should reflect this benign nature, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and the security risk score at 0. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is slightly overstated; it should be 0 for consistency."
