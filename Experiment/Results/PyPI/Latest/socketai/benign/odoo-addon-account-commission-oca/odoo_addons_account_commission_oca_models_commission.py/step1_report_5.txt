{
  "purpose": "Extend the 'commission' model to include an 'invoice_state' field for tracking invoice or payment-based settlement status.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'fields' module (imported from 'odoo') and the class definition which inherits from 'commission'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; the code primarily defines a model extension with no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; the code sets default values and help descriptions for a model field.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code is straightforward model extension.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from Odoo, extends an existing model 'commission' by adding a new field 'invoice_state'. This field is a selection type with predefined options and descriptive help text. The implementation appears standard for an Odoo module and does not include any suspicious or malicious patterns. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no external network calls, or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical extension of an Odoo model to add a new field for invoice status. It contains no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is safe and intended for standard application functionality.",
