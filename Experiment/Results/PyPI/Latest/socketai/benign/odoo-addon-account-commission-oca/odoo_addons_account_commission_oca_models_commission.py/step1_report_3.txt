{
  "purpose": "Extend the 'commission' model in Odoo to include a new field 'invoice_state' that indicates whether commissions are settled based on invoice issuance or payment.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it defines a new model field.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code simply defines a static model extension.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard for an Odoo module. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Odoo model extension defining a selection field for invoice state. No external inputs, no data manipulation, no network operations, and no dynamic code execution. It adheres to standard practices without any anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign extension of an Odoo model to add a descriptive field. No malicious intent or security issues are present in this code.",
