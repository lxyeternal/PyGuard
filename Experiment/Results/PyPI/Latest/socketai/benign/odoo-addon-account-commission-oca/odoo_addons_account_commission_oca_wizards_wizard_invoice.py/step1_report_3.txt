  "purpose": "A wizard for creating invoices from commission settlements in Odoo.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment context, user input via form fields, and search queries for settlements.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if settlement IDs or invoice data are exposed externally; invoice creation is a critical sink.",
  "flows": "Settlement IDs are fetched from context or default method, then used in search and invoice creation, with data flowing from user/context input to database operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of standard Odoo ORM methods and domain filters appears normal. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a transient model for invoice creation with standard methods for default values, validation, and invoice generation. It relies on environment data and user input to filter settlements. All data flows involve standard ORM operations. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The invoice creation process appears straightforward and aligned with typical Odoo practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Odoo wizard implementation for invoicing settlements. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on this code snippet.",
