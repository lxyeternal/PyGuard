  "purpose": "Wizard for creating invoices from commission settlements in Odoo",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (env), context, user input (fields), and database records (search, browse, filtered_domain)",
  "sinks": "Creates invoices via the make_invoices method, raises UserError exceptions, returns action dictionaries for UI navigation",
  "flows": "User triggers button_create -> reads settlement data -> creates invoices -> returns UI action",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external network calls or file operations; uses standard Odoo ORM methods and exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines a transient model for invoice creation from settlements, including default value functions, domain filters, and a button action to generate invoices. All data access is via standard ORM queries and context-aware methods. No signs of malicious data exfiltration, external communication, or backdoors are present. Exception handling is for user feedback, not malicious purposes. The overall structure follows standard Odoo practices. The only potential concern is reliance on user-provided data and context, but it is typical for such wizards. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Odoo wizard implementation for invoice creation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
