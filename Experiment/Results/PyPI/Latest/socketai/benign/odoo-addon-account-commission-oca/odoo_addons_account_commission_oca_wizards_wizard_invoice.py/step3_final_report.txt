  "purpose": "A wizard in Odoo for creating purchase invoices from settled commission settlements, utilizing environment context, user inputs, and ORM methods.",
  "sources": "Reads environment context, user-selected settlement IDs, and form fields such as journal, product, date, and grouping options.",
  "sinks": "Calls the 'make_invoices' method on settlement records to generate invoices; no external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "User triggers 'button_create' -> retrieves settlements -> calls 'make_invoices' -> returns action window displaying created invoices.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated patterns, or external calls detected. Uses standard ORM and environment data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an Odoo wizard. It filters settlements based on environment context and user input, then creates invoices via a method call. No malicious logic, obfuscation, or external network activity is present. The reliance on environment data and user input is typical for such modules and does not introduce security issues. The code raises user errors for invalid states, aligning with standard practices. Overall, the code is secure, transparent, and free from malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Odoo wizard for invoice creation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
