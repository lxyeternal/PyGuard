  "purpose": "Wizard for creating invoices from settled commissions in Odoo.",
  "sources": "User input from context, environment variables (env), active model, active IDs, domain filters, default values.",
  "sinks": "Database queries (search, browse), method calls (make_invoices), returning actions for UI navigation.",
  "flows": "User triggers button_create() -> fetches settlements -> calls make_invoices() -> returns invoice actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of standard Odoo ORM and fields. Domain filters and default methods are typical. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a transient model with fields for selecting a journal, product, settlement records, and other options. It includes methods to set default values based on context or existing records. The button_create method generates invoices from settlements and returns a UI action. All interactions are standard for an Odoo module handling financial transactions. No signs of malicious data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are observed. The code relies on Odoo's ORM and standard methods, with no suspicious external calls or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Odoo wizard for creating invoices from settlements. It follows typical patterns and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or malware indicators are present.",
