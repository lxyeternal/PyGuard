  "purpose": "Wizard for creating purchase invoices from settled commissions",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment context ('active_model', 'active_ids', 'settlement_ids') and user inputs via fields (journal_id, product_id, date, grouped).",
  "targets": "Potential data leaks or manipulation can occur if untrusted data is used improperly in domain filters, default values, or in the creation of invoices, especially via settlement IDs.",
  "flows": "Sources (context, environment data) are used to filter and select settlements, which then flow into the 'make_invoices' method to generate invoices.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. Domain filters and default methods rely on environment context but do not process untrusted external input directly.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a transient model for invoice creation, with default methods that retrieve data from environment context. It filters 'commission.settlement' records based on predefined criteria, and uses these to generate invoices. The code leverages Odoo's ORM and standard patterns for defaults and fields. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behavior detected. The data flow is controlled via domain filters and environment context, with no evident malicious intent or malicious code execution pathways.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Odoo wizard for invoice creation with no malicious behavior. It relies on environment context and standard ORM filters to operate securely. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
