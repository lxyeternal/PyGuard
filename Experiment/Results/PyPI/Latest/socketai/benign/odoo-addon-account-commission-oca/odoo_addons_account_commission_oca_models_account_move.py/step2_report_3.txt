  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard extension of Odoo models; reads from common models and fields.\n- **Sinks:** Modifies settlement states, computes totals, references views/actions—nothing suspicious.\n- **Flows:** Data flows are typical for business logic, no external calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears to implement standard business logic for commissions and settlements. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; reads from typical models and fields.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system calls or data exfiltration; standard ORM operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate extension; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on managing commissions, settlements, and invoice processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external calls; standard record manipulations.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical accounting extension, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 fit.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages commissions, settlements, agent associations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Record modifications, validations; no external system interaction.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard logic, low security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Extends accounting models; reads from standard fields.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Record updates, validation; no external calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical Odoo extension, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Malware score should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; remains at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The reports assign low risk (~0.1-0.2), which aligns with the analysis—business logic is standard, and no security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no evidence of malware)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1-0.2** (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Note:** The code appears to be a legitimate, standard extension of Odoo's accounting and commission modules, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                               |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior detected                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Code is clear, no obfuscation present                        |\n| Risk             | 0.1 - 0.2         | Low risk; standard business logic, no vulnerabilities     |\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
