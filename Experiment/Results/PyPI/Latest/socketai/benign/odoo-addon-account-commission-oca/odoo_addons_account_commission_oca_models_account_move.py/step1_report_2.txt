{
  "purpose": "This code extends Odoo models for managing commissions, settlements, and invoice lines, with focus on handling commissions, settlement states, and related computations.",
  "sources": "Reads data from model fields such as 'invoice_line_ids', 'partner_agent_ids', 'settlement_ids', and related references like 'env', 'mapped', 'ref', 'xmlid'.",
  "sinks": "Updates settlement states, computes totals, and references actions/views; no external system calls or network activity; no data leakage or credential handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input fields (sources) to computed fields and methods that update settlement states and compute totals; no untrusted input directly influences critical external actions or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is standard for an Odoo module, with proper use of decorators, field definitions, and model inheritance. No unusual or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard extensions to the Odoo framework, implementing computed fields, model relationships, and validation checks. It handles settlement states, commission calculations, and related logic securely, with proper use of constraints and dependencies. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The logic appears consistent with intended business functions, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Odoo module extension managing commissions and settlements without any malicious intent. It adheres to standard coding practices, with no signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily involving business logic rather than security flaws.",
