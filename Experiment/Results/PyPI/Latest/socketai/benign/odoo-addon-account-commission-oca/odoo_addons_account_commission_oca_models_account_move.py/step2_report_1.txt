  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard extension of Odoo models for commissions and settlements, primarily reading from ORM fields, environment, and context.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data is read and written via ORM methods, with no external system calls or suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code. Uses standard ORM and business logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical, legitimate extension with minimal security risk.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, due to standard business logic)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with focus on handling settlement states, commissions, and validations. No suspicious patterns or external calls.  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on managing commissions, settlements, and agent relationships. Uses standard ORM, computed fields, and validations. No external network activity or malicious code.  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Details management of commissions, settlements, and agents, with validation checks and record manipulations. All within expected patterns.  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Describes typical extension for accounting models, with no external calls or suspicious patterns. Validations prevent modification of settled lines, which is standard practice.  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no suspicious external calls, or data exfiltration.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports show obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Risk Score:** All are low, mostly around 0.1-0.2, consistent with standard business logic and ORM use.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no signs of malware)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, readable code)  \n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (minimal, mostly due to business logic validation, not security flaws)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate extension of Odoo's accounting and commission modules, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk scores across reports are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
