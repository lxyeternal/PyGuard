  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard extension of Odoo's accounting system for managing commissions and settlements. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's purpose and structure."
