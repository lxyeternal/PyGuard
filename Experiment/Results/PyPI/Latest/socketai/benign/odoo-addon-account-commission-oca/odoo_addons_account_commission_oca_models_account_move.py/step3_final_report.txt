{
  "purpose": "The code extends Odoo's accounting models to manage commissions, settlements, and agent relationships, primarily performing data computations, validations, and record manipulations within the ORM framework.",
  "sources": "Reads from ORM fields such as 'invoice_line_ids', 'partner_agent_ids', environment variables, and context; accesses related models and records.",
  "sinks": "Modifies settlement states, computes totals, creates or updates records, raises validation errors, and returns actions for UI views.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input fields and related models through computed methods to record updates; no external system calls or network activity are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward and adheres to standard ORM practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical extension of Odoo's accounting modules, utilizing standard ORM features, computed fields, validations, and record management. It manages settlement states, computes commissions, and enforces validation rules without external calls or malicious patterns. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The logic is business-oriented and aligns with standard practices, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard extension of Odoo's accounting system for managing commissions and settlements. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
