  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function within a Python package, but specific intent cannot be conclusively determined from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Data sources include input functions, environment variables, or external modules imported within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, subprocess executions, or data output functions that could expose data or affect the system.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing steps to sinks, possibly involving dynamic execution or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code features include any hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution functions (e.g., eval, exec), or obfuscated code segments. No obvious anomalies are observed in the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, including imports, input handling, data processing, and output functions. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or malicious functions were detected. Usage of third-party libraries is standard, and no obfuscation or hidden behaviors are evident. The code does not demonstrate insecure practices such as unsafe SQL or insecure environment variable handling. Without additional context or external dependencies, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. It seems to perform standard functions without suspicious intent or dangerous operations.",
