  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a basic script that imports certain libraries and performs some operations, but the exact intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input data is not explicitly read from external sources; the code imports modules and accesses environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or environment variable usage, but none are explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit source-to-sink data flows demonstrated in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments are apparent. The code structure appears straightforward and unremarkable.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and accesses environment variables, which is typical. No suspicious functions, code injections, or malicious patterns are evident. Absence of network activity, cryptic functions, or data exfiltration routines. The code's simplicity suggests no malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code appears benign and standard in nature.",
