  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that reports 1 and 4 contain significant malicious indicators, justifying high malware and risk scores. Other reports are benign. Slight score refinements improve accuracy. Overall, the dependency shows moderate to high risk in certain cases, warranting caution."
