  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "eval()/exec() calls, hardcoded credentials, environment variables, input functions, suspicious strings, data transmission points.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, system commands, file writes, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval()/exec() or input() leading to network transmission or system modification functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), hardcoded secrets, obfuscated variable names, unnecessary complexity, conditional logic designed to hide behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, and obfuscation in certain reports, indicating potential malicious intent. Reports 1 and 4 show concrete indicators like eval()/exec(), suspicious strings, and obfuscation, justifying high malware and security risk scores. Reports 2, 3, and 5 lack such indicators, aligning with benign assessments. Slight score adjustments are recommended: increase report 1's obfuscation to 0.3 and report 4's malware to 0.65 to better reflect the suspicion level. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, with high suspicion in reports 1 and 4, and benign nature in others.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that reports 1 and 4 contain significant malicious indicators, justifying high malware and risk scores. Other reports are benign. Slight score refinements improve accuracy. Overall, the dependency shows moderate to high risk in certain cases, warranting caution.",
