  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some data processing or functionality related to external libraries.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported libraries, environment variables, or input functions, if present. Specific sources are not identified in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writing, or printing output. Specific sink locations are not detailed in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., input or environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network or file output), passing through intermediate processing steps. Exact paths cannot be determined without detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected in the provided code. The code structure appears standard, with no suspicious constructs or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical Python script with imports and possibly some processing logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or malicious network activity. The absence of visible hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs suggests a low likelihood of malicious intent. Due to the lack of specific code content, this analysis is based on the typical structure and visible elements.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign with no suspicious activity detected. Confidence is moderate due to limited code visibility.",
