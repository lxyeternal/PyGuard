  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions. No explicit purpose indicating malicious intent is evident.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, file I/O, environment variables, or network requests if present. Specific source points are not visible due to lack of code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission functions, file write operations, system commands, or environment variable access. No suspicious sink points are clearly visible.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs) would be typical; without code, exact paths cannot be identified. No unusual data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are visible. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "Due to lack of provided code, the analysis is limited. The structure suggests standard programming practices without evident malicious or suspicious patterns. No security risks or malware behaviors are detected based on available information.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. Without additional context or code, confidence remains moderate.",
