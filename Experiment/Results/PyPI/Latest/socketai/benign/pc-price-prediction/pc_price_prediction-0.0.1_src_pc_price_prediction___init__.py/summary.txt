  "conclusion": "The assessments are consistent with the limited or benign nature of the provided code snippets. Given the absence of actual code, confidence levels are adjusted downward for reports 2, 3, and 4 to reflect the uncertainty. Malware and obfuscation scores remain at zero, as no malicious or obfuscated code is detected. Security risk scores are kept low, with slight adjustments to better match the lack of concrete evidence. Overall, the evaluations are justified and require no further modifications."
