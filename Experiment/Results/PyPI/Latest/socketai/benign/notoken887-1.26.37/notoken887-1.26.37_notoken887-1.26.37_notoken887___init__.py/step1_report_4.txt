  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility script, but without the actual code provided, the purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources could include environment variables, command line arguments, or external files if present, but none are visible in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution functions, none of which are identified without actual code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow can be identified due to lack of code content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified due to the absence of code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited by the absence of code content. As no code was provided, no analysis of sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies is possible. The overall security posture cannot be assessed without the code to review.",
  "conclusion": "There is no code provided for review. Therefore, no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation can be identified. The security risk is considered negligible in the absence of code.",
