  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to lack of comments or documentation, but it appears to be a Python script that interacts with external systems or data.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or network sources (if any are present in the code).",
  "sinks": "The code writes to output functions, files, or sends data over network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (such as user input or environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (such as output or network transmission).",
  "anomalies": "No clear anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution are identified in the provided code snippet. The code structure appears standard with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis reveals that the code reads input data, processes it using standard Python functions, and outputs results. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are evident. There are no network connections, reverse shells, or system modifications. The code lacks obfuscation, unusual language features, or hidden backdoors. It follows typical coding patterns without suspicious behavior. Without additional context or dynamic behavior, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a normal Python script with standard input/output operations, and no signs of malware or supply chain attacks are present.",
