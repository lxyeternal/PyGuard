{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings, possibly for obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings via the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, which take a string parameter.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data outputs are directly present. No network, file, or environment variable access is performed within this code.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed into 'encrypt' for transformation into a symbol-based cipher, and into 'decrypt' for reversing the process. No external data flow or untrusted source outside method parameters is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The substitution cipher appears extensive but benign. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The use of emoji and special characters for substitution could be intended for obfuscation but does not itself indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two methods for character substitution encryption and decryption, covering a broad range of characters including uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols. The replacements are consistent and reversible, with no evidence of code injection, network access, or environment manipulation. There are no external calls, no data leaks, or suspicious behaviors such as hidden data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The primary purpose appears to be simple obfuscation, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a basic reversible substitution cipher with no malicious behavior detected. It does not access external resources or perform harmful actions. Its purpose seems limited to obfuscating strings within a larger application. No security risks or malware signs are identified.",
