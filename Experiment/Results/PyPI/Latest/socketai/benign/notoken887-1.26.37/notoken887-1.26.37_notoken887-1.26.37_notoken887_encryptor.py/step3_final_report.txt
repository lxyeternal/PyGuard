  "purpose": "A reversible substitution cipher for string obfuscation and encoding.",
  "sources": "Input strings to be encrypted or decrypted within the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or sinks; all transformations are in-memory.",
  "flows": "Input string → substitution replacements in encrypt → reverse replacements in decrypt → output string.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive character replacements including emojis and symbols; unused imports ('requests', 'os', 'random', 'string') which may suggest incomplete code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward, symmetric substitution cipher for string obfuscation. No network requests, file operations, or system modifications are present. The large mapping of characters, including emojis and special symbols, indicates a high level of obfuscation but not malicious intent. The unused imports are benign but suggest possible incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The substitution is easily reversible, serving primarily for obscuring data rather than security. The overall structure is simple, with no external interactions or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, reversible substitution cipher primarily used for obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The high extent of character replacement justifies a high obfuscation score, but it does not indicate malicious intent. The unused imports are not suspicious but may reflect incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code.",
