{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings, possibly for obfuscation or lightweight encryption.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters in 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods; no external input reading or network data is directly involved.",
  "sinks": "The functions return transformed strings; there are no direct sinks involving untrusted data leading to system effects or data leaks within this code.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via character replacements in 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' functions; no data flows to external systems or files.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive character replacement mappings for obfuscation purposes. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious payloads are evident. No network activity, file operations, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple substitution cipher with predefined mappings for characters, serving to encode and decode strings by replacing characters with symbols and vice versa. It does not perform any network operations, file access, or system modifications. No input validation or security checks are present, but these are unnecessary given its functionality. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The functions are straightforward and serve only for string transformation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for string obfuscation with no malicious behavior, security risks, or malicious intent detected. It does not perform any harmful operations or contain vulnerabilities relevant to supply chain security beyond its simple cipher logic.",
