{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple token encryption and decryption mechanism using character replacements to obscure data.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read within this code; it only processes input provided to its functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or system commands within this code.",
  "flows": "The functions convert plaintext strings to encoded form and vice versa via character replacements; there are no untrusted data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, utilizing character replacement for obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. No use of environment variables, unsafe SQL, or insecure random number generation is present. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The TokenCryptor class performs simple substitution ciphers for encoding and decoding strings, replacing characters with symbols and then reversing the process. The approach is basic and does not involve external data or system interaction, minimizing security risks. The code does not contain hidden backdoors, network activity, or malicious behaviors. It appears designed solely for obfuscation or data transformation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a character-based cipher for encoding and decoding strings. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not interact with external systems or perform any harmful actions.",
