  "conclusion": "The setup.py code itself is safe and standard. The main concern is the suspicious contact information and URL, which could be used for malicious distribution but do not indicate malicious code within this snippet. The malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero; the risk score is modest (~0.2-0.4) reflecting metadata suspicion. Vigilance is advised when handling the actual package, but based solely on this code, it is benign."
