  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'notoken887' Python library, including metadata and entry points for command-line execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data, author information, description, URL, classifiers, Python version requirements, and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or potentially dangerous operations are visible.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from static metadata to package build instructions and console script entry point definitions; no untrusted data flow is detected.",
  "anomalies": "The author email 'hitler@gmail.com' is suspicious and potentially inappropriate but not malicious by code alone. The description and URL do not contain malicious indicators. No obfuscated or unusual code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It defines package metadata, includes a console script entry point, and requires Python >=3.6. The code contains no dynamic execution, untrusted input handling, or malicious constructs. The author email is suspicious but does not imply malicious intent within the code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. Overall, the code appears to be a typical setup script with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup.py configuration script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The suspicious author email is likely a red flag for inappropriate content but does not impact code security.",
