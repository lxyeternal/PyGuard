  "conclusion": "The code functions as an obfuscation and runtime execution tool that can be exploited for malicious purposes due to its pattern of encrypting, decrypting, and executing code dynamically. It does not contain explicit malware but facilitates obfuscation and hiding of malicious payloads. The security risk is high because of the potential for misuse, especially in supply chain contexts. The scores should reflect moderate malware suspicion (~0.35-0.4), high obfuscation (~0.7), and high security risk (~0.75)."
