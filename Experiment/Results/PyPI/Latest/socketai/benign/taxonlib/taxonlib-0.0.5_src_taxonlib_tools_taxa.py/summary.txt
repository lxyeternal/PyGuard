  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for taxonomy data processing with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor concern about debug print statements does not elevate the security risk significantly. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1). The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0)."
