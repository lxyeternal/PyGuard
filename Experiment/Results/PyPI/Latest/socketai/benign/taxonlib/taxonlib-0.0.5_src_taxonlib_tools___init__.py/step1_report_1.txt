{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be related to data processing or utility functions, but without further context, it is unclear. It does not have an explicit main function or obvious data output.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from standard input (e.g., via 'sys.stdin') or from function arguments if any are present, and potentially from environment variables or imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., via 'socket', 'requests'), file writes, or data leaks through printed output or logs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, possibly to output or external communication modules. Without explicit network code shown, the flow remains speculative.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure is straightforward. No suspicious dynamic execution or unusual language features are observed.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step, the code was reviewed for input sources such as environment variables, stdin, and module imports. Sinks like network or file I/O were examined. No suspicious data flows or anomalies such as hidden backdoors, malicious payloads, or malicious behaviors were found. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious unless combined with malicious patterns, which are not present here. Overall, the code seems benign based on the provided content.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. No malware behavior or obfuscation detected. The security risk level is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
