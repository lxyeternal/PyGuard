  "purpose": "Defines a data structure for managing file paths related to images, taxa, and output folders, likely used in a larger data processing or analysis pipeline.",
  "sources": "No input sources; all data comes from class attributes set elsewhere in the application.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs involving untrusted data are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations or outputs is evident in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass with attributes for directory paths and provides properties to generate specific file paths within an output folder. There are no input operations, network calls, or security-sensitive functions. The structure appears standard and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code flow.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, solely establishing a data structure for file path management without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
