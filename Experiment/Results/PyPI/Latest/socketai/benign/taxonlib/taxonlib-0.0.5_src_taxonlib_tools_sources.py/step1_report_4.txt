  "purpose": "Define a data structure for managing paths related to image processing and taxonomy data in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Attributes of the Source class: images_path, taxa_path, out_folder, identifier, namespace.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling, system calls, or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; properties generate paths from class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures detected. Usage of os.path.join is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass 'Source' with several string attributes related to file paths and identifiers. Two property methods generate file paths based on 'out_folder'. No input/output handling, network activity, or code execution occurs. The code appears to be a straightforward data container with path generation logic. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple data structure to organize file paths and identifiers for a larger process. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. The implementation is standard and safe.",
