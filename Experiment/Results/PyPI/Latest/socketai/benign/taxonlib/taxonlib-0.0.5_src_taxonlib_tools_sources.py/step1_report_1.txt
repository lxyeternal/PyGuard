  "purpose": "Define a data structure for handling file paths and identifiers related to images and taxa data.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data dynamically at runtime.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows from input to output or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code uses standard Python features with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass 'Source' with several string attributes for paths and identifiers. It includes two properties that generate file paths based on the 'out_folder' attribute. The code is straightforward, using standard Python features, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. There are no inputs or external data sources, and no data transmission or system modification occurs within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple data structure definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger system for managing file paths related to image and taxon data processing. There are no signs of malware or security threats in this fragment.",
