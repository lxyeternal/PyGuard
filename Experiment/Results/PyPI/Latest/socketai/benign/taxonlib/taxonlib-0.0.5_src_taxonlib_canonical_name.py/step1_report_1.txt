{
  "purpose": "The code aims to standardize and canonize taxonomic names by replacing variants, handling hybrids, subgenera, and group modifiers to facilitate consistent taxonomy parsing.",
  "sources": "Input: the 'taxon_name' string parameter in functions 'canonize', 'alternatives_match', and 'make_alternative'.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not write to files, network, or environment variables; it processes strings for standardization.",
  "flows": "Input 'taxon_name' -> 'canonize' function processes it -> standardization steps including replacement, splitting, handling special cases -> output of standardized name; 'alternatives_match' compares two names by processing with 'make_alternative' -> output of comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns such as dynamic execution, obfuscated code, network activity, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward text processing with hardcoded replacements and string manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of functions for taxonomic name normalization and comparison. It employs string replacement, splitting, and specific pattern handling to address various taxonomic notation variants. No external data sources, network operations, or insecure practices are present. The code's logic is focused on string manipulation for standardization purposes. It does not include any malicious payloads, backdoors, or malware indicators. It primarily performs data normalization, which is a benign operation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a harmless taxonomic name normalization script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs string processing to standardize taxonomic nomenclature without any external data access or harmful operations.",
