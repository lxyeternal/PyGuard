{
  "purpose": "The code normalizes taxonomic names by replacing variants, handling hybrids, subgenera, and group modifiers to standardize input strings.",
  "sources": "Input taxon_name string, which is processed through string replacements, tokenization, and pattern recognition.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs in-memory string manipulations without external data or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input string → tokenization and pattern handling → string replacements and normalization → output string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data access; straightforward string processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs pattern replacements for sensu lato/stricto forms, handles hyphens in group names, processes hybrids and their parentheses or '=' notation, and replaces modifiers with standardized tokens. It operates solely on string data with no external system calls or obfuscation. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The logic is clear, and the operations are typical for data normalization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for standardizing taxonomic names, with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score should be 0 for all reports. The high confidence score (around 0.9-1) is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.",
