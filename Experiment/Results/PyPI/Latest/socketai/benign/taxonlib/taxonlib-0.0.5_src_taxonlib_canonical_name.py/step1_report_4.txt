{
  "purpose": "This code appears to process and standardize taxonomic names, performing normalization, replacement, and comparison functions.",
  "sources": "Input: 'taxon_name' parameter in 'canonize', 'alternatives_match', and 'make_alternative' functions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks such as network communication, file writing, or sensitive data transmission are present.",
  "flows": "Input taxon_name is sanitized and normalized through multiple functions, then compared or transformed. No untrusted data is sent elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Replacement dictionaries and string operations are straightforward. The code does contain extensive string parsing and manipulation, but nothing inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs string replacements, tokenization, and normalization of taxonomic names, with functions to handle variations and synonyms. There are no network calls, file operations, or execution of untrusted data. The functions are purely computational, working on input strings. No suspicious patterns such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden backdoors are evident. The structure and logic are consistent with name normalization tasks. All operations are confined to in-memory processing. No external or malicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign taxonomic name normalization and comparison utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It processes input data locally without external communication or side effects.",
