{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process and standardize taxonomic names by removing or replacing certain modifiers, handling hybrid notation, and matching alternative forms.",
  "sources": "User input in function parameters 'taxon_name', and internal string operations on these inputs.",
  "sinks": "None of the operations involve writing to external systems, databases, or network communication. Data is processed and returned as strings.",
  "flows": "Input taxon names are processed through normalization functions, which replace alternative forms and handle special notation; no external data flow occurs outside the functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code performs string manipulations and standardizations, typical for data normalization tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically replaces alternative taxonomic notations with standardized forms, handles hybrid notation, and removes modifiers. It does not perform network access, file I/O, or external command execution. No obfuscation techniques, such as complex dynamic code evaluation, are present. The operations are straightforward string manipulations with clear purpose. No signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or backdoors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard string normalization utility for taxonomic names, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is purely for data processing and does not perform any harmful actions.",
