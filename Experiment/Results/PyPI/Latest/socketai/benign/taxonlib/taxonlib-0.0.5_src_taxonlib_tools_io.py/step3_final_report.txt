  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for interacting with the GBIF API, including data retrieval, caching, and logging setup.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from API endpoints, cache files, and environment variables for path and configuration management.",
  "sinks": "Writes JSON responses to cache files, logs messages to files and console, and outputs URLs and error messages to standard output.",
  "flows": "Fetches data from GBIF API endpoints; caches responses to local files; logs activity; handles errors and exceptions during requests.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without context managers for file operations, which could lead to resource leaks but not malicious activity; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API requests with proper error handling, caching, and logging. No suspicious network activity or code injection is present. The network requests are to legitimate GBIF endpoints with appropriate headers and timeouts. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. Minor resource management issues are present but do not impact security. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, legitimate, and free of malicious behavior or sabotage. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to minor resource handling practices, and the malware score is appropriately set to 0. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting code clarity. The overall security assessment is very low risk, suitable for supply chain deployment.",
