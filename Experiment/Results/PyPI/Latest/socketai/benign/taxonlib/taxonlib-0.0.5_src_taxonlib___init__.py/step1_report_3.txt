  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to implementing a functionality that involves reading input data, processing it, and possibly performing network operations or data handling.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions, environment variables, or external data files (if present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file write operations, or data transmissions to external servers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions and may reach sinks such as network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, malicious obfuscation, or backdoors detected. No suspicious dynamic code execution or misleading variables observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard Python constructs. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, unauthorized network activity, or hidden backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and does not appear suspicious. No embedded obfuscated code or unusual control flow detected. The overall structure and content do not suggest malicious intent or malware.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with standard implementation patterns. Confidence is high that this code is safe.",
