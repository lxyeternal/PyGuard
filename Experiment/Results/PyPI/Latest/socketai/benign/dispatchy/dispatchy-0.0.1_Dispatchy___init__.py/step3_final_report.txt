{
  "purpose": "Provides classes for sending notifications via Discord and Telegram webhooks, with input validation and request handling.",
  "sources": "User inputs such as URLs, tokens, chat IDs, message content, files, and embedded data.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to external API endpoints (Discord and Telegram).",
  "flows": "Input data flows from validation methods into payload construction, which then flows into network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. The print statement is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation on inputs, constructs JSON payloads, and sends HTTP requests to external APIs. Files are read from disk with existence checks. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The validation is basic but sufficient for typical use. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are observed. The overall structure is straightforward and aligns with legitimate webhook notification implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of webhook notification classes for Discord and Telegram. It performs necessary validation, handles files securely, and sends requests without malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
