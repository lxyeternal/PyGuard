  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard implementation of webhook notification classes for Discord and Telegram.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present.\n- The code performs input validation, constructs payloads, and sends HTTP requests to external APIs.\n- The print statement (\"Hi from Dispatchy :D\") is benign and unlikely to be malicious.\n- Files are read for upload but with existence checks; no suspicious file handling is evident.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence in code:** The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. The only minor point is the print statement, which is benign.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident. URL validation is basic but acceptable.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9, which aligns with the analysis. These seem reasonable.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **malware score** of 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious activity is detected.\n- The **obfuscated score** of 0 is appropriate; no obfuscation is present.\n- The **security risk score** of 0.2 is conservative, acknowledging potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but overall the code is safe.\n- The **request handling** and **validation** are standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- No issues found that warrant raising the malware or obfuscated scores.\n- The print statement is trivial; no reason to consider it suspicious.\n- The URL validation is minimal but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (reasonable given the potential for misuse with untrusted inputs, but no actual malicious activity)  \n\n**Confidence:** 0.9 (high, given the consistent analysis and absence of suspicious elements)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate, standard implementation of webhook notification classes for Discord and Telegram. It performs input validation, handles files appropriately, and sends requests to external APIs without any malicious or obfuscated behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the detailed analysis.",
