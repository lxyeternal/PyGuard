  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides classes for sending notifications via Discord and Telegram webhooks.\n- Performs input validation on URLs, tokens, chat IDs, message content, files, etc.\n- Constructs payloads and sends HTTP POST requests.\n- Reads files from disk for upload, with existence checks.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed.\n- The print statement at the start is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Notification classes for Discord and Telegram.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** User input flows into network requests.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscated or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard validation, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The low risk score reflects minimal security concern. The malware score is appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, straightforward validation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Standard validation, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate notification classes.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Validates inputs, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate notification code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, proper validation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard webhook messaging code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Set at 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern—appropriate given the code's functionality and validation.\n\n### **Final personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** (low, mainly due to potential misuse if inputs are untrusted, but this is typical for webhook utilities)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports' evaluations are consistent with the code. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the risk score is reasonable. No changes are necessary.\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-validated implementation of webhook notification classes with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and aligned with the code's characteristics.",
