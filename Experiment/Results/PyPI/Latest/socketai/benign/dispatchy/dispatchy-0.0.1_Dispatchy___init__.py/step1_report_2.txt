{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes to send messages via Discord and Telegram webhooks, primarily for notification purposes.",
  "sources": "User-provided webhook URLs, message contents, embed data, file paths, and Telegram tokens and chat IDs.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted URL validation, sending HTTP POST requests to Discord and Telegram API endpoints, reading files from disk.",
  "flows": "Input data (webhook URLs, message content, files, tokens) flows through validation, then is used to construct HTTP requests sent to external APIs.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward URL validation; no hardcoded secrets or credentials are evident. Files are read from disk without restrictions, but this is standard for upload functions. No evidence of obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of webhook message classes with input validation and error handling. It validates URLs, tokens, and IDs, and safely constructs payloads. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as system information exfiltration, reverse shells, or secret theft is detected. External requests are made directly to standard API endpoints without any obfuscation or malicious modifications. The code does not include any backdoors or hidden functions. Files are added only for upload and validated for existence. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident beyond the expected API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation for sending notifications via Discord and Telegram webhooks. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware indications are present. It performs standard validation and request handling, with no signs of data exfiltration or covert activities.",
