  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and whether the scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard implementation of webhook notification classes for Discord and Telegram.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The code performs basic validation, constructs payloads, and sends HTTP requests to external APIs.\n- The only minor note is the print statement (\"Hi from Dispatchy :D\"), which is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity of Issues\n\n- **Presence of Issues in Code:**  \n  The reports accurately describe the code's behavior. No issues such as code obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present.  \n  **Verdict:** No issues are present.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic:**  \n  The code's logic appears sound: validation, payload construction, request sending, error handling.  \n  **Verdict:** No logical flaws are evident.\n\n- **Scores Given (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk):**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk ≈ 0.2, confidence = 0.9.  \n  These seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points to Challenge or Confirm\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Since no malicious activity or backdoors are detected, malware = 0 is justified.  \n  **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  No obfuscation is present; code is straightforward.  \n  **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n- **Security Risk Score (~0.2):**  \n  The risk stems mainly from untrusted input being sent to external APIs, which is typical for webhook utilities. No additional risks are evident.  \n  **Scores are reasonable.**\n\n- **Print Statement (\"Hi from Dispatchy :D\"):**  \n  This is benign and unlikely to impact security.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that validation is basic but not malicious. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification\n\n- The code does not exhibit signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned reflect the benign nature of the code.\n- The potential security risk is minimal and typical for such utility classes.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n| Aspect            | Score (0 to 1) | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | **0**          | No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.                                |\n| Obfuscated        | **0**          | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                                                 |\n| Security Risk     | **0.2**        | Standard risk for untrusted input being sent to external APIs; no additional risks identified. |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code appears safe and intended for legitimate notification purposes. Proper validation is in place, and no malicious behavior is evident.",
