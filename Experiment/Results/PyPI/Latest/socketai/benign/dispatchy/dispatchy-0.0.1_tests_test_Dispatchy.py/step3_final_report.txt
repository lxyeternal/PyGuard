{
  "purpose": "Send a notification message containing a media URL to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded webhook URL and media URL within the script.",
  "sinks": "The webhook URL could be misused if leaked; the message content is sent via the Discord API.",
  "flows": "Webhook URL and message content are used as inputs; the message is sent through the DiscordWebhook.send() method to the specified webhook endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no user input handling, and no suspicious network activity. The webhook URL is hardcoded and publicly visible, which is a security concern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports a library, defines static URLs, creates a webhook object, sets message content, and sends it. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The only security concern is the exposure of the webhook URL, which could be misused if obtained by an attacker. Exception handling is appropriate, and the code performs a benign notification task. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: ~0.2-0.3) are consistent with this benign assessment. The overall conclusion is that the code is safe but with a minor security concern due to URL exposure.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple, benign notification sender with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security issue is the exposure of the webhook URL, which could be exploited if leaked. The malware score remains 0, and obfuscation is absent. The security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), justified by the URL exposure but not indicating malicious activity.",
