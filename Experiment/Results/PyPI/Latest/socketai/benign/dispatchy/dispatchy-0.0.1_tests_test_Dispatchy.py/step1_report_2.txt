  "purpose": "Send a message containing a video URL to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reading the webhook URL, the Catbox video URL, and the DiscordWebhook module import.",
  "sinks": "Sending the constructed message via DiscordWebhook.send() which makes an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Input URLs and data from variables → set_content() method → send() method which performs HTTP request.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded webhook URL and media URL; no input validation or dynamic user input; the webhook URL is exposed in code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a DiscordWebhook class and requests module. It defines a webhook URL and a media URL, then attempts to send a message with the media URL embedded. The webhook URL is hardcoded and publicly visible, which could lead to abuse or unauthorized use. The code does not perform any data sanitization or validation. The send() method triggers an HTTP POST request to Discord's API endpoint. No obfuscated code, malicious payload, or suspicious network activity is present. The code appears straightforward and intended solely for notification purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple notification sender with no embedded malicious code or malicious behavior. The main concern is the exposure of the webhook URL, which could be misused if compromised. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration behaviors.",
