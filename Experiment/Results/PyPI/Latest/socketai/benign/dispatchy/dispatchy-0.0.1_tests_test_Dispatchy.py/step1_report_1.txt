  "purpose": "Send a message containing a video URL to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "webhook_url, catbox_video_url",
  "sinks": "webhook.send() potentially sends data to Discord API",
  "flows": "webhook.set_content() prepares message → webhook.send() transmits data to Discord",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL and media URL, no user input validation, no obfuscation or hidden code",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines fixed URLs for webhook and media. It creates a DiscordWebhook object, sets its content with a message including the media URL, and sends it to Discord. Exception handling covers network issues and general errors. The URLs are hardcoded, which is common but can be a security concern if sensitive, but no credentials are embedded. The code performs a straightforward message sending function without malicious payloads or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple, benign implementation for posting a message with a link to a Discord webhook. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The hardcoded URLs are not inherently malicious but could be misused if used maliciously, yet within this context, they are harmless.",
