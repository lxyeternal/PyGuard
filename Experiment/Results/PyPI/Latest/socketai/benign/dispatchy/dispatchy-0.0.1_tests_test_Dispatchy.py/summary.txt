  "conclusion": "The script is a simple, benign notification sender with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security issue is the exposure of the webhook URL, which could be exploited if leaked. The malware score remains 0, and obfuscation is absent. The security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), justified by the URL exposure but not indicating malicious activity."
