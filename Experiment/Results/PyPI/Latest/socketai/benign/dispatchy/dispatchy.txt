It performs necessary validation, handles files securely, and sends requests without malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The script is a simple, benign notification sender with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security issue is the exposure of the webhook URL, which could be exploited if leaked. The malware score remains 0, and obfuscation is absent. The security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), justified by the URL exposure but not indicating malicious activity."
