  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'dispatchy' Python library, including reading the README.md for the long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; defining setup parameters; specifying install_requires dependencies",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no execution of untrusted code",
  "flows": "Reading file content as long_description, then passing setup parameters to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No obfuscated or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local README.md file and configures package metadata for distribution. The only external dependency is 'requests', which is a common library. No input validation, code execution, or untrusted data handling is present. No malicious patterns or malicious intent are evident. The code appears standard for a Python setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
