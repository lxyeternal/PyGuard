{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'dispatchy' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, package discovery via setuptools.find_packages(), hardcoded package metadata (name, version, author, etc.), and dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous actions; no network communication, code execution, or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading 'README.md' into 'long_description', then from static package metadata into the setup configuration; dependencies are specified but not dynamically fetched or executed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, obfuscated parts, or unusual behavior are present. The code appears to follow standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file for the long description and configures package metadata using setuptools. No user input, untrusted data, or dynamic code execution is involved. The dependencies are statically listed. There are no suspicious or malicious operations detected. All actions are typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any backdoors, data leaks, or malicious network activity.",
