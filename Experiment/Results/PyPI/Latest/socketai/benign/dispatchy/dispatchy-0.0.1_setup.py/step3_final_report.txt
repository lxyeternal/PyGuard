  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'dispatchy' Python library, configuring metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reading local file 'README.md' into 'long_description'; static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard setup code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using 'setuptools' to package a Python library. It reads a local README file, sets package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices indicate no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
