  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'dispatchy', used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, reading dependencies from 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks; no untrusted data execution points.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content flows into 'long_description'; dependencies are listed for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets observed. The code appears to be standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and reads a markdown file for the long description. It sets up package metadata, including name, version, author, URL, and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns are present. All used data are static or file-based, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears legitimate and safe for package distribution.",
