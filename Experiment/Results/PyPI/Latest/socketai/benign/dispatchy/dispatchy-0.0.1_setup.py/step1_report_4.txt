  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, retrieving package dependencies via 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' and loads dependencies into setup configuration; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python packaging setup using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no code injections, network operations, or security-sensitive operations present. The code follows common patterns for Python package setup and contains no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It appears safe and legitimate.",
