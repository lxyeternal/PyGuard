  "purpose": "A CLI script to load configuration and synchronize or revert dependencies using the 'paven' package.",
  "sources": "Reading the directory path, importing 'typer', and calling external functions 'load_configuration', 'revert_sync', 'run_sync'.",
  "sinks": "Delegated to external functions; no direct sinks within this code.",
  "flows": "Input directory -> load_configuration -> (if revert) revert_sync else run_sync.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward delegation, no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI wrapper that loads configuration and performs dependency sync or revert actions. It imports standard and third-party libraries, then calls external functions whose security depends on their implementation. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The structure is clear, and no suspicious logic is detected. External functions are assumed legitimate; the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign dependency management CLI tool with no malicious or suspicious behavior. External functions' security is outside this scope, but the code itself is safe.",
