{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to clean up vendored files in a specified directory, removing unnecessary files while protecting certain files from deletion.",
  "sources": "The code reads the destination directory via 'destination.iterdir()' to list files and directories. It also reads 'config.protected_files' and 'config.requirements' from the 'config' object.",
  "sinks": "The 'remove_all' function is called with the list of items to remove, potentially deleting files or directories. It uses 'protected' parameter to avoid deleting protected files.",
  "flows": "The code reads the directory contents ('sources'), filters items to remove based on name or directory status, then passes these items to 'remove_all' for deletion, with certain files protected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code. Use of type annotations and imports is standard. The 'remove_all' function's implementation is not shown, so its safety cannot be verified, but based on naming, it likely deletes files/directories.",
  "analysis": "The script performs directory listing and conditional filtering to determine which files to remove, avoiding protected files. The cleanup process appears straightforward and safe if 'remove_all' behaves as expected. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The code relies on external functions and configurations, but nothing suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a routine cleanup script for vendored files, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation for directory cleanup, assuming 'remove_all' functions correctly.",
