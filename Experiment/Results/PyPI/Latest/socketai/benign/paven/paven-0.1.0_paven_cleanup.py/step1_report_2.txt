{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to clean up existing vendored files in a specified directory, removing unnecessary or unwanted files while preserving certain protected files.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'destination' directory via 'destination.iterdir()' and the 'files_to_skip' list, as well as 'config.destination', 'config.protected_files', and 'config.requirements' from the Paven configuration object.",
  "sinks": "The 'remove_all' function is called with the list of items to remove, including potentially files or directories that are not protected, which could lead to deletion of important files if misconfigured.",
  "flows": "Source: Directory listing from 'destination.iterdir()' and input parameters; Sink: 'remove_all' function deleting files/directories; Flow: Directory contents -> filtering by 'determine_items_to_remove' -> 'remove_all' removes unprotected items.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The logic appears straightforward and safe for intended cleanup. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory iteration and filtering based on provided skip lists. It then calls a cleanup function to remove items not in the protected list. No external data is fetched or sent, and no suspicious system commands or network activity are present. The structure is clear, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cleanup utility intended for managing vendored files. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leakage mechanisms are identified. It performs expected file system operations in a safe manner.",
