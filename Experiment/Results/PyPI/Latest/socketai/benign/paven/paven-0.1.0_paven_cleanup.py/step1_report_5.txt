{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to clean up or remove vendored files from a specified directory, excluding certain protected files.",
  "sources": "The code reads the directory contents via `destination.iterdir()` and the `config.protected_files` list.",
  "sinks": "The `remove_all()` function is the main sink where file/directory removal occurs, potentially affecting filesystem integrity.",
  "flows": "Directory contents are enumerated; items not in the skip list are passed to `remove_all()` for deletion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to identify removable files and directories, avoiding protected files. It uses standard library functions and a utility `remove_all()`. There are no dynamic code executions, no suspicious file handling, and no external communications. The logic is straightforward and intended for cleanup tasks only.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard cleanup operation with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It simply removes unprotected files and directories, relying on the `remove_all()` utility. No malware or security risks are evident.",
