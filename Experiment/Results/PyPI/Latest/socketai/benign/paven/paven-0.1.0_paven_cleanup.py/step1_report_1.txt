{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to clean up and remove files and directories from a specified destination directory, except for protected files.",
  "sources": "The code reads the destination directory via 'destination.iterdir()' and the 'config.protected_files' list.",
  "sinks": "The 'remove_all' function is invoked with the list of items to be potentially removed, which could delete files or directories from the filesystem.",
  "flows": "Source: directory listing from 'destination.iterdir()' -> filtering based on 'files_to_skip' -> passing remaining items to 'remove_all' for deletion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior. The code simply performs file system cleanup based on predefined protected lists. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to identify files and directories to remove from a specified destination, excluding certain protected files. It uses standard library functions and a clear filtering process. The 'remove_all' function is called with items to delete, but without any indication that it performs malicious actions. The overall logic aligns with legitimate cleanup operations, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward cleanup utility intended to remove unprotected files from a directory, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility for maintaining a clean project directory.",
