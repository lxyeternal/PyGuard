{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for file and directory cleanup, including removing specific paths and regex-matched files/directories.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem via os.walk, Path.exists(), Path.is_dir(), Path.is_symlink(), Path.unlink(), and Path.relative_to().",
  "sinks": "Deletes files and directories using shutil.rmtree() and Path.unlink(), which can modify or remove filesystem data.",
  "flows": "Filesystem data is read to identify targets; matched files/directories are then deleted based on regex patterns.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious data leaks. No obfuscated or misleading code present. No network activity or external data sources involved.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem cleanup tasks: removing specified paths and matching files/directories via regex. No input from untrusted sources like network or user input other than filesystem scanning. Uses common Python modules for file operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized access. Functions are straightforward and serve utility purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be safe, standard utility functions for cleaning files/directories based on path lists and regex patterns. No malicious intent detected, and no suspicious activities are evident.",
