  "purpose": "Utility functions for cleaning up files and directories, including removing all specified items and removing items matching a regex pattern within a directory.",
  "sources": "Input paths to functions 'remove_all' and 'remove_matching_regex', particularly user-provided directory paths and pattern strings.",
  "sinks": "File and directory deletion functions: 'shutil.rmtree' and 'Path.unlink', which delete files and directories based on the input and pattern matching.",
  "flows": "Input paths and pattern strings are used to identify files/directories to delete. 'remove_matching_regex' matches regex patterns against directory and file names to determine deletions. 'remove_all' deletes specified paths, respecting protections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of regex for pattern matching and deletion is standard for cleanup scripts. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides safe utility functions for deleting files and directories based on given inputs. It carefully avoids deleting protected or non-existent items. Use of regex for matching filenames or directory names is typical for cleanup purposes. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident. The functions depend on user-supplied paths and patterns, which should be validated externally but are not inherently malicious. The code appears well-structured and safe for intended cleanup operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward cleanup utility code with no signs of malicious behavior. It handles file system deletions based on specified criteria without executing any untrusted code or performing malicious actions. No malware or security risks are detected.",
