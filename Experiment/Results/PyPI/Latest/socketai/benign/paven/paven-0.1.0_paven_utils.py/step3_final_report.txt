  "purpose": "Filesystem cleanup utilities for removing specified paths and regex-matched files/directories.",
  "sources": "Paths provided to remove_all and remove_matching_regex functions, including the path parameter in remove_matching_regex.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted input paths and regex patterns used for deletion, potentially leading to unintended file removal if misused.",
  "flows": "Paths and regex patterns serve as sources; matching files/directories are deleted as sinks; flow occurs during os.walk and regex matching.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard libraries and patterns; no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward filesystem deletions with protections for certain paths and symlinks. It compiles regex patterns for matching filenames and directory names during traversal. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved. The functions are typical for cleanup utilities, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of regex for matching files/directories is standard but could be misused if patterns are user-controlled, which is a common risk in such scripts. Overall, the code is safe, clear, and predictable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign filesystem cleanup utility with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the operational nature of the functions. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
