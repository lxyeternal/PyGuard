  "purpose": "Utility functions for file and directory cleanup operations, including removal based on conditions and regex matching.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem using os.walk, Path.exists(), Path.is_dir(), Path.is_symlink(), Path.unlink(), shutil.rmtree(), and re.compile().",
  "sinks": "Deletes files with Path.unlink() and directories with shutil.rmtree(), potentially removing files or directories based on regex matches.",
  "flows": "Filesystem scanning via os.walk() and Path operations, with matching conditions leading to deletion of files/directories.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs deletion based on regex matches without validation of the pattern or safety checks, but this is typical for cleanup utilities and not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code evident. No network or system commands are invoked.",
  "analysis": "The functions are designed for cleanup tasks. remove_all() deletes files/directories unless they are protected or do not exist. remove_matching_regex() deletes files/directories matching a regex pattern. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are evident beyond filesystem data. The use of regex for deletion is standard for cleanup scripts. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard filesystem cleanup operations with regex-based deletions. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior, and the functions appear to serve legitimate utility purposes.",
