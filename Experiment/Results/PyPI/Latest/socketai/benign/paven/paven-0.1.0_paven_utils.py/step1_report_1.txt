  "purpose": "Utility functions for removing files and directories based on specific criteria, including regex matching.",
  "sources": "Input paths provided to remove_matching_regex, and the items_to_cleanup parameter in remove_all.",
  "sinks": "File deletion operations such as shutil.rmtree() and Path.unlink().",
  "flows": "Input paths are traversed and matched against regex patterns; matching files/directories are then deleted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior or hidden mechanisms detected; the code performs straightforward file removal tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions to remove files and directories. remove_all safely skips protected paths and non-existing items, avoiding deletion of protected files/directories. remove_matching_regex compiles a regex pattern and deletes all files and directories matching this pattern in the specified path, using os.walk for traversal. Both functions use standard library functions for file system manipulation with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The functions rely on predictable and safe operations, with no dynamic code execution or external data sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing safe cleanup operations on the filesystem based on user-provided paths and regex patterns. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. It is a benign utility code with no security risks evident.",
