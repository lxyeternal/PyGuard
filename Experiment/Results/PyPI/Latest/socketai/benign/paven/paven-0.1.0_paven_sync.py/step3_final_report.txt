No external inputs or network activity are involved. The use of 'reverse=True' in rewrite_imports is typical for reverting import modifications. No obfuscation or malicious logic is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 or 0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The low risk score reflects minimal operational risk, primarily related to filesystem modifications, which are standard for such utilities. No evidence suggests malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\\n\\nconclusion\": \"The code is a benign dependency management utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. The assessments and scores are justified and accurate.\",\n  \"confidence\": 1,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
