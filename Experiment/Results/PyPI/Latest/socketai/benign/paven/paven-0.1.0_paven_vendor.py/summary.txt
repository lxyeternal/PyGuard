  "conclusion": "The code is a typical dependency vendoring utility with moderate security considerations. It does not exhibit malicious intent or malware but relies on untrusted external inputs (patches, dependencies). Proper validation and integrity checks are recommended to mitigate supply chain risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3)."
