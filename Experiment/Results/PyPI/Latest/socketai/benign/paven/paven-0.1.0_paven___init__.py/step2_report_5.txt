  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a minimal Python module with only a docstring, a version string, and an import statement for `__future__.annotations`. There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or executable logic. Therefore, **no issues or vulnerabilities are present**.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports consistently identify the code as benign, minimal, and standard for package setup or documentation purposes. They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in these assessments.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0  \n   - `obfuscated`: 0  \n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   - `confidence`: 1  \n\n   These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code shows no malicious intent, no data leaks, and no security concerns, the overall risk score should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports, aligning with the code's harmless nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as boilerplate or setup code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\nThe code is purely boilerplate, with no functional or malicious components. The assessments are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**In conclusion, I agree with the reports' evaluations. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.**",
