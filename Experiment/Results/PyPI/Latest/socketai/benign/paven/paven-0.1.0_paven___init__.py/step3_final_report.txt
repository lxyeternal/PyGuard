  "purpose": "Minimal boilerplate or metadata for a Python package, possibly related to vendoring dependencies.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from __future__ import annotations', the version string '__version__', and the module docstring.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or outputs; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not process or handle data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of functions, data handling, or dynamic code; only static import and version info; no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static module containing only a docstring, a version string, and an import statement for __future__. It does not perform any operations, handle data, or interact with external systems. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as minimal package metadata or setup code. There are no indicators of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and do not require modification.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
