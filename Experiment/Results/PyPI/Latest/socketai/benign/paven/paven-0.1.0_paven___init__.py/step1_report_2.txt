{
  "purpose": "The code appears to serve as a minimal or partial vendor for Python packages, possibly to include dependencies directly within a project.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or data; it contains only an import statement and a version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs; the code simply sets a version variable.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, containing only a version declaration and an import statement for future annotations. No malicious or unusual behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __future__.annotations feature, which enables postponed evaluation of annotations for compatibility reasons, and defines a version string. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution. The code does not interact with external inputs, files, or network resources. It appears to be boilerplate or preparatory code for a Python package or module, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is simple and standard for setting up a Python package.",
