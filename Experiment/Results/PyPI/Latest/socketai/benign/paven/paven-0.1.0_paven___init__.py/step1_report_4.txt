  "purpose": "The code appears to be a minimal header or stub for a Python package, possibly related to vendoring dependencies.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements and a version string, with no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a future import for annotations and a version string declaration. There are no functions, external data reads, or other executable code. This minimal code fragment does not perform any data processing, network communication, or potentially malicious actions. Its purpose seems to be documentation or setup for a larger module.",
  "conclusion": "This code shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign, standard initial snippet for a Python project.",
