  "purpose": "Partial vendoring for Python packages, likely for dependency management or distribution purposes.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs, external calls, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of unusual or malicious behavior. The only notable features are the version string and the future import statement, both standard in Python projects.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a module docstring, a version string, and an import statement from __future__, which is used to ensure compatibility across Python versions. There are no functions, data processing, external calls, or suspicious constructs. The minimal and standard nature of this code indicates no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a small part of a vendoring or packaging setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
