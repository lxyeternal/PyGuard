  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is purely a minimal module with a docstring, a version string, and an import from `__future__`. There are no functions, data handling, external inputs, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n   - The code is benign and appears to serve as metadata or a boilerplate for a package.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis. They correctly identify the code as benign, minimal, and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The conclusion in each report aligns with the code content.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which is justified.\n   - No reason to elevate the risk score since there's no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's content and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nGiven the minimal, benign nature of the code, the scores are appropriate. The code is essentially a stub or metadata file, with no functional or security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are justified and should remain as-is.",
