  "purpose": "Partial vendoring for Python packages",
  "sources": "Import statements and version declaration",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "None present; code does not process data or execute input-dependent logic",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code only contains import and version declaration with no additional logic",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal snippet that imports a future feature and declares a version string. There are no data input points, no external data processing, and no dynamic code execution. The absence of functional code or data handling suggests a benign purpose, likely as part of a larger package initialization or vendoring process. No signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, minimal setup fragment for a Python package. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It simply indicates the package version and a future import for compatibility.",
