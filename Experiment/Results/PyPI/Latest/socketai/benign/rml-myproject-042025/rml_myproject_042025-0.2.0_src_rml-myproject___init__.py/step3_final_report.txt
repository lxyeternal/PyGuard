  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, environment variables, input/output functions, network calls, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, data processing functions.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) to sinks (e.g., network, file system).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code appears benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or benign code with no malicious payloads or suspicious activity. Malware scores are consistently zero, obfuscation levels are low or none, and security risks are low (0.2). Confidence levels are high (0.7-0.8). The assessments align with the descriptions, and no evidence suggests malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and conservative, reflecting the benign nature of the code snippets analyzed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The current scoring accurately reflects the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
  "malware": 0,
