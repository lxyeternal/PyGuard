  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard compatibility module, performing version detection, optional dependency imports, and setting up environment-specific variables.\n- All reports agree that the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute malicious code.\n- The only dynamic behaviors involve optional imports and version checks, which are common in such utility modules.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as handling compatibility and utility functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or dangerous flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; standard import handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear and justified. Malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the dynamic import of optional modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code; standard practice.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded. Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; emphasizes version info and optional dependencies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior; standard compatibility code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate. Malware score is 0.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the import handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or malicious flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified. Malware score is 0.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Properly notes the compatibility focus.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious or risky operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid. Malware score is 0.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard compatibility utility module.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 or 0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- The slightly non-zero securityRisk scores (e.g., 0.1) are acceptable given the dynamic imports, but they are not indicative of actual risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0.1 or 0 is appropriate; perhaps 0.05 to reflect minimal concern over dynamic imports, but overall very low.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                   | No malicious code or behaviors detected                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                   | Clear, straightforward code without obfuscation            |\n| Security Risk    | 0.05 - 0.1         | Minor concern over dynamic imports, but standard practice  |\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The existing scores are reasonable; I would recommend keeping malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (e.g., 0.05).\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-step conclusion:**  \n- Confirmed no malicious code or obfuscation.  \n- Scores are appropriate.  \n- The code is a typical, well-understood compatibility module with no security issues.\n\n**Final verdict:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No changes necessary.",
