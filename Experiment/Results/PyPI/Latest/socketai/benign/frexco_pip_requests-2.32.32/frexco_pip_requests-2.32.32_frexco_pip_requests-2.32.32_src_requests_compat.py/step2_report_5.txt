  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code handles compatibility, version detection, and safe imports.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external communication.  \n- **Anomalies:** Standard dynamic imports, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical compatibility module with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — appropriate given the benign nature but acknowledging minimal risk due to dynamic imports.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe imports, version checks, and optional dependencies.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — aligns with the benign, standard utility purpose.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Focuses on compatibility, optional dependencies, and version handling.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — consistent with benign utility code.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Describes compatibility, imports, and optional third-party libraries.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Similar analysis: compatibility, safe imports, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — fitting for standard utility code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns or suspicious constructs are present.  \n- **Risk Score:** The original minimal risk score (~0.1) is reasonable; the code is standard, with only dynamic imports which are common in compatibility modules.\n\n### Additional Observations:\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute code from unverified sources.  \n- Dynamic imports are standard for optional dependencies and do not indicate malicious intent.  \n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (benign, standard compatibility code)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, readable code)  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, mainly due to dynamic imports, but not risky)  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses provided and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured compatibility utility module with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
