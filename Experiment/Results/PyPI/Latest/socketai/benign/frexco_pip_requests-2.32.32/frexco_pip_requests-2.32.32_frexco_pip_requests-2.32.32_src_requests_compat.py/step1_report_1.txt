{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling character detection, version differences, and imports in Python 2 and 3, primarily for backwards compatibility and library interoperability.",
  "sources": "The code reads version info from 'sys', imports modules such as 'importlib', 'urllib3', 'json' or 'simplejson', 'collections', 'http.cookiejar', 'http.cookies', 'io.StringIO', and several functions from 'urllib.parse' and 'urllib.request'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only performs safe import and version detection without processing external input or executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, checking versions, and assigning variables based on imports or conditions. There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks or dangerous functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes dynamic imports and version checks, but these are standard compatibility measures. No suspicious or malicious anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs import handling, version detection, and compatibility setups. It uses try-except blocks for safe imports, dynamically detects available libraries, and assigns variables for compatibility. No code executes untrusted data, nor are there operations that could lead to malicious effects. All imports are standard libraries or well-known dependencies, and there is no network or file manipulation beyond imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical compatibility and utility module without malicious intent. It does not perform any risky operations, and the usage of imports and version checks appears benign and standard for maintaining cross-version compatibility.",
