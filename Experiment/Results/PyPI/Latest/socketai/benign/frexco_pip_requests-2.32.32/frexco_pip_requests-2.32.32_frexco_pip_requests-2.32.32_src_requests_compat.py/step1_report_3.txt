{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility and utility functions for handling Python 2 and 3 differences, as well as importing dependencies such as urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, and standard library modules.",
  "sources": "import statements, importlib.import_module calls, sys.version_info, version string parsing",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external network interactions are present",
  "flows": "N/A — no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs or sensitive data",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. The code only performs standard compatibility and import resolution tasks. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code handles compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3, resolves optional dependencies like simplejson, and imports standard modules. It includes version checks and dynamic import attempts, but all operations are standard and benign. No malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors, are evident. The code is primarily utility functions with straightforward logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign compatibility utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard imports and environment checks without any suspicious patterns or behaviors.",
