{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility utilities for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as managing imports for various libraries such as urllib3, chardet, simplejson, and standard library modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external libraries (urllib3, chardet, simplejson), and internal functions like _resolve_char_detection() which dynamically imports optional libraries.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; no network or data output code. The code mainly performs imports and version checks.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules and setting up compatibility variables, with no data transformations or user input processing occurring.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports optional modules (chardet, simplejson) without validation of their contents or integrity, but this is standard practice for optional dependencies. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are found.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages imports and compatibility across Python versions. It uses try-except blocks to handle missing modules, which is common and not suspicious. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are evident. The dynamic import of libraries like chardet and simplejson is standard for optional dependencies and does not pose security risks by itself. The code does not perform network communication, file access beyond imports, or system modifications. The overall structure indicates a compatibility module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard compatibility utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs dynamic imports and sets up environment-specific variables in a typical manner for such utilities.",
