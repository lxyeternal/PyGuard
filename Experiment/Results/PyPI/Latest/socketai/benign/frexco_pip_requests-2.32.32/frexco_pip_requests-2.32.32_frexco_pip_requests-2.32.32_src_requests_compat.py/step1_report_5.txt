{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility support for different Python versions and imports required modules for HTTP requests, encoding, and character detection.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (importlib, sys, collections, http, io, urllib), and dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No network or file output or command execution is present.",
  "flows": "The code detects library versions and conditionally imports modules, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The dynamic import of character detection libraries is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on compatibility across Python versions and import resolution. It conditionally imports modules based on availability and Python version, which is typical for maintaining backward compatibility. No external data is read at runtime beyond standard library imports. No malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is present. The dynamic import of character detection libraries (chardet/charset_normalizer) is for functionality enhancement, not malicious activity. Overall, the code is well-structured and standard for compatibility support, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard compatibility and import management code with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malicious or malicious-looking constructs and appears to be a benign part of a larger package.",
