{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support for different Python versions and external libraries such as urllib3, chardet, and simplejson, facilitating consistent behavior across environments.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (importlib, sys, collections, http, io, urllib) and optional third-party libraries (chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson).",
  "sinks": "Uses imported modules to process data; no direct sinks like system calls or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Standard import flow for compatibility and utility functions; no untrusted data sources or flow from untrusted input to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; the code mainly handles compatibility and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version detection, dynamic import of optional libraries (chardet, simplejson), and defines compatibility functions and types. It does not execute untrusted input or contain dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or malicious logic. The import mechanisms are standard and do not exhibit malicious intent. The only noteworthy aspect is the optional import of third-party libraries, which is a common pattern and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility module used in many Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It primarily facilitates backward compatibility and optional feature support.",
