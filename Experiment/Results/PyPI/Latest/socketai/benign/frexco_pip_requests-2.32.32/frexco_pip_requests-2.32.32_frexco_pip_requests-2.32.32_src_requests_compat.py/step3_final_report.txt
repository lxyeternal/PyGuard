  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for handling Python version differences, optional dependencies, and environment setup.",
  "sources": "Version info from sys.version_info, optional modules ('chardet', 'simplejson'), standard library imports.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Version detection and conditional imports flow into environment setup variables; no external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import patterns, version checks, and optional dependency handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version detection, optional imports, and environment setup in a straightforward manner. It does not process untrusted data, execute network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The dynamic imports are typical for compatibility modules and do not pose security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility module with no malicious intent or security issues. The existing scores are justified and appropriate.",
