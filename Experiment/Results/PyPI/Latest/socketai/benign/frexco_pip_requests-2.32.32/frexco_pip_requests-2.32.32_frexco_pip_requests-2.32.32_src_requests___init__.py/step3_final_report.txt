  "purpose": "This code manages dependency version checks, environment configuration, and warning settings for the 'requests' library, ensuring compatibility and proper setup.",
  "sources": "Version variables (__version__, chardet_version, charset_normalizer_version), imported modules (urllib3, ssl, cryptography), and assertion statements for dependency validation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code performs environment setup and validation without handling user input or network data.",
  "flows": "Dependency version variables are checked and validated via assertions; warnings are issued if dependencies are incompatible; environment configuration is adjusted based on SSL support.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for dependency validation could be bypassed if Python is run with assertions disabled, but this is standard practice and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup routine for the 'requests' library, performing dependency checks, environment configuration, and warning management. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The assertions are typical but could be bypassed; however, this does not introduce security risks. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden payloads. Dependency version checks and SSL fallback mechanisms are standard for ensuring compatibility across environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing routine dependency validation and environment setup without any malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
