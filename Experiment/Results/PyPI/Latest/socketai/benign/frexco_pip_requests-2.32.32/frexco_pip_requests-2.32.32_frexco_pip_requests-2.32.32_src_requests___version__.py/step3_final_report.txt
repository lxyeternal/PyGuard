  "purpose": "Static package metadata declaration including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and decorative comments.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments defining package information; no external input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; static assignments without data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of decorative Unicode characters in comments; no malicious or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no functions, input/output, external calls, or dynamic code. The ASCII art comments are purely decorative. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, static, and metadata-only. The assigned scores—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0—are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. Confidence scores are high (1), reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata file with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
