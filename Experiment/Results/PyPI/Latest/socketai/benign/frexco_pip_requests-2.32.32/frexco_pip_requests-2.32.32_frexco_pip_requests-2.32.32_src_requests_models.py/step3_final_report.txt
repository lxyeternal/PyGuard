{
  "purpose": "The code implements a standard HTTP request and response handling library, managing URL parsing, headers, cookies, encoding, and JSON serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as method, url, headers, data, json, params, cookies, auth, files, and hooks; request data streams; response raw data.",
  "sinks": "Request body transmission, response content consumption, headers, cookies, and potential data leaks if untrusted data is mishandled.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request construction, encoding, and transmission; response data flows into parsing, decoding, and content access.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity detected. Uses well-known libraries and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of an HTTP client library, handling URL parsing, encoding, headers, cookies, JSON, and response processing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The logic aligns with standard practices, and the security implications are minimal. The code relies on trusted libraries and does not include any suspicious network activity or secret exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard HTTP request/response handling module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is very low, and the malware score is justified as 0. The obfuscation score is 0, and the overall risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting typical request handling complexity. The assessments are consistent and justified.",
