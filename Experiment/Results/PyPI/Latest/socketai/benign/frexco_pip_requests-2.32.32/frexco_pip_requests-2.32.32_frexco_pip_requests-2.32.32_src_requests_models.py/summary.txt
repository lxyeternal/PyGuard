  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard HTTP request/response handling module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is very low, and the malware score is justified as 0. The obfuscation score is 0, and the overall risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting typical request handling complexity. The assessments are consistent and justified."
