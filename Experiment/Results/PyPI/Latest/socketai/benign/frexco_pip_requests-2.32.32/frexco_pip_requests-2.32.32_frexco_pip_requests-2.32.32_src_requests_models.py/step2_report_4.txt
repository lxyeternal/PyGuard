  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of malicious behavior, the appropriateness of the scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard request/response handling, URL parsing, headers, cookies, JSON, auth.\n- **Sinks:** Request body, headers, cookies, response content.\n- **Flow:** Typical data flow from input parameters into request objects and responses.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured implementation with no signs of malicious activity. It relies on standard libraries and patterns, with no obfuscated or malicious code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, consistent with standard code)  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, with standard input sources.\n- **Sinks:** Request transmission, response handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code, just standard handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard implementation, no malicious behaviors or sabotage signals.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, typical for such code)\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard request/response with URL parsing, headers, cookies.\n- **Sinks:** Network transmission, response content.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, legitimate code, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, typical for such code)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with focus on request construction.\n- **Sinks:** Request transmission, response handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard implementation, no malicious signals.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, typical for such code)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard request/response handling.\n- **Sinks:** Request and response data.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical, secure implementation, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity; setting malware score at **0** is justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; **0** is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the complexity and potential for misuse, but based on the analysis, the overall security risk remains very low. Scores of **0.1–0.2** are reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- No signs of backdoors, secret exfiltration, or malicious code.\n- The code relies on standard, well-known libraries and patterns.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution.\n- The request and response handling is typical for an HTTP client library.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1–0.2 |\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate given the code and reports. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, secure implementation of an HTTP client library component, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores reflect a low security risk, which is justified.",
