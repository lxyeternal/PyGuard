  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring score consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes standard request/response handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with typical HTTP client behavior; no malicious activity identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, considering normal request handling).\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment appears reasonable and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly identifies standard data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code; standard encoding and decoding.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; code is typical for an HTTP client.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard request/response management.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or backdoors; relies on well-known libraries.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; code appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Proper request/response handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of sabotage or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard data flow description.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code or backdoors; uses safe patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting the inherent risk in handling untrusted data, but nothing alarming.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Low, consistent with typical request handling code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's analysis. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, secure implementation of an HTTP client module, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The provided assessments are justified and align with the code's behavior.",
