  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code to determine if the scores and conclusions are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No suspicious or malicious code; standard request/response handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies no malicious or obfuscated code. The low malware and security risk scores are justified given the code's nature. The conclusion aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores and conclusion are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard HTTP handling, no signs of malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no backdoors.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are apparent. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores and conclusion are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard request/response handling, no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The code is typical for an HTTP client library. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores and conclusion are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard HTTP request/response management, no malicious activity, no backdoors, no unsafe code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's functionality. The low scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores and conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard handling, no signs of malicious behavior, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears standard and secure. The scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores and conclusion are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the code's nature. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but all low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the code's standard, well-understood functionality.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical implementation of an HTTP client library component, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- The scores are aligned with the detailed analysis and the code's content.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9) are justified given the thorough review.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, as the code is part of a well-known library and handles data securely.\n\n**Summary:** The current scores and conclusions across all reports are appropriate and justified based on the code review.",
