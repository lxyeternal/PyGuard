  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies with the requests library, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion functions, facilitating cookie handling in HTTP requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include request objects (`request`) for extracting cookies, response objects (`response`) for cookie extraction, and dictionaries for creating or merging cookies.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve the functions that set, update, or delete cookies (`set`, `set_cookie`, `remove_cookie_by_name`, `update`, `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`), and the creation of cookies (`create_cookie`, `morsel_to_cookie`). These can modify cookie storage, but do not directly impact system security or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (requests, response headers, dictionaries) into cookie objects through parsing or creation functions, then into cookie jars where they can be stored, updated, or removed. No external or untrusted data is sent over the network or used maliciously within these flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes standard cookie management utilities, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated logic, or backdoors. There is a comprehensive handling of cookies, but no unusual or suspicious patterns are evident. All functions perform expected cookie operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily utility functions and class implementations for managing cookies within the requests library ecosystem. It wraps standard Python modules (`http.cookiejar`, `urllib.parse`) and provides interface compatibility. The functions handle cookie extraction, header formation, creation, deletion, and merging, all in a typical manner for cookie handling. There are no network connections, data exfiltration, or system modification activities. No indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The use of threading locks is standard for thread safety. Overall, the code performs expected cookie management without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for cookie handling in requests. It exhibits normal behavior aligned with its purpose, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The code is well-structured and does not contain obfuscation or hidden malicious logic.",
