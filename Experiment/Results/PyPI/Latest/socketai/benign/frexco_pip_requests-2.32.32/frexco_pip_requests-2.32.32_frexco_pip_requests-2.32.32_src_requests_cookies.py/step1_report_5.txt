  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities and a CookieJar implementation for handling cookies in requests, including extracting, managing, and merging cookies.",
  "sources": "Reading request headers, response headers, and cookie attributes; accessing environment variables and cookies; creating and modifying cookie objects.",
  "sinks": "Adding headers to requests; setting and removing cookies in the CookieJar; serializing cookies via pickling.",
  "flows": "Extract cookies from response headers into the jar; generate cookie headers for requests; modify cookies based on input parameters; merge cookies into existing jar.",
  "anomalies": "Use of private/internal attributes (e.g., _original_response, _headers); no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or malicious dynamic execution observed; no suspicious network connections or file modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of cookie management and compatibility utilities for the requests library. It includes methods for extracting cookies, creating, setting, deleting, and merging cookies, with no signs of hidden backdoors or malicious behaviors. No malicious code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity is present. The code relies on standard Python modules and structures, with no unusual or obfuscated patterns. The functions operate in a controlled manner, mainly managing cookies and request headers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of cookie handling for the requests library, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It provides necessary utilities for cookie management without any indications of malware or security risks.",
