{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exceptions and warnings for the requests library to handle various HTTP errors, connection issues, and related warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and .compat; attribute checks like hasattr(response, 'request')",
  "sinks": "Exception initializations and attribute assignments, potentially passing untrusted data to exception constructors",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (*args, **kwargs) through exception constructors to class attributes; response and request objects are assigned from kwargs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present; code primarily handles exception structuring and inheritance",
  "analysis": "The code defines a structured exception hierarchy for HTTP and connection errors in the requests library, including handling JSON decode errors and warning classes. It imports external exceptions, checks attributes like 'response.request', and initializes exceptions with provided arguments. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. The code is straightforward and standard for error handling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for the requests library with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It appears to be purely for structured error handling and warnings, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
