  "purpose": "This module defines custom exceptions and warnings for the Requests library, mainly for handling various HTTP errors and related issues.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and internal compatibility module for JSONDecodeError.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform data transmission.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The class hierarchy and exception definitions are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for exception handling within the Requests library, with proper inheritance and standard docstrings. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or network activity is present. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors identified. All imported modules and dependencies are typical for error handling in HTTP client libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception and warning class definitions for error handling in Requests. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It appears safe and benign.",
