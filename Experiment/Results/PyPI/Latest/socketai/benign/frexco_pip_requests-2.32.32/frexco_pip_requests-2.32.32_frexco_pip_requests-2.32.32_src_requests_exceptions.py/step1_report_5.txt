{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for the Requests library to handle various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from imported modules (urllib3.exceptions, .compat), and defines classes that may be instantiated during request handling.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present; exception classes are for internal error handling.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised during request processing; no data flows from source to sink within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; code primarily consists of class definitions and straightforward inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of exception classes for the requests library, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted input. It imports external exceptions and defines subclasses for various error conditions. The class constructors mainly initialize exception objects with optional request/response data. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. The code structure is standard for defining exception hierarchies, and there is no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical exception hierarchy for the Requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or malicious sabotage. It does not perform any network operations or data handling that could be exploited. The risk is minimal.",
