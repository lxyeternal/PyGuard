  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by aliasing modules ('urllib3', 'idna', and optionally 'chardet') under the 'requests.packages' namespace to ensure legacy code compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet'; references to these modules in sys.modules during aliasing.",
  "sinks": "sys.modules modifications that reassign module references under 'requests.packages' namespace.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are assigned to local variables; sys.modules entries are updated to alias these modules under 'requests.packages' namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional manipulation of sys.modules for namespace aliasing; no external data input or network activity; straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and remaps their references within sys.modules to maintain compatibility with older code expecting modules under requests.packages. This pattern is known and used for compatibility, not malicious. No external inputs, network activity, or data leaks are present. The sys.modules manipulation, while unusual, is a standard pattern for compatibility patches. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is clear and straightforward, with no obfuscation. The main concern is environmental: if sys.modules is compromised, malicious modules could be masked, but this is outside the code's scope. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim that manipulates sys.modules to alias modules under requests.packages. It does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
