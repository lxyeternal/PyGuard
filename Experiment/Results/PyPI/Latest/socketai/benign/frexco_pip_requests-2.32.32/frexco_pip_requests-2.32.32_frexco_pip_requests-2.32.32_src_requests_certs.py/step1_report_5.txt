{
  "purpose": "To provide the default CA bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from certifi import where' which reads the certifi package to obtain the CA bundle location.",
  "sinks": "The print(where()) statement which outputs the CA bundle path to the console.",
  "flows": "The code imports a trusted library (certifi), then calls 'where()' to retrieve the CA bundle path, and outputs it via print. The data flow is straightforward and originates from a trusted source to output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is simple, uses standard library calls, and outputs a known trusted resource.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, which is a well-known library for handling CA certificates. It then prints the path returned by 'where()'. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated logic, or external data inputs. The purpose is to display the CA bundle location. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, primarily intended to display the default CA bundle path used for HTTPS verification. There is no malicious intent or security risk evident.",
