{
  "purpose": "This script outputs the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package, serving as an informational utility.",
  "sources": "The code reads the certifi 'where' function, which provides the path to the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "The script prints the CA bundle path; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Source: certifi 'where' function; Sink: print statement outputting the path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'where' from certifi and prints its output when executed directly. It performs a simple, trusted operation with no data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate, though a score of 0 for securityRisk is more precise. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that safely outputs the CA bundle path. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are consistent with its behavior, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
