{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to return the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package, primarily for use in configuring SSL/TLS verification.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the 'where' function to determine the CA bundle location.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' output could potentially leak the filesystem path of the CA bundle, but this is generally benign and intended for informational purposes.",
  "flows": "The code calls certifi.where() as a source, then outputs the result via print(), which could be considered an informational sink. No untrusted data flows or user inputs are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward, with a simple import and output statement.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from certifi and prints the path to the default CA bundle. It is intended for use as a utility to display the CA bundle location. There are no indications of malicious intent, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal, standard, and does not perform any network, filesystem, or other sensitive operations beyond printing a known, safe path.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a utility function to display the default CA bundle location used by certifi. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
