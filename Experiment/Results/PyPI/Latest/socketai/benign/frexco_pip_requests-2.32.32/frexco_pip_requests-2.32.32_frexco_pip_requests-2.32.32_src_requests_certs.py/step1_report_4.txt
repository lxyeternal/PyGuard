{
  "purpose": "This script outputs the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for configuration or packaging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the certifi package to get the CA bundle location via the where() function.",
  "sinks": "The output (via print) reveals the CA bundle path; no other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The source (certifi.where()) feeds directly into the print statement, with no further processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward, importing certifi to retrieve the standard CA bundle path and printing it. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, no network activity, or suspicious behavior. The purpose appears to be informational or configuration-related. The code is minimal, clear, and aligns with typical usage for CA bundle configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a simple utility function with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
