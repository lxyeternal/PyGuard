{
  "purpose": "The code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the 'certifi' package, primarily for verifying SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location via the 'where()' function from the 'certifi' library.",
  "sinks": "The printed CA bundle path could be used in other code for SSL verification, but by itself, it does not process untrusted data or perform network actions.",
  "flows": "The source (certifi.where()) provides the CA bundle path, which is then printed to standard output; there are no other data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and intended for configuration or informational purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from 'certifi' to obtain the default CA bundle location. When executed directly, it prints this path. There are no user inputs, network interactions, or data manipulations. The code serves a simple utility role and does not contain any malicious or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that outputs the default CA bundle path from 'certifi'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
