{
  "purpose": "Provide the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package and called in the main block",
  "sinks": "The printed output of the 'where()' function, which is the path to the CA bundle",
  "flows": "User runs the script -> 'where()' is called -> path is printed to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports or code patterns",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' to retrieve the path to the CA bundle. It then prints this path if executed directly. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious logic, obfuscated elements, or malicious code. The use of 'certifi' is standard in Python security contexts for SSL verification. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code's purpose is limited to outputting a certificate bundle path, which is a legitimate and common operation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves a simple utility purpose without any malicious intent or security risks. It correctly retrieves and displays the CA bundle location, with no anomalies or suspicious activity detected.",
