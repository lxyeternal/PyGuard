  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports describe the same setup script for the 'requests' package.\n- The script uses `exec()` to read version info from `__version__.py`.\n- It executes system commands via `os.system()` for publishing.\n- No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code is observed.\n- The primary concern is the use of `exec()` on a potentially tampered file and `os.system()` calls.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  - The use of `exec()` on `__version__.py` is standard but risky if the file is compromised.\n  - The `os.system()` calls are typical but can be dangerous if inputs are manipulated—though in this context, they are only executed with fixed arguments.\n\n- **Malicious code or backdoors?**  \n  - No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malware in the provided code.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  - The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-by-Issue Analysis:\n\n#### 1. Use of `exec()` to load version info\n- **Risk:** Moderate. While common in setup scripts, if `__version__.py` is tampered with, arbitrary code could execute.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (no malicious intent) — agreed.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — acceptable, given the potential for code execution if the file is compromised.\n\n#### 2. `os.system()` calls for publishing\n- **Risk:** Low to moderate. They execute shell commands directly, but only when the `publish` argument is provided.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — reasonable, as this is standard but should be used cautiously.\n\n#### 3. No hardcoded credentials or secrets\n- **Confirmed:** No such issues.\n\n---\n\n### Scores Justification:\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0 — consistent and justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n  - Risk: 0.2 — justified, given the `exec()` and `os.system()` usage.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports uniformly assign a **security risk of 0.2**, which seems appropriate.  \n- The malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is typical for a setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The only minor concern is the `exec()` on a version file, which should be validated in secure environments.\n- The `os.system()` commands are standard but should be used cautiously, especially if command-line arguments could be manipulated.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — due to `exec()` and `os.system()` usage, which are common but potentially risky if files are compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is standard for a Python setup script, with minimal security concerns that are typical in such scripts. No evidence of supply chain attacks or malicious behavior is present.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nProceed with standard security practices, including validating the contents of `__version__.py` if possible.",
