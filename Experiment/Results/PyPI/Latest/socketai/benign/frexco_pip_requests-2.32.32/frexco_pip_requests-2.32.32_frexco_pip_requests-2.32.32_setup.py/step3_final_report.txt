  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the 'requests' library, performing version checks, reading metadata, and defining dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '__version__.py' via exec(), command-line arguments, and dependencies declarations.",
  "sinks": "os.system() calls for publishing, exec() execution of version file.",
  "flows": "Input: sys.argv, version file content; Output: system commands for publishing, version info loaded into 'about'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info, direct os.system() calls for publishing without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with minimal security risks. The exec() call on a local version file could execute malicious code if the file is compromised. The os.system() commands are standard but should be used cautiously. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The scores across reports are consistent, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, which is appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup file with minor security considerations due to exec() and os.system(). No malicious activity or supply chain attack evident. Maintaining the current scores is justified.",
