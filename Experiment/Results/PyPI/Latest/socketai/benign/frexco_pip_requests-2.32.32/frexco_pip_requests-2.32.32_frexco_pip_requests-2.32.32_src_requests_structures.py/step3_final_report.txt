{
  "purpose": "Provides case-insensitive dictionary-like objects for handling headers and lookup data in Python.",
  "sources": "In-memory data structures, primarily using internal dictionaries and ordered dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network activity, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data is stored and retrieved within class methods; no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The copy() method in CaseInsensitiveDict returns self._store.values(), which is a generator, not a proper copy. This is a bug, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, well-understood data structures for case-insensitive headers and lookup dictionaries. No external data fetching, code obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected. The only notable issue is the bug in the copy() method, which does not impact security but affects functionality. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility code for managing headers and lookups. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The minor bug in the copy() method should be corrected for proper functionality but does not influence security assessment.",
