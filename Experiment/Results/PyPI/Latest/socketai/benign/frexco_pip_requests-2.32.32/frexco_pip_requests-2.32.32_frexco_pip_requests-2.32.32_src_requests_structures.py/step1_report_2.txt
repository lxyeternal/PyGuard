  "purpose": "Define data structures for handling HTTP headers and lookup dictionaries in a case-insensitive manner, mainly used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), data manipulation methods (__setitem__, update), and attribute access (__getitem__, get).",
  "sinks": "Data retrieval methods (__getitem__, get), string representations (__repr__).",
  "flows": "Input data to internal storage via update or __setitem__, then data is retrieved through __getitem__ or get methods, and representations via __repr__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, well-understood classes for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries. No external input processing that could lead to injection or malicious code. Methods are straightforward, focusing on data storage and retrieval with case insensitivity. No evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The use of OrderedDict and dictionary methods is standard practice. Overall, the code appears safe and standard within the context of a HTTP request library.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code implements safe, standard data structures for handling HTTP headers and lookup data, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
