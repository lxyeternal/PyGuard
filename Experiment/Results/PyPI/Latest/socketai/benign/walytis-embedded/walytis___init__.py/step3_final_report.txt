  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, filesystem, network sources, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), import statements.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file write operations, system calls, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables, filesystem, or user input to dynamic execution or network functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, suspicious patterns, dynamic imports, incomplete code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code in Report 1 shows suspicion due to patterns like eval/exec and obfuscation, justifying a malware score of 0.4 and a security risk of 0.6. The confidence is 0.7, aligning with the suspicion but lacking concrete evidence. Reports 2 through 5 show no suspicious patterns, with scores appropriately low (malware 0, risk 0.1-0.2). Given the limited evidence, the overall suspicion is moderate, primarily driven by Report 1. The obfuscation suspicion (0.6) is consistent with the described patterns. The scores across reports are coherent with their analyses.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1 indicates potential malicious constructs, justifying a malware score of 0.4, obfuscation of 0.6, and risk of 0.6. Other reports are benign with low scores. The overall assessment suggests moderate concern primarily due to patterns in Report 1, but no definitive malicious code is confirmed. Minor score adjustments for risk in reports 2-5 are recommended to reflect their benign nature.",
