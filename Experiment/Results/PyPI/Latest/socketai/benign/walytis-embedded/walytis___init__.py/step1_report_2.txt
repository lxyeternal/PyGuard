  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, environment variables, or possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if any are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input parameters or environment variables through processing functions, possibly reaching sinks like network, file system, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution were identified. The code structure appears standard; however, the absence of comments or explicit security checks warrants caution.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined in detail, including imports, variable usage, function definitions, and execution flow. No malicious patterns like data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors were evident. It uses standard Python features and libraries, and no unusual or obfuscated code constructs were detected. The code's behavior is typical of legitimate utility or processing scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It appears to be a benign script with no suspicious activities or security risks identified. Nonetheless, without additional context or runtime data, the assessment relies solely on static review.",
