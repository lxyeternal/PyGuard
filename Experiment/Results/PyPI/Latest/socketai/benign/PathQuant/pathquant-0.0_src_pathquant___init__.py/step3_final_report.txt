  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for a histopathology AI workflow project, including author, email, and status information.",
  "sources": "None; only metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __status__) and comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; no executable code or data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "None; code consists solely of descriptive metadata and comments, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only metadata variables and comments describing the project purpose. No executable logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless metadata snippet with no security concerns or malicious intent. The current scores are justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
