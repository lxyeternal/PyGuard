  "purpose": "AI workflow to quantify histopathology in whole slide images.",
  "sources": "Author, email, and status metadata variables; no other data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow evident beyond setting metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious constructs. Metadata variables are straightforward and contain no secrets or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of descriptive comments and metadata variable assignments with no functional logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The structure is typical for a project header or documentation stub. No inputs, outputs, or code execution paths are present to analyze further.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple metadata stub describing a project related to histopathology AI workflows. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious activity, and no security risks. It appears to be a benign placeholder or documentation fragment.",
