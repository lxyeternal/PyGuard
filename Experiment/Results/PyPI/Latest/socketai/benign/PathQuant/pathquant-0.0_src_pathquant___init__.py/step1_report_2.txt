  "purpose": "AI workflow to quantify histopathology in whole slide images.",
  "sources": "Read access to module metadata (__author__, __email__, __status__). No user input or data input observed.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; only static metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials beyond author info, which is typical in metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal header with descriptive comments and author metadata. No functions, data processing, or logic present. It does not perform any operations or data handling that could be malicious. No obfuscation, suspicious imports, or code execution detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple project description with author metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. The overall security risk is negligible.",
