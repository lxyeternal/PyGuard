  "purpose": "Define the purpose of the code as an AI workflow to quantify histopathology in whole slide images.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are explicitly defined in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows since the code only contains metadata and comments.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only metadata comments and author information, with no executable or data-processing logic; no anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of descriptive comments and metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __status__) that specify the purpose and authorship details. No executable code, data handling, or library imports are present, which limits the scope for security concerns. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears to be a placeholder or initial documentation snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-executable metadata block describing a project related to histopathology AI workflows. It shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The code is safe based on the provided content.",
