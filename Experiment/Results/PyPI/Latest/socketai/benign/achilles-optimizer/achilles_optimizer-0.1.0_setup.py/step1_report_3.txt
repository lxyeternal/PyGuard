{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the script's own execution context, primarily the '__main__' condition and the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data; setup() is a standard function for package configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions; the flow is straightforward and static.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports the setup function from setuptools and calls it when executed directly. It contains no input handling, no data processing, no network communication, and no suspicious behavior. This is a common pattern for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a standard setup script for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
