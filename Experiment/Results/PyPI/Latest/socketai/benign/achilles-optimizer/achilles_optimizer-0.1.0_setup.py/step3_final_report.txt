  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The script reads no external data; it imports 'setup' from 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "The script executes 'setup()' when run as main; no data flows or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls it within a '__main__' guard. It contains no arguments, data, or dynamic behavior. The code is a typical minimal setup script, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and standard pattern confirm the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
