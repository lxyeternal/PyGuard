{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it simply imports a module and executes a function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the setup() function does not process untrusted data or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the code only calls setup().",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() within a standard __main__ guard. This pattern is typical for Python package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code. The absence of additional arguments or custom logic indicates it's a plain package setup script without embedded malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
