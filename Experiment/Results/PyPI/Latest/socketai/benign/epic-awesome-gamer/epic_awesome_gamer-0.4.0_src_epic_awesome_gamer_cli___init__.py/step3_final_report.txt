  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, data flow points, network communication, file access, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or data read points to sinks like network transmission, file system, or environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation, with scores of malware 0 and obfuscation 0. Confidence levels are moderate to high due to limited code context. Risk scores are low (0.2-0.3), reflecting cautious assessments consistent with benign findings. No anomalies or suspicious patterns identified. The reasoning aligns with the evidence, and scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low risk scores are appropriate given the analysis. The assessments are consistent and justified, indicating a safe dependency with minimal security concerns.",
