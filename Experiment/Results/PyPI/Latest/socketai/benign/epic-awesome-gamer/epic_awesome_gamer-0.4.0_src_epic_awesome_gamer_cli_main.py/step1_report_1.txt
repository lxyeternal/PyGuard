  "purpose": "A command-line tool for collecting free Epic Games from the Epic Games Store, with integrated browser automation and CAPTCHA solving.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for EPIC_EMAIL, EPIC_PASSWORD, GEMINI_API_KEY; command-line options for email, password, API key, and user data directory.",
  "sinks": "None evident explicitly; code interacts with web browsers and external APIs, but no data leakage or malicious actions are directly implemented.",
  "flows": "Inputs from environment variables and command-line options flow into setting configuration variables; these are used in initializing the browser automation and Epic agent.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of environment variables for sensitive credentials is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures observed. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected. Help command handles subcommands with complex context navigation, but this is typical for CLI apps.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a CLI with multiple commands, mainly 'collect', which uses asynchronous browser automation to log into Epic Games and collect free games. Environment variables for credentials and API keys are used securely via envvar options, not hardcoded. The code imports modules for browser automation, CAPTCHA solving, and API interactions but does not contain any code that performs network communication outside these libraries. No malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access is present. No obfuscated or suspicious logic detected. The overall structure and flow are consistent with legitimate automation and CLI tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate automation tool for Epic Games collection, utilizing environment variables and command-line options securely. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a standard CLI with browser automation for a specific purpose, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors identified.",
