  "purpose": "A CLI tool for automating the collection of free Epic Games from the Epic Games Store using browser automation and CAPTCHA solving.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (EPIC_EMAIL, EPIC_PASSWORD, GEMINI_API_KEY), CLI options, external libraries (playwright, hcaptcha_challenger, etc.) for automation and API interactions.",
  "sinks": "Browser automation actions, API calls, environment variables used for credentials, network requests during automation.",
  "flows": "Credentials sourced from environment variables flow into the automation setup; browser automation interacts with Epic Games Store; no external data exfiltration detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; complex command context navigation is standard for CLI apps.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward automation CLI for Epic Games collection, relying on environment variables for credentials and external libraries for browser automation. No malicious code, backdoors, or network exfiltration are present. The use of environment variables and external dependencies is typical but warrants secure handling. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3 are justified based on dependency trust and credential handling, but no active threats are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, low-risk automation tool with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects standard practices and the absence of suspicious activity.",
