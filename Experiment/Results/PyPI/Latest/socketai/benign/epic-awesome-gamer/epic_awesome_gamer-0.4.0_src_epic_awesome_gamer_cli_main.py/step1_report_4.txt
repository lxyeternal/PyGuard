  "purpose": "A command-line tool for collecting free Epic Games, potentially automating browser actions and API interactions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (EPIC_EMAIL, EPIC_PASSWORD, GEMINI_API_KEY), command-line options, imported modules, and the code's own logic.",
  "sinks": "Async browser automation (playwright), network requests via imported modules, environment variables, and potential external API interactions.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and command-line options flow into the EpicSettings and AgentConfig objects, which then influence browser automation and API calls. The async functions initiate browser sessions and interact with external services.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or suspicious code structures. The code performs standard command-line parsing, environment variable handling, and async browser automation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident. External module imports are typical for automation and API interactions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a command-line application built with Typer, designed to automate the collection of free Epic Games using browser automation and API modules. It retrieves sensitive info such as emails and passwords from environment variables or options, which is standard practice. The code uses asyncio and playwright for web automation, which can be misused if malicious intent exists, but in this context, appears to be for legitimate automation. No data exfiltration, system modification, or suspicious network activity is explicitly implemented. The help command dynamically searches commands, and the main function runs the app. Overall, the code adheres to typical automation scripts without signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate automation tool for collecting Epic Games, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles sensitive info via environment variables and performs standard web automation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signals are detected.",
