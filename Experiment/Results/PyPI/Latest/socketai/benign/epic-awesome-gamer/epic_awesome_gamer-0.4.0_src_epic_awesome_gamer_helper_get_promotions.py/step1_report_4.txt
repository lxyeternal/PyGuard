{
  "purpose": "Fetches promotion data for free games from Epic Games store, focusing on current and upcoming promotions.",
  "sources": "httpx.get() request to a remote URL; access to response.json() data; reading from imported modules; access to global constants.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of URLs to dictionary entries; creation of PromotionGame objects with unpacked data.",
  "flows": "HTTP response data -> JSON parsing -> filtering for free promotions -> URL construction -> PromotionGame instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; exception handling is broad but appropriate; URLs are static; no suspicious or malicious code paths.",
  "analysis": "The code makes an HTTP GET request to a specified URL to retrieve promotion data, parses JSON data, and filters for free promotional offers. It constructs URLs based on data fields, handling potential missing keys with broad exception handling. No user input is processed, and there is no dynamic code execution. External dependencies are standard libraries and 'httpx' for HTTP requests, and 'loguru' for logging. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward data retrieval and processing script with proper error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard API data retrieval and filtering for promotional data from a public API. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware are present. The logic is transparent and safe.",
