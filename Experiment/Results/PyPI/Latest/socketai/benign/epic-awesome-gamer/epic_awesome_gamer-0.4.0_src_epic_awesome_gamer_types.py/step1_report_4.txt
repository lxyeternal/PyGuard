{
  "purpose": "This code defines data models for an ordering and promotion system using Pydantic for data validation.",
  "sources": "Input data is likely received via external sources to instantiate the models, but the code itself does not explicitly read input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmission, logging, or output operations are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input into the Pydantic models during instantiation, with no internal processing or data transmission implemented.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code strictly defines data models with no dynamic or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing and Pydantic modules to define structured data models for orders and promotions. No input/output operations or external communication are present. The code is straightforward and appears solely for data validation and structuring purposes. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a schema definition for order and promotion data structures, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It appears to be a standard, harmless data modeling implementation.",
