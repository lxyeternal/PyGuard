  "purpose": "Define data models for an order processing system using Pydantic for validation.",
  "sources": "Input data likely from user, API requests, or external data sources assigned to the model fields.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data is written to external systems or used insecurely within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external sources into the Pydantic models for validation and structure enforcement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and uses Pydantic models to define structured data schemas for orders, promotions, and related entities. All class attributes are simple type annotations without any dynamic execution or suspicious logic. There are no network calls, environment variable usage, or code that manipulates data in insecure ways. The code appears to serve as data validation schemas, which is typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of data models with no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security issues. It functions solely for data validation and structuring, with no indicators of malware or supply chain risk.",
