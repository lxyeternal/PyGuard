  "purpose": "Define data models for order processing and promotions using Pydantic for data validation.",
  "sources": "Input data likely from user input, API requests, or external services fed into Pydantic models.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; data validation occurs within class constructors, no data is executed or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data → Pydantic model instantiation → validated data stored in model instances.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious URLs or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines data models with no executable logic or external calls. Usage of Pydantic provides data validation, which is standard practice. No apparent malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No obfuscation or unusual coding patterns are present. The models could be used in various contexts, but they are purely data schemas.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data schemas for order and promotion data using Pydantic. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, standard data validation module.",
