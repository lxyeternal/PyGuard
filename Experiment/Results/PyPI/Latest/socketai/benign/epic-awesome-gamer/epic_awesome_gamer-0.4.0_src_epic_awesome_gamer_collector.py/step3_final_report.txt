  "purpose": "Automates interactions with Epic Games website to retrieve order history, check login status, and claim free promotional games.",
  "sources": "Web page content via Playwright, API endpoints for order history, DOM attributes for login status",
  "sinks": "Navigation to URLs, DOM attribute access, API calls, JSON parsing",
  "flows": "Input data from webpage content and API responses flow through JSON parsing and DOM attribute checks to decision points for claiming games or updating state",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward logic; exception handling present but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard web automation tasks: navigating to URLs, parsing JSON responses, checking login status via DOM attributes, and managing game promotion data. No signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. External modules are legitimate, and the logic aligns with typical automation scripts. Exception handling is minimal but not indicative of malicious intent. The code's purpose is clear and legitimate, with no suspicious behaviors or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate automation script for Epic Games, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects minimal risk inherent to automation tasks, with no active threats identified.",
