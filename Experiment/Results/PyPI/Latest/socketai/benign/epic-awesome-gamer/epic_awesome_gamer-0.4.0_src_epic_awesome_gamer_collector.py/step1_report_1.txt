{
  "purpose": "This code automates interactions with the Epic Games website to collect promotional games and manage order history, likely for a tool that automates claiming free games.",
  "sources": "Reads from web pages via Playwright (e.g., order history, login status), fetches promotion data via get_promotions(), and accesses environment/config data through imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Sends navigation commands, fetches data from URLs, interacts with the page via Playwright, and calls functions for game collection, which may involve network requests or data processing.",
  "flows": "Sources such as page.goto() and get_promotions() lead to potential data processing and function calls like collect_weekly_games(), but no evidence of data flows leading to malicious external communication or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard libraries and external modules appears normal. No unusual dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code automates browser-based interactions with a legitimate target (Epic Games). It reads user account status, order history, and promotional data, then performs actions to claim free games. All data sources and sinks are standard for such automation. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. External dependencies (playwright, loguru, epic_awesome_gamer) are used legitimately. The logic flows follow expected patterns for a game claim automation tool.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate automation tool for collecting free games from Epic Games. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are evident. The code appears safe, with standard use of external libraries and clear intentions.",
