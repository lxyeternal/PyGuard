{
  "purpose": "The code generates a .env.example file from a pydantic BaseSettings class, extracting environment variable names, defaults, and descriptions to facilitate environment configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads class source code via inspect.getsource, accesses class schema via model_json_schema(), and retrieves type hints with get_type_hints.",
  "sinks": "Writes the generated environment variable definitions and comments to a file (.env.example).",
  "flows": "Extracts class source -> Parses source for fields -> Reads schema properties and type hints -> Formats environment variable entries -> Writes to file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls detected. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The code primarily performs static analysis and file writing.",
  "analysis": "The script processes a pydantic BaseSettings subclass to produce a template environment file. It uses inspect to retrieve source code and regex to identify class fields, ensuring order preservation. It extracts schema descriptions, default values, and handles special types like SecretStr and Literal, formatting comments accordingly. It writes the output to a file, optionally merged from multiple classes. The code performs typical static analysis and file I/O without network activity or system modification. No malicious or malicious-looking behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for generating environment configuration templates from pydantic classes. It performs static source parsing, schema extraction, and file writing without suspicious behavior or malicious intent. No malware or security risks identified.",
