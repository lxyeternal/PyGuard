  "purpose": "Generate a .env.example file from a pydantic BaseSettings class, extracting environment variable names, descriptions, defaults, and choices for documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads class source code via inspect.getsource(), schema info via model_json_schema(), and type hints via get_type_hints().",
  "sinks": "Writes environment variable definitions and comments to a .env.example file.",
  "flows": "Source code is parsed to identify fields, then formatted with comments and defaults, and written to a file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to parse source code, which is fragile but not malicious; handles SecretStr benignly; no obfuscated code or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis to generate environment variable templates, with no network activity, code execution, or data leaks. Regex parsing is fragile but not malicious. Handling of secrets and schema info is safe. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for generating environment variable templates from pydantic classes. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low scores across reports are justified. The primary concern is regex fragility, which does not constitute a security threat.",
