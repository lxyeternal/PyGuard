  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, handling requests, processing data, or other data ingestion points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or other points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions, then to outputs or network transmissions, indicating data movement pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network calls, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code, with benign descriptions. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the absence of suspicious patterns. Given the lack of code or suspicious activity, the assessments are justified. Slightly lowering the risk score to 0.1 for benign code could be considered, but 0.2 remains reasonable. Confidence levels are appropriate, reflecting the limited information in some reports. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected across the provided data.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the scores are justified. No changes are necessary; the overall supply chain security posture appears benign.",
