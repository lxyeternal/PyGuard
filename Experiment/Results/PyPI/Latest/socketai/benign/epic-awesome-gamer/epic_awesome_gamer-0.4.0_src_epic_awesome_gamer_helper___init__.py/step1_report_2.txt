{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server and handle incoming HTTP requests, possibly for a web application or API service.",
  "sources": "Input is read from network requests via HTTP handlers and potentially from environment variables (if used for configuration).",
  "sinks": "Data processed from requests may be used in database queries, system commands, or output back to clients; code execution or data leakage could occur if inputs are not sanitized.",
  "flows": "HTTP request data flows through request handlers, possibly into database queries or command execution; environment variables or config files may influence behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. The code structure appears standard. No unusual or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a web server, defines request handlers, and processes incoming data. It uses common libraries without suspicious imports. No signs of malicious code such as network exfiltration, cryptomining, or backdoors are evident. The code does not perform unsafe SQL or use insecure environment variables in a suspicious manner. The overall logic seems consistent with typical web application code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears to be standard web server setup with no malicious intent detected.",
