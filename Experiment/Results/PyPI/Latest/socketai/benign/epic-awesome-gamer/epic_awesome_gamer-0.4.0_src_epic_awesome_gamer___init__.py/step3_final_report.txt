{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization file, importing specific classes and functions from local modules and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Local module imports: .epic_games and .helper.get_promotions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; static import statements do not process external input.",
  "flows": "No data flows; import statements are static and do not involve runtime data transfer or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, typical of a package's __init__.py. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. Malware scores are consistently zero, and confidence levels are high. The minimal security risk scores are justified given the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's structure and purpose are clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
