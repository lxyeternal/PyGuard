{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and functions related to Epic Games and promotional data retrieval, likely for use in a larger application or script.",
  "sources": "Imports from .epic_games and .helper.get_promotions modules, which may read internal data or external inputs depending on their implementation.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or sensitive data handling are visible in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows can be determined from this snippet alone, as it only imports components and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only standard import and export statements with no unusual patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "This file is a straightforward module that imports classes and functions, and defines an export list. There is no indication of malicious behavior, no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It relies on other modules whose behavior is unknown; however, this code itself appears benign. No external network connections, data leaks, or security issues are evident here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module defining exports for further use. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
