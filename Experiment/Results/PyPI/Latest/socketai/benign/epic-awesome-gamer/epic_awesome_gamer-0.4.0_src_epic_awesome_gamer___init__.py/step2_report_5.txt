  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module that imports specific classes and functions from local modules, then defines `__all__`.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, network operations, or input handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are indicated.\n- The code structure is typical for a Python package's `__init__.py` or similar module setup.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are benign, serving as re-exports for public API exposure.\n- The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating strong agreement that the code is safe.\n- Security risks are minimal, mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting the absence of suspicious operations.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No issues are identified in the code itself.\n- The only minor note is that some reports assign a very small security risk (0.1), perhaps due to the general caution about package imports, but this is not justified by any actual risk in this code.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Appropriately low, given the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a standard, safe module setup with no security concerns.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a very conservative, minimal risk score for package import modules, but practically negligible)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code is entirely benign. No changes needed in the scoring or analysis.",
