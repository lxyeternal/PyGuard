{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a package initialization or module setup, importing specific classes and functions related to Epic Games and promotion retrieval.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .epic_games (EpicGames, EpicSettings) and .helper.get_promotions (get_promotions).",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating handling of untrusted data or executing untrusted input directly; the code only imports modules and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable here as the code only performs imports and sets the __all__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward and typical of a module's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initialization script that imports specific classes and functions from sibling modules within the package. It defines the __all__ variable to specify public API. There are no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The absence of any network, file, or environment variable operations indicates no malicious intent or security issues within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization file that imports modules and defines the public interface. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It is a benign setup script.",
