{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and functions related to Epic Games and promotion retrieval, likely for a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.epic_games' module (EpicGames, EpicSettings) and from '.helper.get_promotions' module (get_promotions)",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no data is processed or output is generated in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling observed within this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward with standard import statements; no suspicious or unusual code structures or hardcoded secrets detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, which is standard in Python modules. It references other modules within the same package (indicated by the leading dot), implying it is part of a larger package. There are no functions, user inputs, environment variable access, network operations, or data processing present. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or security-sensitive operations are visible. The structure appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module file, and nothing suspicious or malicious is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module that imports classes and functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a larger package structure. There is no indication of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
