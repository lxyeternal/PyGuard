{
  "purpose": "Module exports for EpicGames related classes and a helper function, likely part of a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .epic_games and .helper.get_promotions",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or untrusted data handling; no external data input or output operations present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only static imports and export declarations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious constructs, or unusual code patterns; code appears straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module defining its exports by importing specific classes and functions from local submodules. There are no dynamic evaluations, network calls, or data handling logic present. The code's structure is consistent with standard Python module organization, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard module export interface without any malicious intent or security issues. It imports and exposes components from local modules, which is common practice in Python package design.",
