  "purpose": "This code automates interactions with Epic Games' website for login, adding promotions to cart, and purchasing free games.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (EPIC_EMAIL, EPIC_PASSWORD) for login credentials; web page URLs; user inputs via automated browser actions.",
  "sinks": "Automated browser actions such as clicking, typing, navigating, and waiting for specific elements or URLs; network requests for login and transactions.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are used as input for login credentials. These are injected into login forms via automated typing. The flow leads to login, navigation, and interaction with web elements, culminating in game promotion addition and purchase confirmation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suppress to handle exceptions broadly; no clear validation or sanitization of environment variables; reliance on delays and retries which could mask underlying issues; no obfuscation or uncommon code patterns; no hardcoded secrets apart from environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code automates Epic Games account login and game promotion management via browser automation (Playwright). It uses environment variables for credentials, which are standard. There are no signs of malicious network activity, such as data exfiltration or unauthorized system access. The code does not include backdoors, hidden network connections, or destructive actions. Exception handling broadly suppresses errors, which could hide issues but not malicious intent. The logic strictly pertains to web automation for a known purpose, with no suspicious data leakage or harmful operations observed. Overall, the code appears legitimate and focused on automating Epic Games promotional activities without any malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code automates Epic Games promotion activities with no evident malicious intent. It uses environment variables for credentials and browser automation for interactions. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present. The broad exception suppression could hide errors but does not imply malicious behavior.",
