  "purpose": "Automates interaction with Epic Games store for login, cart management, and game collection, including handling CAPTCHA challenges and promotional offers.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (EPIC_EMAIL, EPIC_PASSWORD), user interactions via Playwright (page.goto, page.click, page.type, page.locator), and network responses during web navigation.",
  "sinks": "Uses browser automation to perform login, add items to cart, and checkout. No direct data leaks or external data exfiltration observed. No network connections outside normal browser automation.",
  "flows": "Reads credentials from environment variables, navigates web pages, interacts with login forms and buttons, and performs purchase steps. No suspicious data flow pathways identified.",
  "anomalies": "Contains standard automation procedures; no hardcoded secrets beyond environment variables. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Some commented code and verbose logging, but nothing malicious. Usage of suppress to handle exceptions is typical in web automation scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical automation script for a web-based game store, using Playwright for browser control and Pydantic for configuration management. Sensitive data like credentials are sourced from environment variables and not hardcoded. The script performs login, CAPTCHA handling, cart management, and checkout, which are standard operations. No network connections outside browser automation, no data exfiltration, and no code that would compromise security. No signs of backdoors, hidden malicious code, or malicious behavior are present. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate automation purposes with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard automation script for Epic Games store interactions, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It responsibly manages credentials via environment variables and performs typical web automation tasks. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks identified.",
