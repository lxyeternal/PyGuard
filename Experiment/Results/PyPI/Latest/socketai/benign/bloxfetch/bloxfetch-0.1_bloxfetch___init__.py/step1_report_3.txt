  "purpose": "This code imports all definitions from the 'main' module within the same package, likely for executing or re-exporting functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module ('main'). No direct data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external output functions present in this line.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the line only performs an import without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The statement is a standard Python import, importing everything from a local module. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up access to functions or variables defined elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this single import statement, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be a normal code pattern, but further code review would be needed to confirm overall security.",
