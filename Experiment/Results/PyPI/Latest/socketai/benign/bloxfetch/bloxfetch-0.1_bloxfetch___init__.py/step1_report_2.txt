{
  "purpose": "Import all definitions and functionalities from the module 'main' within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'main' module from the local package.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this line.",
  "flows": "N/A - Only an import statement, no data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .main import *' can obscure which components are imported, but it is a common practice for module imports and does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement that pulls in all symbols from a local 'main' module. It does not execute any code by itself beyond importing, and no data processing, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The import style ('*') can be considered poor practice but not suspicious by itself. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present in this statement.",
  "conclusion": "This code line is a standard import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely imports all contents from a local module, which is common in Python projects.",
