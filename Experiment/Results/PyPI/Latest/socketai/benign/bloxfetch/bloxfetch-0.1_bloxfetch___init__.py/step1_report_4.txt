  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the 'main' module within the same package",
  "sources": "Import statement that loads code from a local module (.main)",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present in this statement",
  "flows": "No data flows can be determined from this single import statement alone",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') which can obscure actual imported elements, but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a relative import from the 'main' module, which is a common practice in Python package structures. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior. The import statement itself does not execute any code or handle data directly; it merely references other code. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious logic visible. The use of 'from .main import *' can sometimes hide imported functions, but on its own, it is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply includes code from a local module. There is no evidence of malware, data leaks, or suspicious activity based on this snippet alone.",
