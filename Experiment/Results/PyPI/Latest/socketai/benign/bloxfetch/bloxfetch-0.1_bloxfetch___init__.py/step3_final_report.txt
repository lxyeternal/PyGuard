{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of all symbols from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; potential data or code within the 'main' module (not provided).",
  "sinks": "None directly in this snippet; if 'main' contains malicious code, it could execute upon import.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads 'main' module; any malicious code within 'main' could execute during import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can cause namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import, with no code execution, data handling, or network activity visible. The import style ('*') is poor practice but not malicious. Without the contents of 'main', no malicious behavior can be confirmed. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. Security risk is minimal, around 0.1, mainly due to namespace pollution concerns. The code appears benign, and the scores are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary given the limited context.",
