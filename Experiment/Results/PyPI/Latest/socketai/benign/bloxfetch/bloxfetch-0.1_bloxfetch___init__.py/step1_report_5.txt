  "purpose": "Imports all contents from the module named 'main' in the current package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; potential for imported code to contain sinks.",
  "flows": "Imported module's code execution flows into the current namespace; no direct source-to-sink flow in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .main import *' can lead to namespace pollution, but not inherently malicious. No malicious code or backdoors visible here.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a relative import of all symbols from the 'main' module within the same package. The code is minimal, with no obfuscated patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. The actual behavior depends on the contents of 'main', which is not provided. The import statement itself is standard, but importing everything with '*' can be risky in larger contexts due to namespace pollution. No signs of malware or malicious activity are apparent in this single line.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard relative import statement. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues based solely on this line. However, the overall security assessment depends on the contents of the imported module.",
