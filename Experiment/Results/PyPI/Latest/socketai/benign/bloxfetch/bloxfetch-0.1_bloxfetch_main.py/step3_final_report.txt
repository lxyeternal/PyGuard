{
  "purpose": "Fetches Roblox user data, avatar, and headshot URLs via public APIs, encapsulated in a User class.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests to Roblox API endpoints for user info, avatar, and headshot data.",
  "sinks": "JSON responses parsed and stored in object attributes; no untrusted data is executed or logged.",
  "flows": "Input user_id and size → URL construction → HTTP requests → JSON parsing → data assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API calls with proper error handling, input validation, and data parsing. It accesses public endpoints without executing untrusted code or storing sensitive data. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The only minor concern is the construction of URLs with user-controlled parameters, which could be misused if URLs are mishandled externally, but this is a typical pattern for API wrappers and does not constitute a vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward API wrapper for Roblox user data, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and justified given the minimal operational exposure. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
