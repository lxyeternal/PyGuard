{
  "purpose": "This code fetches Roblox user information, avatar, and headshot URLs based on a user ID.",
  "sources": "Requests to Roblox API endpoints: 'https://users.roblox.com/v1/users/{user_id}', 'https://thumbnails.roblox.com/v1/users/avatar', and 'https://thumbnails.roblox.com/v1/users/avatar-headshot'.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally and stored in class attributes; no direct sink for untrusted data beyond data retrieval and storage.",
  "flows": "Input user_id is used to construct API request URLs; responses are parsed to extract user data and image URLs, which are stored in object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code; use of standard requests library and straightforward API calls. No hidden backdoors or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a User object with a user ID and optional size parameter. It then fetches user details, avatar, and headshot URLs via standard Roblox API endpoints using HTTP GET requests. The data is processed and stored in object attributes. Error handling is performed for network exceptions. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident; third-party requests are typical for such a service. No suspicious data flow or code anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward API wrapper for Roblox user data, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply retrieves and stores user data, assuming the user ID is valid and the API responses are legitimate. No malicious intent or sabotage observed.",
