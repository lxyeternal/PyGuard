{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to fetch and encapsulate Roblox user data, including profile details and avatar images, from Roblox APIs.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments (user_id, size) and makes HTTP GET requests to Roblox API endpoints to fetch user data, avatar URL, and headshot URL.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can influence the construction of URLs and the storage of response data within object attributes. The code does not directly write to files, execute code, or send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input user_id is used to build API request URLs, which are fetched via requests.get(). The JSON responses are parsed, and data is stored in object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present. Error handling is standard. The API URLs are static and publicly available, with no malicious parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API data fetching with proper error handling. It validates 'size' parameter against allowed options. Responses are parsed for user details and image URLs, with fallback values if data is missing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or supply chain attacks. Usage of requests library and JSON parsing are normal. No obfuscated or hidden code is present. The data fetched is publicly available, and the code does not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward API wrapper for Roblox user data with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard HTTP requests and data parsing, and it does not include any suspicious or harmful code behavior.",
