{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to fetch user details, avatar URL, and headshot URL from the Roblox API for a given user ID and size.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the function arguments 'user_id' and 'size'. It also makes HTTP GET requests to external Roblox API endpoints to fetch user details and images.",
  "sinks": "The data retrieved from the API responses are assigned to object attributes; the HTTP requests themselves are sinks where untrusted data (responses) are processed.",
  "flows": "Input 'user_id' and 'size' flow into API URL construction; API responses flow into JSON parsing and attribute assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard API requests and JSON parsing without unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No dynamic code execution or suspicious URL patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code makes straightforward HTTP requests to known Roblox API endpoints to fetch user data and images, then assigns these to class attributes. Error handling is in place for network exceptions. Usage of external requests is typical for such a functionality. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The data fetched and stored appear to be publicly accessible user information and image URLs. The code does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks. It operates as a typical API wrapper with no evident security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign API wrapper for Roblox user data. It performs standard data fetching and assignment with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
