  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation & Issue Presence:**\n   - The code is a straightforward API wrapper fetching user info, avatar, and headshot URLs from Roblox's public APIs.\n   - All reports confirm that the code performs standard API requests, JSON parsing, and data storage without any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The code handles request errors appropriately.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; they correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or security issues are evident.\n   - The reports correctly note that the data fetched is publicly accessible and that the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 or very close to 0 (0.1 in one report)\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The overall risk scores are low, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The code only performs data fetching from a public API.\n   - No user data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection detected.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain very low, close to zero.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.\n   - The code does not perform any harmful actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are supported by the code and the analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n   - The data fetched is public, and the code's purpose is transparent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are low, indicating no security concerns.\n   - The slight securityRisk of 0.1 in one report might reflect minimal exposure risk, but it's still very low.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks detected)\n\n**Final Expert Estimate:**\n\nBased on the comprehensive review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, standard API interaction code with no security issues.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
