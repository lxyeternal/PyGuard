{
  "purpose": "To fetch and encapsulate Roblox user data, including avatar and headshot URLs, using the Roblox API.",
  "sources": "The code reads user_id (argument), and performs HTTP GET requests to Roblox API endpoints to retrieve user details, avatar, and headshot data.",
  "sinks": "The untrusted data is used in constructing API request URLs and may influence request behavior, but since these are standard API calls with user-controlled parameters, the main risk is data exposure if URLs are mishandled or logged.",
  "flows": "User input (user_id and size) is used to generate API request URLs; these URLs are called via requests.get; responses are parsed as JSON and assigned to class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious URL manipulation; error handling is standard; no malicious or unusual logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it constructs API request URLs using the provided user_id and size, then fetches data from Roblox APIs. It handles potential request exceptions properly. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. Usage of third-party requests library is standard. No anomalies such as backdoors, hidden behaviors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate API calls to fetch user data from Roblox, with proper error handling and no suspicious or malicious code detected. It appears safe and intended for standard use.",
