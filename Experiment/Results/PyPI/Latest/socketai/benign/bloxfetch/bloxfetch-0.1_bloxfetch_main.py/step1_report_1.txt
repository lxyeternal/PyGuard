{
  "purpose": "The code fetches user data, avatar, and headshot URLs from the Roblox API and constructs a User object with this information.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments (user_id, size) and makes HTTP GET requests to Roblox API endpoints to fetch user details, avatar, and headshot URLs.",
  "sinks": "The code processes JSON responses from the HTTP requests and assigns URLs and user information to object attributes; it does not directly output untrusted data or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (user_id, size) are used to construct URLs for HTTP requests; responses are parsed, and data is stored in object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or obfuscated code; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely uses requests to fetch data from public Roblox API endpoints, handling potential request errors. It performs standard API interactions, parsing JSON data and assigning it to object attributes. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or privacy violations are detected. The size parameter validation prevents injection or misuse. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for fetching Roblox user data via public APIs. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe to use.",
