  "purpose": "Package setup configuration for distributing a Python package named 'bloxfetch'.",
  "sources": "Static strings in setup() parameters: name, version, description, long_description; find_packages() for package discovery; install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow from external inputs or network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow or external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical static setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, user input, or network activity. The long_description mentions 'fetch_user()' and user attributes, but these are only in descriptive strings, not executable code. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this script. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. Scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package configuration script with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate; no further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
