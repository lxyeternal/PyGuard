{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the package 'bloxfetch' for distribution, including its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Code reads static strings and imports 'setuptools' functions; no input data is read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or external communication occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies the package name, version, description, long description, packages found automatically, and a single dependency ('requests'). All operations are static, straightforward, and typical for Python package setup scripts. There are no runtime data inputs, no external network connections, and no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
