  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'bloxfetch' Python package including its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Code reads static strings defining package metadata; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script only defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies. It specifies package name, version, description, long description, included packages, and required dependencies. All elements are static and standard. No dynamic code execution, no input reading, no suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The script simply defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious or harmful code.",
