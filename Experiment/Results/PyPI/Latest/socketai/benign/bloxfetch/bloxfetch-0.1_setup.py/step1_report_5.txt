  "purpose": "Define and configure the 'bloxfetch' Python package for distribution",
  "sources": "Package metadata (name, version, description, long_description), dependencies list ('requests')",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks in the code",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static setup configuration without data flow or user input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward package setup with no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools to configure package distribution. It specifies package details and dependencies. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external data processing are present. The 'install_requires' includes only the widely used 'requests' library. The code is standard and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is a normal package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
