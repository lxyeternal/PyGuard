{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'bloxfetch' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version, description, long_description) and dependencies (requests).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines setup parameters and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for package distribution. It defines package metadata and dependencies with no dynamic code execution, network communication, or suspicious patterns. The 'long_description' string mentions usage instructions but does not execute or fetch data. There are no code injection points or malicious behaviors evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign package configuration.",
