  "purpose": "A SQL query builder for SQLAlchemy ORM models, supporting SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and OFFSET clauses, generating SQL strings based on method calls.",
  "sources": "Method inputs such as columns, conditions, join parameters, and model attributes; internal state variables holding query components.",
  "sinks": "Generated SQL query strings assembled via string concatenation and formatting, which are executed or sent to a database engine.",
  "flows": "Inputs (columns, conditions, joins) flow into internal state variables, then into string assembly functions that produce the final SQL query.",
  "anomalies": "Uses string formatting for SQL generation without parameterization; potential injection risk. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs SQL queries by concatenating strings, escaping string literals but not using parameterized queries. It relies on model metadata and user inputs, which could lead to SQL injection if inputs are untrusted. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code is a standard query builder with potential security vulnerabilities related to input sanitization, but no malware or covert activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SQL query builder with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the potential for SQL injection if inputs are not validated externally. Scores are consistent: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=approximately 0.5 to reflect moderate concern over injection vulnerabilities.",
