  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected in import statement",
  "analysis": "The code imports several components (QueryBuilder, Condition, ConditionGroup, Operator) from a relative module named 'query_builder'. The snippet is a simple import statement without executable logic or data handling. No malicious behavior or security risks can be inferred solely from an import statement. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code here.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard import statement for query-related classes and functions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
