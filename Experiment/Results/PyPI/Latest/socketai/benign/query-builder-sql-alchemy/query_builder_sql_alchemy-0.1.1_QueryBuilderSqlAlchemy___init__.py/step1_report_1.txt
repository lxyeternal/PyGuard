  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing classes related to building database queries, likely for constructing SQL or similar query languages.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module .query_builder, specifically QueryBuilder, Condition, ConditionGroup, Operator.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows present in this minimal import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures; the import statement is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement bringing in query construction classes from a local module. No execution, data processing, or suspicious behavior is evident. Since this is only an import line, there are no sources or sinks, and no data flow or anomalies are present. It appears to be part of a larger codebase responsible for query building.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as part of a query-building module without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
