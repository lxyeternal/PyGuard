  "purpose": "This code is a module import statement that brings in classes and operators related to building database queries.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.query_builder' (relative import)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this snippet; potential sinks would be in code using these imported classes",
  "flows": "No execution flow within this snippet; imported classes may be used elsewhere to build and execute queries",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in this import statement; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple import statement that pulls specific classes and operators from a local module named 'query_builder'. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or network operations. Since it only defines dependencies, it cannot be malicious by itself. No suspicious patterns or anomalous behavior are evident. The focus of this code is on modularity and code organization.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports classes likely used for query construction elsewhere in the project.",
