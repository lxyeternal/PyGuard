  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .query_builder import QueryBuilder, Condition, ConditionGroup, Operator\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code is a straightforward import statement from a local module `.query_builder`.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or external input/output is present.\n- The import appears standard for modular codebases.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity are evident from this import statement alone.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing the reports:\nAll five reports uniformly describe this as a simple import statement, emphasizing its benign nature. They do not identify any anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent. The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), and all reports agree that this code snippet is safe.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify the code as a benign import statement.\n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are apparent.\n- They appropriately conclude that there are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1, which is acceptable given the minimal context. Since the code is only an import, the risk is negligible.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nThe one report with a security risk score of 0.1 could be adjusted to 0, as there is no evidence of any security concern from this snippet.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all reports assign 0 or near-zero scores, and no malicious activity is observed, there's no justification for higher scores.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities, focusing solely on the import statement.\n- No unwarranted claims are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or at most 0.1 in one report, but better to standardize to 0)\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the context and the reports, I agree with the assessments that this code is safe and not malicious.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, benign import statement.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- Scores should remain at 0 for malware and obfuscated, with a risk score of 0.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed; all assessments are accurate and justified.",
