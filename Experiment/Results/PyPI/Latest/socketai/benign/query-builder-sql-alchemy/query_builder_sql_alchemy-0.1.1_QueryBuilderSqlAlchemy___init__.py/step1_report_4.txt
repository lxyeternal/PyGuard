{
  "purpose": "Importing classes and functions related to query building and conditions, likely for database or data filtering operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.query_builder). No external input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points are evident in this minimal code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be established from input to output in this snippet alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from a local module named 'query_builder'. There are no data processing, user inputs, or network interactions. As a minimal import statement, it presents no malicious behavior or security risks by itself. Lack of further context prevents deeper analysis, but based on this fragment alone, no suspicious activity is detectable.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no indication of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger project, and on its own, it poses no security threat.",
