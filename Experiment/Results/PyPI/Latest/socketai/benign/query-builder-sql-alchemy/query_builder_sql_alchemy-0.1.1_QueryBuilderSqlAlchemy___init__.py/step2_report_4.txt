  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward import statement importing classes and constants related to query building from a local module `.query_builder`.\n   - There is no executable logic, data processing, or network activity within these snippets.\n   - The code appears to be part of a larger codebase focused on constructing database queries.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in any of the reports. All reports correctly identify the import as benign and standard.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which aligns with the absence of any evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), consistent with the straightforward import analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities & Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code is only an import statement, it cannot by itself introduce vulnerabilities or malware.\n   - Any potential malicious activity would depend on how these imported classes are used elsewhere, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n   - The reports do not assume or speculate beyond the evidence, maintaining appropriate caution.\n\n5. **Consistency & Justification:**\n   - The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No report suggests a higher risk or malware score unjustifiably.\n   - The minimal code and lack of suspicious patterns justify the low scores.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Without further context or code, it’s impossible to assess whether the imported classes are used maliciously downstream.\n   - However, based solely on this import statement, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security risk from an import statement alone)\n\n### My own estimates:\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the provided scores. The code snippet is benign, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, non-malicious import statement.\n- No evidence suggests malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code poses no security threat based solely on this import statement.",
