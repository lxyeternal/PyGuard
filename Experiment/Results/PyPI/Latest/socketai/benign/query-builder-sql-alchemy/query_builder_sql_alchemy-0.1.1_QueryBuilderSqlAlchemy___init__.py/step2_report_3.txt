  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code snippet is a straightforward import statement: `from .query_builder import QueryBuilder, Condition, ConditionGroup, Operator`.\n   - No signs of malicious code, data processing, or data sinks are present.\n   - The code appears benign and standard for modular Python projects.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment: all identify the code as a benign import statement.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are mostly 0 or very close to 0, aligning with the import-only context.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statement.\n   - Confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), reflecting the clear benign assessment.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - Since all reports agree on the benign nature, no risk scores above 0.5 are justified.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious activity, data handling, or contain malicious constructs.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code snippet does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - No questionable assumptions are made; all assessments are cautious and based solely on the code snippet.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n---\n\n### Final System-Wide Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — no security risk identified.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- Since this is just an import statement, the potential for malicious activity depends entirely on how these imported classes are used elsewhere.\n- Without further context or code that utilizes these classes, there's no reason to suspect any security issue.\n\n**Conclusion**: The current assessments are accurate and appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
