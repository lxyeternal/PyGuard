  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement that brings in classes and constants related to query construction. It does not execute any logic, perform data processing, or contain code that could be malicious by itself. As it stands, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. Without additional context or code, this segment alone is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be part of a larger module responsible for building database queries. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
