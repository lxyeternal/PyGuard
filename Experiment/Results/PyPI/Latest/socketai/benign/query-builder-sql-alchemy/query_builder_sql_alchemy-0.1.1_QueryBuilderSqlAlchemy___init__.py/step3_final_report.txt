  "purpose": "Import classes and constants related to query building from a local module.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .query_builder module, which provides QueryBuilder, Condition, ConditionGroup, Operator.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code only imports modules/classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data sources; purely static import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. All reports agree on its benign nature. The import is standard for modular Python codebases. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign assessment. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are identified. The security posture depends on how these classes are used elsewhere, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward import statement with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
