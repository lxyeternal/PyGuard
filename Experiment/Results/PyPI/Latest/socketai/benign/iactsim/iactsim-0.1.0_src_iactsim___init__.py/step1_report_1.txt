{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with lazy loading of submodules and version handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'utils' and '_version' from 'iactsim'; dynamic import in __getattr__",
  "sinks": "None identified that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or harmful actions",
  "flows": "Importing submodules via __getattr__, accessing '__version__' from '_version'",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ for lazy loading is standard, no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; the exception handling provides a custom error message but is benign",
  "analysis": "The script performs module imports, version management, and dynamic attribute access through __getattr__, following PEP 562. It includes an import error handler that raises an informative message if core modules are missing. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code's structure is typical for a Python package aiming to implement lazy loading of submodules with version control. There are no indications of malware, hidden backdoors, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package loader with lazy imports and version handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are present based on the provided code. It appears to be well-structured and legitimate.",
