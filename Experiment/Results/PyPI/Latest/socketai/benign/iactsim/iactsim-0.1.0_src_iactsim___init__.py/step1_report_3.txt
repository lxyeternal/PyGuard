  "purpose": "Lazy-load submodules and provide a controlled interface for the 'iactsim' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'importlib' and attempted imports of 'iactsim' submodules and version info.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import via '_importlib.import_module' which could execute arbitrary code if module names are manipulated, but in normal operation, this is controlled.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> __getattr__ (when attribute is accessed) -> dynamic import of submodules or main modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ for lazy imports is standard but can be risky if attribute names are externally controlled. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs controlled lazy loading of submodules and main modules of 'iactsim' using importlib. It handles ImportError with a descriptive message. The __getattr__ method dynamically imports modules based on attribute access, which is a common pattern for plugin-like architectures. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The code appears to be a typical plugin loader with proper error handling. The import process is controlled within the package's namespace, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of lazy module import logic for a Python package. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious patterns. It may pose a risk if external input influences attribute names, but in typical use, it appears safe.",
