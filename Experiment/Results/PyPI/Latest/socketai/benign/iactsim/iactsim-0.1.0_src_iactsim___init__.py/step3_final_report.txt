  "purpose": "Implements a Python package with lazy loading of submodules via __getattr__ and __dir__, handling version info and import errors.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from _version, imports submodules and main modules dynamically via __getattr__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; dynamic import is controlled and limited to predefined module names.",
  "flows": "Attribute access triggers __getattr__, which imports modules from 'iactsim' package based on attribute name.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard patterns for lazy loading, no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, controlled implementation of a package loader with lazy imports. It defines static lists of submodules and main attributes, handles import errors gracefully, and uses __getattr__ to import modules only when needed. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The dynamic import is limited to known module names, reducing potential attack surface. The risk of external manipulation is minimal due to the static attribute list. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The controlled dynamic import pattern is standard and safe. The initial risk scores of 0 are appropriate; a minimal risk score (~0.1) could be considered if external influence on attribute names is a concern, but in typical use, it poses no threat.",
