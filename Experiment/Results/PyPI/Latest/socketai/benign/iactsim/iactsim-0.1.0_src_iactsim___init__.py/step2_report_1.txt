  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements a Python package with lazy loading of submodules via `__getattr__` and `__dir__`.\n- Handles import errors with a custom message.\n- Uses static lists of submodules and main attributes.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behavior.\n- No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the code as setting up a package with lazy loading.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior; standard structure.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The confidence is high (1). No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on lazy import management.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; the dynamic import is legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly high risk score given the code's nature. However, since dynamic import can be risky if external input influences attribute names, but here it is controlled. The high risk score seems unwarranted. I would lower it to 0, considering the code's controlled environment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Lazy load submodules, controlled interface.\n- **Findings:** Dynamic import via importlib is standard, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated risk score. Given the code's controlled nature, I would recommend lowering it to 0. The only concern is the dynamic import, but it is explicitly limited to known modules.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Manages lazy importing, exposes attributes.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard package setup with lazy import.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, controlled dynamic import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with malware=0 across all.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation is present; all reports agree.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated in some reports (up to 0.9). Given the code is purely for lazy loading with known module names, the risk is minimal. Dynamic import can be risky if external input influences it, but here, the module names are static and predefined.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured package loader.\n- No malware, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- The risk scores in reports 2 and 3 are overestimated. I recommend setting the risk score to **0** for all reports, as there is no actual security risk here.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimated scores:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|------------|--------------|-------|\n| 0          | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The dynamic import is controlled and standard.\n- No security issues or malicious intent detected.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed justification for these score adjustments.",
