  "purpose": "Lazy import management for the iactsim package, allowing dynamic loading of submodules and handling import errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'importlib' and attempt to import 'utils' and '_version' from 'iactsim'.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import of submodules and attribute access via __getattr__, potential for loading malicious modules if submodule names are manipulated.",
  "flows": "Importlib loads submodules when attributes are accessed; __getattr__ directs to import specific submodules or main module attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ for dynamic module import is unusual but legitimate for lazy loading; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; error handling for import issues is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a mechanism to lazily import submodules and attributes of the 'iactsim' package using __getattr__ and __dir__. It attempts to import core components and version info, with error handling if imports fail. The submodules list defines modules available for dynamic import, and the main dict specifies main attributes. No signs of malicious behavior such as hidden network communication, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The dynamic import approach is common in plugin-like systems, and no suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for lazy module loading and attribute access in a Python package. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code fragment.",
