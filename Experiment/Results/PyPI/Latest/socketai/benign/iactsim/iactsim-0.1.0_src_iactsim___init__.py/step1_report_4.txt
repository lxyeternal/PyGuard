{
  "purpose": "This code manages lazy importing of submodules and exposes certain attributes for the 'iactsim' package.",
  "sources": "Imports 'importlib', attempts to import 'utils' and '_version' from 'iactsim', and reads the '__version__' variable.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Imports submodules dynamically via __getattr__, and sets __all__ to expose these submodules and main modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code. Uses dynamic imports safely for known modules. The license comments and import structure are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a lazy import mechanism for submodules of 'iactsim' using __getattr__, adhering to PEP 562. It handles ImportError by raising a custom message. No external data inputs or outputs are processed or manipulated. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected, and the structure appears standard for modular Python packages. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation are present. The use of dynamic import is controlled and limited to predefined module names.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for lazy importing of package submodules, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It serves its purpose securely and appropriately.",
