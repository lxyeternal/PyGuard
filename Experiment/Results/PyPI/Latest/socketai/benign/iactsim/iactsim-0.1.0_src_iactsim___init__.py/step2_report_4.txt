  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard Python package setup that uses `__getattr__` and `__dir__` for lazy loading of submodules.\n- They highlight the import of core modules (`utils`, `_version`) and version management.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is identified.\n- The only noted potential concern is the dynamic import via `importlib.import_module`, which, if misused, could pose risks if attribute names are externally controlled. However, in this context, the attribute names are predefined and controlled within the package.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code matches the description: it performs lazy loading of modules, handles import errors, and exposes attributes dynamically. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as standard, with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and security risks mostly at 0 or very low (0.2). These seem reasonable given the code.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):**  \n  None of the reports justify a risk score above 0.2. The only potential concern is the dynamic import, but it's controlled via a predefined list of submodules, mitigating risks.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or execute malicious payloads. The dynamic import is controlled, and no suspicious patterns are observed. Malware score should remain 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  No claims are based solely on assumptions; the analysis is cautious and based on code structure.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The code is a typical implementation for a Python package with lazy loading.\n- No backdoors, malware, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The only slight concern is the dynamic import pattern, but it's safely constrained.\n\n### Final estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal risk due to dynamic import, but well-controlled)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured package loader with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The current scores are appropriate, but I would suggest:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to dynamic import, but controlled)\n\nThis reflects a very low security risk, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores but note that the controlled nature of dynamic imports keeps the risk minimal.
