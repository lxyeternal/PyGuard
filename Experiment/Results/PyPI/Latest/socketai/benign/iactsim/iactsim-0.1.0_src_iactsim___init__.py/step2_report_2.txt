  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code's purpose—lazy loading, version handling.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correct.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately notes the use of __getattr__ for lazy loading, no suspicious code, and no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9 (slightly high but justified as a cautious estimate).  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly conservative but reasonable; no actual malicious activity detected.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the controlled use of dynamic import, no signs of malicious intent, and notes the potential minimal security risk due to dynamic import control.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (appropriate).  \n- **Assessment:** Reasonable and consistent.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly identifies the standard package setup, no malicious behavior, and controlled dynamic import.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 (appropriate).  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the standard pattern, no malicious activity, and safe dynamic import.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. I agree with the malware score of 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; scores are 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Risk Score:** The highest risk score is 0.9 in Report 2, justified as a cautious estimate given the dynamic import pattern, but overall, the code is quite safe. A more conservative estimate for the entire code would be around 0.1-0.2, mainly due to the use of dynamic import mechanisms which, if misused, could pose risks.  \n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to dynamic import flexibility, but no actual issues)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured Python package loader implementing lazy imports with proper error handling. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are evident. The reported scores are reasonable, with only slight conservatism in some cases.",
