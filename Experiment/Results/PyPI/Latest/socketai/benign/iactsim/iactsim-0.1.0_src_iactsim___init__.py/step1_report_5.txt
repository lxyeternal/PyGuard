{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package structure with lazy import mechanisms for submodules, managing import errors, and exposing certain attributes and modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'importlib', import of 'utils' and '_version' from 'iactsim', and the try-except block for handling import errors.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the dynamic import of submodules and main modules via importlib.import_module, which could potentially execute untrusted code if the module names or imports are manipulated, but in this context, they are static and controlled.",
  "flows": "Initial import of core modules -> on attribute access (__getattr__), dynamic import of modules -> access of module attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ for lazy loading is standard; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident. No external network or file operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with licensing comments and imports 'importlib'. It attempts to import 'utils' and '_version' from 'iactsim', raising a custom error if import fails, which is standard for package setup. It defines a list of submodules and a main mapping. The __dir__ function returns all submodules and main modules for introspection. __getattr__ dynamically imports submodules or main modules based on attribute name. There are no user input reads, network calls, or data leaks. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The use of dynamic import is controlled and predictable.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard Python package lazy-loading mechanism with error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be well-structured, secure, and appropriate for its purpose.",
