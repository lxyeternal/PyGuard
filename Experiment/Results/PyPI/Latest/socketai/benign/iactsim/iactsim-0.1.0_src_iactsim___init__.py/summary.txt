  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The controlled dynamic import pattern is standard and safe. The initial risk scores of 0 are appropriate; a minimal risk score (~0.1) could be considered if external influence on attribute names is a concern, but in typical use, it poses no threat."
