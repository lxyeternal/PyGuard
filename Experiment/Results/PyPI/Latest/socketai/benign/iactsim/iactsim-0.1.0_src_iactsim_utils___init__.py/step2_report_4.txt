  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of the issues in the code:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code snippet consists solely of license headers and import statements from internal modules, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. The code appears benign and standard for a scientific Python package.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \nThe reports are consistent and thorough, correctly noting the absence of suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. They correctly interpret the code as a standard module setup with no security concerns.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, readable import statements.  \n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious behavior or code.  \n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \nSince all reports assign zero to malware and security risk, and the code is simply import statements with licensing comments, there is no justification for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**  \nThe code does not perform any suspicious activity, code injection, or malicious behavior. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly stating that the code is part of a larger package and that no malicious activity is visible in this fragment.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \nThe scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risk evident.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code snippet is a standard, benign part of an open-source scientific package. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores; no changes necessary. The code is safe and does not pose any security threat based on this fragment.",
