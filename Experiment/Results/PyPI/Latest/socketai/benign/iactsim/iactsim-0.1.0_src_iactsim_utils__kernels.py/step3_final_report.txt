  "purpose": "Utility functions for wrapping CUDA RawKernel objects with custom docstrings and converting Doxygen-style comments in CUDA source code to NumPy-style docstrings, facilitating documentation and kernel management.",
  "sources": "String parsing of CUDA source code, function parameters, and comments; no external untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Generated wrapped functions and docstrings; no external data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Parsing source code strings, extracting documentation and parameters, wrapping kernel functions with generated docstrings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; regex parsing is standard for documentation processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs string manipulations, regex-based parsing, and function wrapping, all of which are typical for documentation utilities. No external network, file, or system activity is present. The regex patterns and string operations are straightforward and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is well-structured and serves a benign purpose, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The conservative security risk scores (~0.1) reflect cautiousness but are justified given the potential for misuse if untrusted data is passed, which is a standard consideration in such utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for CUDA kernel documentation and wrapping, with no malicious activity or security risks detected. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
