  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility for wrapping CUDA kernels and converting documentation; no external data sources or malicious activities are detected.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The code is well-structured and purely documentation/utility-focused.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, securityRisk = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, confidence = 1.0 — these are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. No suspicious patterns or malicious code are present.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed. The scores and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on string parsing and documentation conversion. No external or untrusted data sources involved.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. Regex parsing is standard and safe here.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0, confidence = 0.9 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The analysis correctly identifies the benign nature of the code. The low confidence (0.9) is reasonable given the cautious approach.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for wrapping and documentation conversion, with no external untrusted data or malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malware or malicious intent. The code uses standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, obfuscated = 0, confidence = 0.95 — acceptable.\n- **Justification:** The slightly non-zero securityRisk score (0.1) might reflect a cautious stance on dynamic code wrapping, but overall, the code is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no change necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; utility for wrapping and documentation conversion.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. String manipulations and regex are standard.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, obfuscated = 0, confidence = 0.9 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The low securityRisk score reflects cautiousness but aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others; no external data or malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, code injection, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0, confidence = 1 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward utility code.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports possibly due to the dynamic wrapping and regex parsing, but these are standard practices and do not pose real security risks here.\n- **Confidence Levels:** Appropriately high, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n\n**Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to dynamic code wrapping, but no actual risk.\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a utility for documentation and kernel wrapping, with no external data handling, network activity, or malicious payloads. The regex parsing is standard for source code documentation processing and does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No significant modifications to scores or reasoning are necessary.",
