{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for wrapping CuPy RawKernel objects, converting Doxygen-style documentation to NumPy-style docstrings, and retrieving kernels from a module.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (cuda_source, function_name, raw_kernel, docstring, module, kernel_name) and internal string manipulations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects. No external network or system command execution is present.",
  "flows": "The main flow involves converting documentation from source code strings to formatted docstrings, wrapping kernel functions, and retrieving kernel functions from a module.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code practices, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code performs standard string processing, regex matching, and function wrapping without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules (re, functools, textwrap) and defines functions for string manipulation and code documentation conversion. The core functions are 'wrap_cupy_rawkernel', 'clean', 'convert_doxygen_to_numpy', and 'get_kernel'. No external system calls, network operations, or file I/O are present. The regex patterns for parsing code and documentation are used solely for extracting and formatting docstrings. There is no indication of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. The code is designed for documentation and wrapper generation purposes, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility code for kernel wrapping and documentation conversion with no signs of malicious intent. It performs string processing, function wrapping, and code parsing in a typical manner, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
