{
  "purpose": "A benchmarking utility class for timing and managing performance measurements of code sections, with internal data handling and display functions.",
  "sources": "Internal method calls, standard libraries (numpy, tabulate, IPython.display), local modules (_is_notebook). No external untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Display functions (HTML display, console print), internal data structures. No external network or file system interactions.",
  "flows": "Internal data flows from timing measurements to storage and display; no untrusted data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected. Code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a performance benchmarking utility that records timing data, computes statistics, and displays results either in notebooks or console. It does not read untrusted input, execute external code, or perform network activities. The logic is consistent, and no obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the provided reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or near-zero) align with the benign nature of the code. No modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard benchmarking utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
