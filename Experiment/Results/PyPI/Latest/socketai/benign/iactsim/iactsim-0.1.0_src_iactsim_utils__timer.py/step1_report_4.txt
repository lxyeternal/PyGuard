{
  "purpose": "This code defines a BenchmarkTimer class for timing and managing benchmark results, including adding sections, entries, and displaying summarized timing data.",
  "sources": "Imports from tabulate, numpy, IPython.display, and a local module ._is_notebook. The code reads data from method parameters and internal state, specifically self.results.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; display and print functions output formatted data locally. No network or file system access is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters (e.g., add_entry, print_results) into internal storage (self.results), then into display functions for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code does not perform any suspicious actions such as network communication, system modifications, or data exfiltration. All functions are standard for timing and display purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a benchmarking utility with methods for timing code sections and displaying results in HTML or console formats. It uses standard imports and local modules without suspicious or obfuscated code. No malicious behavior, malicious patterns, or suspicious data handling are evident. The code operates entirely within its intended scope of performance measurement and visualization, with no network activity or external data leaks. The code structure and content appear legitimate and standard for such utility classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard benchmarking utility class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code, malware, or suspicious data flows. All functionality is within expected behavior for performance measurement tools.",
