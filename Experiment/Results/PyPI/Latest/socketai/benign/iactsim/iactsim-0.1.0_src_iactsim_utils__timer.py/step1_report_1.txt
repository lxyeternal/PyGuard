{
  "purpose": "The code implements a benchmarking utility class for timing and organizing performance measurements, with methods for adding sections, recording entries, computing totals, and displaying results in HTML or console formats.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the class methods such as add_entry, get_results, and internal calculations. No external or untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data via display(HTML()) for notebooks and print statements for console. It does not send data over network, write to files, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs (add_entry, results dictionary) through internal calculations (_calculate_totals, _prepare_data) to output functions (print_results). No untrusted data sources influence the flow significantly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code appears standard for performance benchmarking.",
  "analysis": "The code is a self-contained benchmarking utility class with no external data ingestion beyond method parameters. It does not include any network activity, system modifications, or obfuscated code. No suspicious code patterns, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are detected. The only operations are timing measurements, data organization, and display formatting, all of which are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign performance measurement utility with no malicious behavior. It performs standard timing and display tasks without external communication or harmful actions. The code appears safe and trustworthy.",
