  "purpose": "Determine if the current environment is a Jupyter Notebook.",
  "sources": "Import of IPython.get_ipython() and access to __class__.__name__",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Source: get_ipython() function; Flow: retrieving shell class name to decide environment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward environment check with standard IPython API usage",
  "analysis": "The function attempts to detect if the code runs inside a Jupyter Notebook by importing IPython and checking the class name of get_ipython(). The use of try-except handles import errors or NameError gracefully. No untrusted input handling, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior detected. The code relies on standard IPython API and does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical environment detection utility with no malicious intent or security risks.",
