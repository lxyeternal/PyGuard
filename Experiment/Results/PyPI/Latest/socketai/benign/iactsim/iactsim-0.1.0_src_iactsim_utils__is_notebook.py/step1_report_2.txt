  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leakage or system effects; solely environment detection.",
  "flows": "Import and call get_ipython() -> check the class name -> return boolean.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard environment detection pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a popular library (IPython) to identify if it is executing within a Jupyter Notebook. It handles exceptions properly, avoiding crashes if IPython is not available. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious logic present. The code only performs environment detection without any side effects or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely intended for environment detection. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
