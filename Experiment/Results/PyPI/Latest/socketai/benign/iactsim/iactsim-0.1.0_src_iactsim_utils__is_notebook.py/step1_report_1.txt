  "flows": "Import and attribute access to identify environment type, no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; standard environment detection code.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to detect if it's running inside a Jupyter Notebook by importing 'get_ipython' and checking the class name. This is a common, benign environment check. The try-except block gracefully handles import errors or missing definitions, defaulting to False. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment detection utility with no malicious intent or security issues.",
