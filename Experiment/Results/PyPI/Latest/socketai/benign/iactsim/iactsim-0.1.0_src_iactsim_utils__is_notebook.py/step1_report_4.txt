  "purpose": "Determine if the code is running inside a Jupyter Notebook environment.",
  "sources": "Importing IPython module and calling get_ipython() to check the runtime environment.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads environment and module information without writing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "get_ipython() (source) -> checking __class__.__name__ (sink) to identify environment type.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs a standard environment check with typical Python practices.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import IPython's get_ipython function and then checks its __class__.__name__ attribute to determine if the environment is a Jupyter Notebook. It handles exceptions gracefully, returning False if import fails or if get_ipython() is not defined. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The function is straightforward and well-structured for its purpose, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for environment detection, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
