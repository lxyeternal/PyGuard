  "purpose": "Detects if the code is running inside a Jupyter Notebook environment by inspecting IPython shell class name.",
  "sources": "Importing get_ipython() from IPython, calling get_ipython().__class__.__name__",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Source: get_ipython() call; Sink: class name comparison to 'ZMQInteractiveShell'",
  "anomalies": "Standard environment detection logic; no anomalies or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports get_ipython() to check if running in a Jupyter Notebook. It inspects the class name of the shell object, returning True if 'ZMQInteractiveShell', otherwise False. Exception handling ensures robustness if IPython is unavailable. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and widely used for environment detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard environment detection utility with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its purpose and benign nature. Scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent.",
