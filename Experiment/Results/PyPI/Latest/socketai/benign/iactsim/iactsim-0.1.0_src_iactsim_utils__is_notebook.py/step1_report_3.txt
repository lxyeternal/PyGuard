  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard environment detection logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to detect Jupyter Notebook execution environment by importing IPython's get_ipython() and checking the class name of the shell. It uses standard practices for environment detection with appropriate exception handling. No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no code injection are present. The code performs a benign check and returns a boolean result, typical for environment awareness in notebooks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment check function with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected.",
