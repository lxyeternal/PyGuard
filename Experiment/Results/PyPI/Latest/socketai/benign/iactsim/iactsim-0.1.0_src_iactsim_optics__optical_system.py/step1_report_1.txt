{
  "purpose": "Define an OpticalSystem class for managing optical surface objects, their properties, and representations for visualization and analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements (from typing and tabulate), class constructor (__init__), surface addition/removal methods, property accessors, and internal data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly designed for handling untrusted input; methods primarily manipulate internal data structures. No external data processing or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No external source-to-sink data flow; data flows are internal within the class for managing surfaces and representations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The code is well-structured, standard Python, with no dynamic code execution or external input handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing optical surface objects, with methods for adding, removing, and accessing these objects. The constructor checks for duplicate names and ensures that at least one sensitive surface exists. The methods handle internal data structures securely without external data or command execution. No external input handling, network communication, or execution of arbitrary code is present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured Python class for managing optical surfaces within a larger optical system application. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code snippet.",
