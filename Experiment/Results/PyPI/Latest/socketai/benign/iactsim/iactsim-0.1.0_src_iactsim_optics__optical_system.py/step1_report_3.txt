{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for managing an optical system composed of surfaces, including methods to add, remove, and access surfaces, as well as to display system information.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'surfaces' list during initialization and from method parameters such as 'surface' in add_surface and remove_surface methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that handle untrusted input directly, nor are there network, file, or system command executions that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('surfaces', 'surface' for add/remove) into internal data structures (_surfaces, _surface_map). The class methods manipulate these structures but do not process untrusted external data in a way that leads to security risks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and mainly manages data structures and displays information. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured and appears to be a standard implementation of a surface management class for an optical system. It handles adding, removing, and accessing surfaces, with error handling for duplicate names and invalid keys. The class uses type hints, docstrings, and leverages standard Python practices. There are no network calls, file manipulations, or dynamic code execution. The only potential concern might be the usage of the tabulate library for display, but it is a benign library for formatting output, not a source of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious implementation of an optical system manager. It does not contain any malicious behaviors or security risks. It primarily manages internal data structures for optical surfaces without handling untrusted external data in a dangerous way.",
