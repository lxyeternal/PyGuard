{
  "purpose": "The code defines an OpticalSystem class for managing a collection of optical surfaces in a simulation or modeling context.",
  "sources": "The code reads surface objects passed into the constructor, as well as surface attributes like name, type, position, and materials within each surface object.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks; the code primarily manipulates Surface objects and outputs tabulated data for display or debugging.",
  "flows": "Surface objects are added or removed via add_surface and remove_surface methods; surface data is accessed via __getitem__, and the surface map is used for lookup. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks with potential exploitation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs standard collection management with safety checks, such as avoiding duplicate surface names and ensuring at least one sensitive surface exists.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class for managing a list of Surface objects, with methods for adding, removing, and accessing surfaces by name or index. It enforces unique surface names, maintains a mapping for quick lookup, and includes validation to ensure at least one sensitive surface exists. The code uses standard Python collections and does not execute any external commands or process untrusted input. No data leakage, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors are evident. The code appears well-structured for its purpose, with appropriate error handling and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a standard, well-structured Python class for managing optical surfaces. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs typical data management and presentation tasks without any suspicious behaviors.",
