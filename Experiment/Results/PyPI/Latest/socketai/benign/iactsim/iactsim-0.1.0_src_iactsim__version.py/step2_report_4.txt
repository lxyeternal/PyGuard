  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, auto-generated boilerplate for version management.\n- No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or dynamic behaviors are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are identified.\n- The code is consistent across reports, with no contradictions or suspicious claims.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The version strings are hardcoded and assigned directly, with no external data flows.\n- The conditional type-checking block is standard practice and not malicious.\n- The reports' assessments of benignity are accurate.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score: all reports correctly assign 0, reflecting no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score: all reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Risk score: all reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no changes needed.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis is sound.\n- The code is standard boilerplate, with no security concerns.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No modifications or re-evaluations are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, safe version definition module generated by setuptools-scm, with no malicious or security-related issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.",
