  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version module for a Python package.\n- It assigns static version strings and tuples.\n- It includes a conditional block for type checking, which is a common pattern.\n- There are no dynamic data flows, external inputs, or suspicious constructs.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are present.\n- The code's purpose is solely to define version metadata.\n\n**Review of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and generated boilerplate.\n- They correctly identify that there are no untrusted data sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors.\n- The analysis notes the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty about benignity.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, auto-generated code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since there are no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- The code is standard boilerplate, and no issues are evident.\n- The reports do not claim or imply any vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or obfuscation.\n- The code is generated by setuptools-scm, a well-known tool, and contains no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe, benign, and serves a standard purpose.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, auto-generated version module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The provided reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
