  "purpose": "Define version metadata for a Python package, including version string and tuple.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static code with no data sinks.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated version module for a Python package. It assigns static version strings and tuples, with a conditional block for type checking. There are no dynamic data flows, external inputs, or suspicious patterns. The code is clear, straightforward, and contains no obfuscation or malicious behavior. All reports agree on its benign nature, with high confidence (1). The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and serves a standard purpose of version metadata. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and overall risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
