  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, type checking block",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment only",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; simple version assignment and type hinting",
  "analysis": "The code establishes version variables (__version__, version, etc.) with static values and type hints. There are no input sources, external data, or dynamic code execution. The code comments clarify it is auto-generated by setuptools-scm and should not be modified. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, static version definition for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
