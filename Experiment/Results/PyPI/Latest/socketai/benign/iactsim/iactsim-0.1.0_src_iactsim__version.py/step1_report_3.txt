{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, including version strings and tuples, generated by setuptools-scm for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, hardcoded version values, import statements within TYPE_CHECKING block.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; all assignments are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and standard for version handling.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables using static values, with a conditional import block that only executes during type checking. There are no dynamic inputs, external data reads, or code execution paths that could be malicious. The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate for versioning purposes, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign version information module generated by setuptools-scm. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks and serves only to define package version metadata.",
