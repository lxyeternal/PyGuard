  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment of version data to variables; no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version-related variables for a package. It imports type hints conditionally and assigns static version strings and tuples. There are no external inputs, no data manipulation, or security-sensitive operations. The code explicitly states it's generated by setuptools-scm and does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or malicious actions. No obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for version definition and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears standard and safe.",
