{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, intended for use in package management and version tracking.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and tuples assigned directly within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignments are used.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from external sources to sinks; version information is statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no obfuscation, and no dynamic execution or hidden behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining version variables for the package. It includes a conditional type-checking block but does not execute any untrusted or external data processing. The version info is hardcoded, which is standard practice, and there are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The presence of type-checking constructs suggests adherence to good coding practices, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving purely as a version descriptor for a Python package. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
