  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and auto-generated boilerplate for version management.\n- No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- The code uses standard patterns for type hinting and version assignment.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The version strings and tuples are hardcoded, which is typical for such files.\n\n**Specific Review of the Reports:**\n\n- **Reports 1-5:** They all conclude the code is benign, with confidence level 1, and assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. They correctly identify the code as standard boilerplate generated by setuptools-scm, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Code Confirmation:**\n\n- The code provided matches exactly with the described boilerplate. There are no hidden behaviors, no external data handling, and no dynamic code execution. The conditional type-checking block is standard practice.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n\n- No logical errors or flaws are present in the code.\n- The report's reasoning is sound; it correctly dismisses any suspicion of malicious intent.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all assessments are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — The code is static, benign, and auto-generated. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — Given the above, the overall security risk is negligible.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n- Since the code is auto-generated boilerplate, it is unlikely to be malicious or obfuscated intentionally.\n- No need to increase risk or malware scores based on assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, static version information module generated by setuptools-scm. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive elements. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and overall security risk.",
