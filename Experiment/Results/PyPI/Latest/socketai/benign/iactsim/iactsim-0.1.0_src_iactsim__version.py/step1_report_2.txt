{
  "purpose": "This code defines version-related metadata for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm for version management.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded version strings and assigns them to variables. It also conditionally imports typing modules during type checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs are used, and no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the version information is static.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. It uses standard patterns for version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily boilerplate generated by setuptools-scm, assigning static version information to variables and types. The conditional typing import is standard for static type checking. No external data, user input, or untrusted sources are involved. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns; it is straightforward and intended solely for version management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, solely managing version metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard boilerplate and does not contain any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
