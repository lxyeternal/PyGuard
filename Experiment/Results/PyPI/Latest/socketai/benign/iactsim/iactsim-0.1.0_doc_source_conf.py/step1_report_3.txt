{
  "purpose": "This script is a configuration file for setting up Sphinx documentation for the 'iactsim' project.",
  "sources": "Import statements (import pathlib, sys, re, iactsim), sys.path modification, print statements, re.match for version parsing.",
  "sinks": "Print statements could output internal information to the console, but are harmless in this context. No untrusted input handling or external data transmission is present.",
  "flows": "Import and exception handling flow; version parsing flow; configuration setup flow. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of print statements for diagnostic output; no use of insecure functions, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script that sets up project info, extensions, and theme options. It handles module import errors gracefully, modifies sys.path if needed, and logs a message. No malicious behavior, malware, or security issues are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical configuration file for documentation purposes with no malicious intent or security threats. The print statements are benign and likely used for debugging during development.",
