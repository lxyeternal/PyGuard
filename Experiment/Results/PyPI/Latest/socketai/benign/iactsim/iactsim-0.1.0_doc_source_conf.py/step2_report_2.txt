  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code contains import statements, license comments, project info, extension setup, and path adjustments. No untrusted data handling, network activity, or malicious logic detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on import logic and version extraction. No malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code imports 'iactsim', handles import errors, adjusts sys.path, and extracts version info via regex. No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights print statements and import handling.\n- **Assessment:** The print statements ('################## Installed', 'Inside') are benign debug logs. The code handles imports and version parsing normally.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — the risk score is slightly elevated due to print statements, but these are harmless debug logs.\n- **Justification:** The risk score of 0.1 is reasonable given the benign print statements, which could be considered minor information disclosures during debugging.\n- **Conclusion:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing import, sys.path modification, and version extraction.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; standard configuration code with debug print statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on import statements, sys.path modifications, and version extraction.\n- **Assessment:** All behaviors are typical for a documentation setup script. The print statements are benign debug info.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely configuration and import handling.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated (0.1) in Report 3 due to debug print statements, which is reasonable. All other reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor information disclosure via print statements, which is acceptable in debug contexts.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script for documentation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The minor risk score in one report is justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep the risk score at 0.1 for the print statements, and malware/obfuscated scores at 0.\n\n---",
