  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation setup, including import handling, version extraction, and extension configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.path modifications, version regex parsing, print statements for debugging.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Import and version parsing flow, with benign print statements for debugging.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of benign print statements used for debugging; no malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script involving module imports, path adjustments, version extraction, and extension setup. The print statements are typical debug logs and do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious data flows, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration script with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor risk score of 0.1 in one report due to debug print statements is justified. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
