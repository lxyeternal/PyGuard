  "purpose": "Build and evaluate a CNN-based classifier for MNIST dataset images.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflow.keras, sklearn, matplotlib; data loading via mnist.load_data()",
  "sinks": "model.predict(), model.evaluate(), plt.show()",
  "flows": "Data loaded from MNIST dataset -> preprocessed -> passed into model training -> predictions -> confusion matrix and classification report",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. All code appears standard for machine learning tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries for deep learning and visualization, loads the MNIST dataset, normalizes and reshapes data, builds a CNN model, trains it, and evaluates performance with confusion matrix and classification report. No unusual or malicious activities detected. Usage of standard APIs and functions aligns with typical ML workflows. No hidden or obfuscated code, no network connections, no data leaks or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of a CNN classifier for MNIST dataset without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard ML tasks with legitimate library functions. No anomalies or malware indications present.",
