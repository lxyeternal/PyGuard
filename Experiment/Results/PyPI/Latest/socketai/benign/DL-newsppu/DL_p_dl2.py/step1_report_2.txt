{
  "purpose": "The code builds, trains, and evaluates a CNN model for classifying MNIST digits using TensorFlow/Keras.",
  "sources": "Data loading from tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist, user-defined model and training routines, and visualization with matplotlib.",
  "sinks": "Model prediction output, confusion matrix display, and evaluation functions, which handle data but do not transmit or store untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "Input data (MNIST dataset) flows through normalization, reshaping, model inference, and evaluation steps, ending in visualizations and printed metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of standard datasets and libraries, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script loads MNIST data, normalizes and reshapes it, then defines a CNN model with standard layers. It compiles and trains the model, then evaluates and visualizes results using confusion matrix and classification report. All components are consistent with typical ML workflows; no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No external data transmission, backdoors, or covert channels are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a CNN classifier for MNIST with no indications of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. It employs standard libraries and methods, with no suspicious or malicious actions identified.",
