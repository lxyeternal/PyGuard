  "purpose": "Build and evaluate a CNN classifier for MNIST dataset, including data preprocessing, model definition, training, and performance evaluation.",
  "sources": "Loading MNIST dataset via tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()",
  "sinks": "Model training, prediction, visualization, and evaluation outputs; no external data transmission or data leakage observed",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading, through preprocessing, into model training, then to prediction and evaluation steps",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard CNN pipeline for MNIST classification using well-known libraries. It loads trusted data, performs typical preprocessing, defines a common CNN architecture, trains for 5 epochs, and evaluates with confusion matrix and classification report. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activities are present. The code is straightforward, readable, and uses standard practices. No network activity or data exfiltration is involved. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, standard ML code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a CNN classifier on MNIST with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
