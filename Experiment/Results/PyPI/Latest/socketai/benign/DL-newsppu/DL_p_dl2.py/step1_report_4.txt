{
  "purpose": "The code builds, trains, and evaluates a CNN classifier for MNIST dataset.",
  "sources": "Uses datasets from tensorflow.keras.datasets (mnist.load_data()), reads model configurations, and processes input data.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include plots (matplotlib), print statements for accuracy, and classification reports.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading to normalization, reshaping, model training, prediction, and evaluation outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. Uses standard libraries; no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image classification tasks with well-known libraries and methods. No unusual code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior observed. It simply loads data, preprocesses, defines a CNN, trains, evaluates, and visualizes results. No hidden or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical machine learning pipeline for image classification with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
