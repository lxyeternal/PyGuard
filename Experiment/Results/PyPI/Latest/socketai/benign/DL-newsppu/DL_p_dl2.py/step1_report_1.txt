{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to build, train, and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier on the MNIST dataset for digit recognition.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the MNIST dataset via tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data(). No other external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Model training, prediction, and visualization functions (model.fit, model.predict, plt.show, print statements) process and display data; no data leakage or external data transmission occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading to preprocessing, then through model training, prediction, and evaluation, all within local runtime environment. No external network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code performs standard ML tasks with common libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code loads the MNIST dataset, performs normalization and reshaping, constructs a typical CNN model with convolutional and dense layers, trains it, and evaluates using confusion matrix and classification report. All steps follow standard procedures for ML workflows. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious data handling is present. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a CNN classifier for MNIST with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical data processing, model training, and evaluation steps without suspicious behavior.",
