{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the MNIST dataset via tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data() and loads necessary modules from TensorFlow and scikit-learn.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a confusion matrix plot, model evaluation metrics, and a classification report to the console and a plot window.",
  "flows": "The data is loaded and pre-processed (normalized, reshaped, encoded), then fed into the CNN model for training. After training, the model predicts labels for test data, which are then used to generate evaluation metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are detected. All operations are typical for machine learning workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data loading, normalization, model building, training, and evaluation for a CNN on MNIST. It uses common libraries (TensorFlow, scikit-learn, matplotlib) with no indications of malicious behavior. No suspicious or malicious code such as network communications, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical implementation of a CNN classifier for MNIST. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and appears entirely benign and appropriate for machine learning purposes.",
