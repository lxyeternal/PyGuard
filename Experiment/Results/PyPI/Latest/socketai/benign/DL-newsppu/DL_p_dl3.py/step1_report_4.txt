{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load an IMDB dataset, preprocess it, build and train an LSTM model for sentiment analysis, evaluate its performance, and visualize results.",
  "sources": "The dataset is loaded via tf.keras.datasets.imdb.load_data, which retrieves data directly from TensorFlow's dataset API; no other external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "Model predictions are generated and printed; visualizations are displayed using matplotlib; no untrusted data output or external communication is observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading into preprocessing, then into model training, evaluation, and visualization steps; predictions flow from model.predict to output and visualization functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for ML workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical sentiment analysis pipeline using TensorFlow's IMDB dataset, including data loading, padding, model building with Embedding and LSTM layers, training with validation, and visualization of results. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. It uses standard libraries and functions with appropriate parameters. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard machine learning workflow for sentiment analysis using an LSTM model; there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
