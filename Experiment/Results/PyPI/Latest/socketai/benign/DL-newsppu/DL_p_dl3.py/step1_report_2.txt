{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset using an LSTM-based neural network model in TensorFlow/Keras, including training, evaluation, and visualization of results.",
  "sources": "Data is loaded directly from the TensorFlow/Keras datasets module (imdb.load_data). The only user input or external data interaction is the dataset download, which is a standard operation.",
  "sinks": "Model training and evaluation functions are used with data processed in-memory. No external data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present, apart from printing evaluation metrics and plotting results.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading (source) through preprocessing (padding), into model training and evaluation (sinks). The predictions are made and reported, but no data leaks or malicious flows are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments are present. All library usages are standard for machine learning workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical machine learning pipeline using TensorFlow/Keras for text classification. It loads a standard dataset, processes it, builds an LSTM model, trains for 5 epochs, evaluates on test data, and visualizes the results. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network communication to suspicious servers, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of dataset loading, model training, and plotting are common in legitimate ML workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward implementation of a sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow. It does not contain malicious code or suspicious behavior. The data sources, processing steps, and outputs are typical for this kind of machine learning task.",
