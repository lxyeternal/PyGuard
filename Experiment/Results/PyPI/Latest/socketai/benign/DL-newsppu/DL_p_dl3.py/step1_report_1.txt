{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to build, train, evaluate, and visualize an LSTM model for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflow, matplotlib, and sklearn; dataset loading from tf.keras.datasets.imdb; user input is not explicitly handled but data is loaded from external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Model training and evaluation, prediction generation, printing classification report, displaying confusion matrix and plots.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from tensorflow dataset, processed, fed into the model, predictions are generated and visualized; no untrusted external data input or output flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Usage of standard libraries and dataset loading procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical machine learning workflow: data loading, preprocessing, model construction, training, evaluation, and visualization. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices observed. No external network connections or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. It appears to be a standard implementation of sentiment analysis with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an LSTM model for sentiment analysis on a publicly available dataset. It contains no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The overall security risk score is low, and the confidence in this assessment is high.",
