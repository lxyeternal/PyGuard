{
  "purpose": "Standard sentiment analysis using TensorFlow's IMDB dataset with an LSTM model for prediction and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Dataset loaded via tf.keras.datasets.imdb.load_data() from TensorFlow/Keras, no external untrusted inputs.",
  "sinks": "Model training, evaluation outputs, visualizations, and print statements.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, to visualization without external network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of sentiment analysis with standard libraries and practices. It loads the dataset from a trusted source, preprocesses data, builds an LSTM model, trains, evaluates, and visualizes results. No external network activity, code injection, or obfuscation present. The dataset download is from TensorFlow's official datasets, which is standard and safe. No suspicious patterns or malicious code segments identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the scores assigned in the original reports are appropriate, with the security risk score ideally being 0. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.",
