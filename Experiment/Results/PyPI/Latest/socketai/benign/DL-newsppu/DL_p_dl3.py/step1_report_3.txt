  "purpose": "Build and evaluate an LSTM-based sentiment analysis model using the IMDB dataset for predicting sentiment from product reviews.",
  "sources": "Dataset loading from tf.keras.datasets.imdb, model training and evaluation, plotting functions",
  "sinks": "Model prediction outputs, print statements, plotting functions",
  "flows": "Dataset loading -> Data preprocessing -> Model training -> Evaluation -> Prediction -> Visualization",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious functions observed; code appears standard for machine learning workflow.",
  "analysis": "The code loads the IMDB dataset, preprocesses text data, constructs a standard LSTM model with embedding, trains for 5 epochs, evaluates performance, and visualizes results. No input from untrusted sources, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution or network activity. It employs common libraries and functions typical for sentiment analysis tasks. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for sentiment analysis using TensorFlow and Keras with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and solely intended for model development and evaluation.",
