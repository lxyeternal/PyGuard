{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to build, train, evaluate, and visualize a sentiment analysis model using an LSTM neural network on the IMDB dataset for movie reviews.",
  "sources": "Code loads dataset via tf.keras.datasets.imdb.load_data; no external inputs are taken during execution.",
  "sinks": "Model training, evaluation, and visualization functions; no data leakage, file writing, or network connections observed.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded, preprocessed, fed into the model for training, then evaluated and visualized; no untrusted data flows to external sinks or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard for ML workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for ML and visualization, loads a well-known dataset, preprocesses data with padding, constructs an LSTM-based neural network, compiles it, trains over 5 epochs, evaluates on test data, and generates visualizations. All steps are typical ML procedures with no suspicious behavior, no external network calls beyond dataset download, and no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate machine learning implementation for sentiment analysis. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or sabotage. It is a standard example script for deep learning with Keras.",
