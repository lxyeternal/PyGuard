  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard data analysis and modeling script, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- The code reads from 'USA_Housing.csv' and performs typical EDA and linear regression modeling.\n- No external or untrusted data sources, network activity, or secret handling is present.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation or hidden code.\n- The security risk scores are low or zero, which is consistent with the absence of security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** The code functions as intended for a typical data science task. No issues or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors, security flaws, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate, no malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.\n  - Security risk: 0 or very low — no evident security concerns.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The reasoning is sound; no assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities that aren't supported by the code.\n- The evaluation metrics and visualization steps are standard.\n- The data source is local CSV, with no external data fetching or sensitive data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The current scores seem appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Higher risk scores:** Not justified; the code is purely analytical.\n- **Malware concern:** None, as no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** Minimal, given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**My assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk detected.\n\n**Rationale:** The code performs standard data analysis tasks with no suspicious elements, external communications, or malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical data science script with no security issues. The current scoring reflects this accurately.",
