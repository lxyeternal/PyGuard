{
  "purpose": "The code performs exploratory data analysis and builds a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features from a dataset.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the CSV file 'USA_Housing.csv'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; all outputs are visualizations and printed metrics based on internal dataset.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from the CSV, processed, and used for modeling and visualization; no external data flow or untrusted input handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no network communication or data exfiltration activities observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard data analysis libraries, reads a CSV file, performs data exploration with plots, splits data into training and test sets, trains a linear regression model, and evaluates its performance. All operations are typical of a data science pipeline. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. There are no external communications, no handling of sensitive data beyond the dataset, and no obfuscated or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data analysis and modeling script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any malware or malicious behaviors, nor does it pose any security threat. The overall security risk is very low.",
