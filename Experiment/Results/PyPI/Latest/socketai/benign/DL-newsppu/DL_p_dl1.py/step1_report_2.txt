  "purpose": "The code performs exploratory data analysis and linear regression modeling on a housing dataset to predict house prices.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the file 'USA_Housing.csv' using pandas.read_csv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include print statements, plot displays, and model coefficients; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input into pandas DataFrame, then through analysis and modeling steps, with predictions compared to actual values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "The script loads housing data, performs visualization and correlation analysis, splits data into training and test sets, trains a linear regression model, and evaluates the model with metrics and plots. All operations are standard for data science workflows and do not involve suspicious activity or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data analysis and machine learning script for housing price prediction. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks are present.",
