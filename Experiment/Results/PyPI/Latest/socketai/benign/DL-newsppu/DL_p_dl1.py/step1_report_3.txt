  "purpose": "This script performs exploratory data analysis and linear regression modeling on a housing dataset for house price prediction.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'USA_Housing.csv' using pd.read_csv.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs model coefficients, prediction scatter plots, and error metrics; no untrusted data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Data is read from CSV -> used for analysis and modeling -> predictions are generated and visualized.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a dataset, performs EDA with visualizations, trains a linear regression model, and evaluates its performance. It uses standard Python libraries and follows typical data science workflows. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data analysis and modeling script with no malicious intent. It securely handles data for analysis purposes, with no signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks.",
