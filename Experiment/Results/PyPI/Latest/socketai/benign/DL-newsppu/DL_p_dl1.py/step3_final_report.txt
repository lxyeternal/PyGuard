  "purpose": "Perform exploratory data analysis and train a linear regression model on housing data for price prediction.",
  "sources": "Reading 'USA_Housing.csv' dataset from local storage.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration points detected.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from CSV -> analyzed via visualizations and correlations -> split into train/test -> model trained -> predictions made -> evaluation metrics computed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data analysis and modeling tasks without any malicious or obfuscated elements. It reads a CSV file, visualizes data, trains a linear regression model, and evaluates it. No external network calls, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical data science workflows. No anomalies or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
