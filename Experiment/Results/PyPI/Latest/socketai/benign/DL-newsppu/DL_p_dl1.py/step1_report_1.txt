  "purpose": "The code performs exploratory data analysis and linear regression modeling on a housing dataset to predict house prices.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'USA_Housing.csv' using pandas.read_csv()",
  "sinks": "Uses sklearn for model training and prediction; outputs include printed model intercept, evaluation metrics, and plots",
  "flows": "Data is read from CSV -> analyzed with pandas and seaborn -> split into train/test -> trained with sklearn LinearRegression -> predictions generated and evaluated",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard data analysis and modeling tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a CSV dataset, performs visual exploratory analysis, trains a linear regression model, and evaluates its performance. No external or untrusted input sources are used beyond the dataset file. No suspicious or malicious actions, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection, are present. The code strictly follows standard data science procedures without hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data analysis and modeling script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads a dataset, performs analysis, trains a model, and outputs results as expected. No anomalies, malware, or security issues detected.",
