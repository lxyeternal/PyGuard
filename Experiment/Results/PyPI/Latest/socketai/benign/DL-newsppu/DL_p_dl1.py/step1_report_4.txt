{
  "purpose": "The code performs exploratory data analysis and linear regression modeling on a housing dataset for price prediction.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the file 'USA_Housing.csv' using pd.read_csv(). No other external or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sensitive data outputs, no network connections, and no external system commands are present. The code only generates visualizations and prints model parameters.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the CSV file into a DataFrame, then into model training and prediction steps, with results displayed via plots and print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears standard for data analysis and modeling.",
  "analysis": "The script loads housing data, performs EDA with plots, splits data into training and test sets, trains a linear regression model, and evaluates it. All operations are typical for a data science workflow. No malicious patterns, such as network activity, system modifications, or secret handling, are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data analysis and regression modeling script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs data loading, visualization, model training, and evaluation in a straightforward manner.",
