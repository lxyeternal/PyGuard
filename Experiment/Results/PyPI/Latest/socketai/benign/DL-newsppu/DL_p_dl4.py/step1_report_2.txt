{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform image classification on a rice dataset using a convolutional neural network (CNN). It involves dataset preparation, model creation, training, and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset files from local directories (Rice_dataset/Rice_Image_Dataset), loads images via ImageDataGenerator, and processes image files for training, validation, and testing.",
  "sinks": "Predictions are made with the model, and evaluation outputs include confusion matrix and classification report. No data is transmitted externally or saved maliciously.",
  "flows": "Dataset files are loaded and processed into training, validation, and test sets; data flows from filesystem into data generators, then into the CNN model for training and prediction; evaluation results are generated locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code follows standard deep learning workflow; all library usage is typical for such tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dataset splitting, image data loading, CNN model construction, training with early stopping, and evaluation via confusion matrix and classification report. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident. It operates solely on local data files, uses standard libraries, and does not include any suspicious network activity or hidden code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical deep learning implementation for image classification without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It adheres to expected practices for such tasks and contains no malware indicators.",
