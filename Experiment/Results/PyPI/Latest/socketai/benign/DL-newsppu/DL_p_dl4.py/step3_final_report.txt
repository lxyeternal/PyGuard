{
  "purpose": "Standard image classification pipeline using CNN on local dataset with data splitting, model training, and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Local dataset directories, file system operations for train/validation split, dataset URL for reference.",
  "sinks": "Model training and evaluation; no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reading dataset files -> Data generator feeding into CNN model -> Model predictions -> Evaluation metrics.",
  "anomalies": "File moving operations for validation set creation; no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical deep learning tasks: data loading, splitting, CNN training, and evaluation. No network activity beyond local file handling. No obfuscated or malicious code segments are present. Dataset URL is public, and data handling practices are standard. File operations are typical in data preparation and do not indicate malicious intent. The code is clear, straightforward, and uses common libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard image classification pipeline with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0, reflecting its safe and typical nature.",
