{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to download, preprocess, train, and evaluate a CNN model for rice image classification using a dataset from Kaggle.",
  "sources": "Paths to dataset directories, dataset download link, file operations for dataset splitting, and image data generators.",
  "sinks": "Model training and prediction steps, particularly the predict method on test data, and visualization functions.",
  "flows": "Dataset splitting -> Data generation -> Model training -> Model prediction -> Confusion matrix and classification report generation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code operations observed. No hardcoded credentials or hidden code. The dataset link is public, and no network activity beyond dataset handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The code handles dataset preparation by splitting training data into validation sets, sets up image data generators for training, validation, and testing. It constructs a CNN model, compiles, and trains it with early stopping. Finally, it predicts on test data and visualizes results via confusion matrix and classification report. All operations are standard for image classification tasks. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious code behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The only external resource is a publicly available Kaggle dataset, and there are no network operations apart from file handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a CNN for image classification with no detectable malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It is a standard data science script for training and evaluating an image classifier. No malicious or sabotage code is present.",
