{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to download, preprocess, and train a CNN model for rice image classification, including data splitting, model training, and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from directories (dataset files), loads images via ImageDataGenerator, and reads class labels and files from local file system.",
  "sinks": "Uses model.predict for inference, displays a confusion matrix, and prints classification reports.",
  "flows": "Loads image data from local directories → preprocesses data → trains CNN → predicts on test data → generates evaluation metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Uses common libraries and typical data processing steps. No obfuscated code or unusual logic. No hidden or malicious commands.",
  "analysis": "The script loads image data from local directories specified in 'Rice_dataset'. It creates a validation split by moving files from training directories. Uses standard image processing and deep learning libraries (TensorFlow, Keras). Implements a typical CNN with dropout for regularization. The code performs model training, early stopping, and evaluation through confusion matrix and classification report. No external network connections, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious code constructs are present. The only potential concern is the use of local file operations for dataset management, which is standard in training scripts and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign image classification pipeline without malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious activities. It is a typical deep learning training script, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
