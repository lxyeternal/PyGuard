  "purpose": "The code performs sentiment analysis on text data from a dataset and graph structures, including training, saving models, performing sentiment analysis, and visualizing data with network graphs.",
  "sources": "Loads IMDB dataset using keras.datasets.imdb.load_data; reads text attributes from graph nodes; loads model and tokenizer from local files; loads Universal Sentence Encoder from TensorFlow Hub.",
  "sinks": "Saving models and tokenizers to local files; loading models and tokenizers from local files; downloading embedding model from TensorFlow Hub.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset load to preprocessing, training, saving models/tokenizers, loading them later for prediction on node texts, then embedding generation and similarity calculation, propagating sentiments, and visualization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle for tokenizer deserialization (potential risk if file is tampered); loading of Universal Sentence Encoder from TensorFlow Hub (external dependency). No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns identified. No code injection, data leakage, or system harm evident.",
  "analysis": "The code loads IMDB dataset, preprocesses text, trains an LSTM-based sentiment analysis model, and saves both the model and tokenizer locally. It then defines functions for applying the model to graph nodes' texts, adding similarity-based edges via embeddings from TensorFlow Hub, propagating sentiments through neighbors, and visualizing the graph. All operations are standard machine learning workflows and visualization routines, with external dependencies on well-known libraries and models. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, malicious network activity, or harmful system modifications are present. The use of pickle is a potential risk if files are compromised but is a common practice for serialization. External resource downloads are controlled and not suspicious. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate data analysis and visualization pipeline with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical machine learning and graph analysis tasks without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It includes model training, saving/loading, inference, and visualization, all using standard libraries and practices. No indicators of malware or security risks are detected.",
