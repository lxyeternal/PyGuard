{
  "purpose": "The code performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews, trains a neural network model, saves it, and applies sentiment analysis and similarity-based graph analysis on textual data within a graph structure, including visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the IMDB dataset, loads and saves models and tokenizers from/to files, reads node attributes ('text') from a graph, loads a TensorFlow model and a pickled tokenizer.",
  "sinks": "Uses the loaded model to generate predictions, attaches sentiments to graph nodes, and visualizes data. No output or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Reads text data from dataset and graph nodes, preprocesses with tokenizer, passes through ML model for prediction, updates graph with sentiments, computes embeddings, and adds edges based on similarity. No external data exfiltration detected.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes standard sentiment analysis pipeline; no unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic code execution. Use of third-party libraries (TensorFlow, Keras, networkx, etc.) appears legitimate. The only potential concern is the embedding load from TensorFlow Hub, which is standard for NLP tasks but could be a vector for external communication if misused—however, in this context, it is used locally. No backdoors, hidden code, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script trains and saves a sentiment analysis model, then loads the model and tokenizer to perform analysis on graph nodes with 'text' attributes. It uses TensorFlow Hub for embedding generation, which is a common NLP practice. The code does not include any data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. The model and tokenizer are saved and loaded locally. The use of external libraries and online resources is typical for this domain. No obfuscation or malicious code segments identified. The overall logic appears consistent with legitimate NLP and graph analysis tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sentiment analysis pipeline with graph-based text similarity and sentiment propagation. No malicious behavior or sabotage observed. It performs expected tasks securely, with no signs of malware, data leakage, or sabotage. The only consideration is the use of external embeddings, which is standard practice but should be monitored in high-security contexts.",
