  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "eval() usage, network connections, hardcoded secrets, data handling, environment variables, input/output points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, eval/exec calls, environment variable access, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., eval input, network data) to sinks (network, file, eval), indicating potential malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (base64, eval), network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, misleading filenames, dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation with base64 encoding, uses eval() with untrusted input, establishes network connections to suspicious domains, and writes data to misleading filenames. These are classic indicators of malicious activity. The high obfuscation (0.7), malware (0.75), and security risk (0.8) scores are justified by these behaviors. Other reports lack such indicators, with scores reflecting benign or non-suspicious code. The overall assessment confirms that Report 1's indicators warrant high maliciousness, while others are low risk. The confidence score (0.8) is appropriate given the evidence. No false positives or unnecessary warnings are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code in Report 1 demonstrates significant malicious indicators, including obfuscation, dynamic execution, and suspicious network activity, justifying high malware and security risk scores. Other reports are consistent with benign code. The overall security posture is moderate, with the primary concern centered on the code described in Report 1.",
