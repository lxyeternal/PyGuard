{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or computation with some external data inputs, but without more context, the specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or imported modules that accept external parameters or files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls that could send data externally, or use of exec/eval for code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network or file system, possibly via intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials or API keys are absent; however, any use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution functions without sanitization is suspicious. Unusual variable naming or code complexity might suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain obvious malicious imports or functions. It uses standard Python structures. No hardcoded secrets are visible. No network or system modifications are evident. Absence of eval/exec reduces risk. The structure indicates typical data handling without suspicious loops or conditions. Without obfuscation or hidden code, the code seems benign but incomplete for full certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard data processing script. Due to limited context, low confidence is assigned, and no malicious intent is detected.",
