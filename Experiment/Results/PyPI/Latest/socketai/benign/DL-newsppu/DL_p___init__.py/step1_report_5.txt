{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility for performing calculations or data processing, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from function parameters, user input via input() functions, or external files read through open().",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing to console, writing to files, or sending data over network connections if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or files through processing functions, possibly ending at outputs like print statements or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features identified. No use of eval or exec observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving standard Python constructs. It reads inputs, processes data, and outputs results without any suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or insecure practices identified. The absence of network activity, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution reduces suspicion. Given the limited scope, it appears to be a benign utility script.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on its content. It seems to be a normal data processing script with no indicators of supply chain attack vectors or malicious intent.",
