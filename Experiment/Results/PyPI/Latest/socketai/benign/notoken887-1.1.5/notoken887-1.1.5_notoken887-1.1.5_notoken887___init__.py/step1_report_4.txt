  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without additional context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the standard input (e.g., input() function) and possibly from environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to the console via print() and possibly sent over the network through socket connections or external API calls.",
  "flows": "Input is read from user/environment, processed internally, and then output or transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Unusual patterns such as dynamic code execution or hidden network connections are not present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python functions for input and output. No suspicious imports or behaviors were identified. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code structure is straightforward and does not include obfuscated or intentionally misleading elements.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to perform routine data handling without malicious intent.",
