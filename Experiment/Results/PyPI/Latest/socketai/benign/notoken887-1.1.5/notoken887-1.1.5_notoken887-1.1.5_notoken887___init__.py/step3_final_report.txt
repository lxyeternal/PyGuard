  "purpose": "Analysis of Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on supply chain threats and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, user input, network/file operations, dynamic code execution functions (`eval`, `exec`), data reads from stdin, environment, files.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system modifications, system commands via `eval`/`exec`, data exfiltration points, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input flow into `eval`/`exec` or network/file operations, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `eval`/`exec` with untrusted data, absence of obfuscation, no suspicious network activity detected, no hardcoded credentials, no backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs routine data handling with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The notable exception is the use of `eval`/`exec` with untrusted input, which is a significant red flag indicating potential malicious intent. The other reports align with benign behavior, but the presence of dynamic code execution elevates the risk. Scores assigned reflect these observations: low malware and security risk for benign scripts, but a higher score (0.6) for code involving `eval`/`exec` with untrusted data. The overall assessment confirms that the risk is primarily driven by dynamic code execution patterns, which could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, with low malware and obfuscation scores. The exception is code using `eval`/`exec` with untrusted input, which justifies a malware score of 0.6 and a security risk of 0.7. The scores are consistent with the observed patterns, and no further adjustments are necessary.",
