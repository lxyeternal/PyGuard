  "purpose": "A simple reversible token obfuscation utility that prepends 'ENC#' and reverses the token for 'encryption', and reverses the process for 'decryption'.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'token' in encrypt(), input parameter 'encrypted_token' in decrypt()",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks, network calls, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "encrypt() takes 'token' -> reverses and adds prefix -> output; decrypt() takes 'encrypted_token' -> removes prefix -> reverses -> output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string manipulation, minimal obfuscation, no malicious code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code performs a trivial reversible string operation: reversing the token and adding a fixed prefix during encryption, then removing the prefix and reversing again during decryption. No external data sinks, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. The logic is consistent and correct. The obfuscation is minimal and easily reversible, not cryptographically secure. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent are detected. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity. The security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting the insecurity of the scheme but no active threat. The obfuscated score is also low (~0.1), indicating minimal obfuscation. The overall assessment aligns with the reports' conclusions, which correctly identify the code as trivial, insecure, and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic reversible obfuscation utility with no malicious intent or malicious code. The reports' scores and reasoning are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
