  "purpose": "Simple reversible token encryption and decryption class",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'token' and 'encrypted_token' in 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output encrypted or decrypted tokens, no external data sinks or network operations",
  "flows": "Token input -> encryption (reversal + prefix) -> output; encrypted token -> decryption (remove prefix + reverse) -> output",
  "anomalies": "Uses a predictable, reversible transformation that provides no real security; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The class provides basic token reversal with a prefix 'ENC#'. The 'encrypt' method reverses the token and adds a prefix; 'decrypt' removes the prefix and reverses again. This offers no cryptographic security and is easily reversible by anyone with knowledge of the method. No external data access, no obfuscated code, no malicious behavior observed. The implementation is simplistic and insecure as a cryptographic mechanism but does not contain malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs trivial reversible encoding rather than secure encryption. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is insecure for actual cryptographic purposes but does not pose a security threat in the context of malicious code.",
