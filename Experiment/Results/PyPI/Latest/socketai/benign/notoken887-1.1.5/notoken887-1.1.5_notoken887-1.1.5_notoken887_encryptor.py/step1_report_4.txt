  "purpose": "A simple class for reversible token obfuscation using string reversal and a prefix.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'token' in encrypt method, input parameter 'encrypted_token' in decrypt method.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output the transformed token, potential data leaks if tokens are sensitive.",
  "flows": "encrypt method takes 'token' -> reverses and adds prefix -> returns encrypted string; decrypt method takes 'encrypted_token' -> removes prefix -> reverses -> returns original token.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a fixed prefix 'ENC#' that does not prevent reverse engineering; simple reversible obfuscation without cryptographic security; no validation or integrity checks; no hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The class provides basic reversible transformation of tokens via string reversal. The 'encrypt' method reverses the token and prepends 'ENC#', while 'decrypt' removes the prefix and reverses again to recover the original token. This is a naive obfuscation, not secure encryption. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No suspicious code patterns, such as network calls, file manipulations, or credential handling, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a trivial reversible obfuscation mechanism without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not provide real security but may serve as a basic placeholder or low-security obfuscation. There are no indications of malware or malicious activity.",
