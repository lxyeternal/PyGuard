{
  "purpose": "Simple token obfuscation through reversible string manipulation",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'token' in encrypt() and 'encrypted_token' in decrypt() methods",
  "sinks": "Return statements of both methods, no external data output or storage",
  "flows": "Input 'token' → encrypt() → return obfuscated token; encrypted_token → decrypt() → return original token",
  "anomalies": "Uses reversible string slicing for encryption, which is not secure; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The class provides a trivial reversible obfuscation method, prefixing tokens with 'ENC#' and reversing their string. The decrypt method correctly reverses this process. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code does not perform any harmful operations or external communications. Its security model is weak as a cryptographic method but does not constitute malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a simple reversible obfuscation that is not secure for sensitive data but does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. No malware or security threats are present.",
