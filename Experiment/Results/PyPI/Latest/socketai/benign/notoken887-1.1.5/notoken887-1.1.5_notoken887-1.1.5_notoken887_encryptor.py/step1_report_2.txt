{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple reversible encryption and decryption of tokens using string reversal and a prefix.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'token' in encrypt method; input parameter 'encrypted_token' in decrypt method",
  "sinks": "Return statements in both methods (outputting processed data); no external sinks or network calls",
  "flows": "Input 'token' -> encrypt() -> returns encrypted string; Input 'encrypted_token' -> decrypt() -> returns original token",
  "anomalies": "Uses trivial reversible encryption, which offers no real security; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscation or malicious intent apparent",
  "analysis": "The class implements a simplistic method for 'encrypting' and 'decrypting' tokens by reversing strings and adding/removing a prefix 'ENC#'. The encryption method is easily reversible and provides no cryptographic security. No external dependencies, no network operations, no hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code appears to be a toy or placeholder for more robust security, not malicious. No anomalies or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic reversible string manipulation for tokens without any malicious intent. It does not pose security risks or malicious behaviors. The simplicity suggests it is not secure but not malicious.",
