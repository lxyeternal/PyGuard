{
  "purpose": "A simple class providing basic reversible encryption and decryption of tokens, likely for obfuscation or lightweight security purposes.",
  "sources": "The methods 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' accept input parameters 'token' and 'encrypted_token', respectively.",
  "sinks": "The 'encrypt' method returns an obfuscated string; 'decrypt' reads from the 'encrypted_token' input. No external data sinks or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "The 'encrypt' method reverses the token and prepends 'ENC#'. The 'decrypt' method strips the first 4 characters and reverses the remaining string to recover the original token.",
  "anomalies": "The encryption scheme is a simple string reversal with a prefix, which is insecure and easily reversible. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a minimal reversible obfuscation for tokens, not genuine encryption. It does not handle or transmit data externally, nor does it include suspicious or malicious code. The logic is straightforward and limited to string manipulation. The lack of cryptographic security indicates it's not intended for sensitive data protection. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs trivial reversible obfuscation of tokens without malicious intent or security risk. It is a simple utility, not a malicious or security-compromising implementation.",
