  "purpose": "This setup.py script defines package metadata for distribution, with no dynamic or malicious code.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields: name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious contact email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') as unprofessional metadata anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setuptools setup script with static metadata. No dynamic code, input handling, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The anomalies are limited to contact info and URL, which are unprofessional but do not constitute malicious behavior. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as 0. The security risk score is slightly elevated (~0.1-0.2) due to metadata anomalies but not due to code vulnerabilities. The overall code is benign, with metadata concerns not affecting code security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only issues are unprofessional contact details and URL, which do not pose security threats. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0; the security risk score should remain low (~0.1-0.2). The package appears benign, but metadata anomalies warrant caution in trustworthiness.",
