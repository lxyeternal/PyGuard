  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for a Python library called 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; static setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data sinks; no potential for data leaks or malicious effect.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and website ('https://thugging.org'), which are unprofessional and potentially malicious or offensive. No code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script configuring package metadata. It contains straightforward package info with no dynamic or suspicious code. The email and URL are unusual and may be intentionally provocative or malicious, but they do not indicate malicious code or behavior within this script itself. No sources or sinks for malicious data, no anomalies in code structure, and no embedded malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with unprofessional contact details but no malicious or security-threatening code present. The main concern is the suspicious contact info, not the code logic itself.",
