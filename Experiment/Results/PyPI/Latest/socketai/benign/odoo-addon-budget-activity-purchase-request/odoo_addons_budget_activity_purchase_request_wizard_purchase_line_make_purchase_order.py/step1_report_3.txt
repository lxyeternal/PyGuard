  "purpose": "Enhancing the purchase request to purchase order process by adding activity_id information.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'item.line_id.activity_id.id' during method calls.",
  "sinks": "Data stored in 'vals' for purchase order lines and in search domain list 'order_line_data'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'item.line_id.activity_id.id' into 'vals' and 'order_line_data' via method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, straightforward method overrides.",
  "analysis": "The code extends existing Odoo models to include 'activity_id' information during purchase order line creation and search. It uses standard API calls, leverages superclass methods, and appends activity-related data. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The usage of data appears consistent with normal business logic, and no unsafe or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard extension of an Odoo module, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It simply propagates activity_id data in purchase order line processing.",
