  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is minimal, consisting solely of a license comment and an import statement (`from . import purchase_request`). There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is benign and standard for Python modules.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that there are no logical flaws or anomalies. The code is straightforward and does not exhibit suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since the code is plain and unobfuscated.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Risk Score Justification:**  \n   Since the code is just an import statement with a license comment, the overall security risk is negligible. The risk scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions or Claims:**  \n   No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all acknowledge the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n- **Risk Score:** **0**\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.**",
