{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a minimal module import with a license comment, likely part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from . import purchase_request' reads local module data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports a local module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module import with a license comment, typical in Python packages. It contains no network activity, data leaks, or malicious code. The minimal structure and standard import suggest benign intent. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
