  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports another module named purchase_request, likely as part of a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a local module named purchase_request",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or external systems are present",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are evident in this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with a license comment; no anomalies detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a license comment and a single import statement for a local module. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. The import of a local module itself is common in Python projects and does not imply malicious behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. Given the limited content, the code is likely safe and part of a standard module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of a license comment and a module import. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
