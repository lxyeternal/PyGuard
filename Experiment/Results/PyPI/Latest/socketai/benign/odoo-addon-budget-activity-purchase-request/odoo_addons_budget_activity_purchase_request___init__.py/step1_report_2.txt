{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module import statement for an application, likely part of a larger project, with no explicit functionality shown.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules 'models' and 'wizard'. No external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or untrusted data handling are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable within this snippet; only static imports are used.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two local modules and specifies an open-source license. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or data manipulations. The minimal structure suggests it is a standard module declaration, not suspicious or malicious. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent. The license declaration at the top is common for open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module import statement with an associated open-source license. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks in this fragment.",
