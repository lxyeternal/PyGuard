{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define the structure of a Python package by importing modules 'models' and 'wizard'. It likely serves as an initializer or entry point for a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package's own modules 'models' and 'wizard' via relative imports.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling points in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present in this minimal code, as it only performs module imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only license information and two relative import statements. No user input, network activity, or data handling occurs. The imports are standard for Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module initializer with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply imports internal modules, serving as part of a larger project. There are no anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
