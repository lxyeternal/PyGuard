  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, considering the code snippet, which is a simple module import with a license comment.\n\n**Code Content Recap:**\n```python\n# License AGPL-3.0 or later (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl).\n\nfrom . import models\nfrom . import wizard\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code only contains import statements for local modules (`models` and `wizard`) and a license comment.\n- There are no signs of data input, data sinks, or dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be a standard part of a larger Python package, likely an __init__.py__ or similar module initializer.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or security issues are evident in this snippet.** The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of the Reports:\n- All reports assign a **malware score of 0**, which is appropriate.\n- The **securityRisk scores** are all 0, aligning with the benign analysis.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- The **confidence levels** are all 1, which seems reasonable given the minimal and clear code.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made beyond the code snippet.\n- No overestimations of risk or malware are present.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- The **risk scores** are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The **malware scores** are all 0, justified by the lack of malicious indicators.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are 0, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- Given the simplicity of the code, **no changes are necessary** to the scores.\n- The reports are consistent with the code content and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Personal Estimation:\nBased on the entire review:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese align with the current assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign module import with a license comment. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Final note:** Always consider context—if this code is part of a larger package, review the entire package for malicious behavior, but based solely on this snippet, the security posture is clear.",
