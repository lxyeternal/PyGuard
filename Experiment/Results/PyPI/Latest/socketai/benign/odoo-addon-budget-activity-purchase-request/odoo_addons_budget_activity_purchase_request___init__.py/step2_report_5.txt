  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements for local modules ('models' and 'wizard') and a license comment.\n   - There are no input sources, data flows, or sinks, and no dynamic or malicious behavior evident.\n   - The code appears to be a standard module initialization or part of a larger package, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly conclude that the code is benign and standard for a Python package.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Malicious Indicators**:\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity.\n   - The license (AGPL-3.0) is open-source and does not imply malicious intent.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions**:\n   - Since the code is minimal, any suspicion would require additional context or code snippets.\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions beyond what is presented.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency & Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the limited code snippet, the risk assessment is appropriately low.\n- If future code snippets introduce dynamic code execution, network activity, or other suspicious patterns, re-evaluation would be necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-founded. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
