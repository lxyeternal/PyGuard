  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of import statements for local modules ('models' and 'wizard') and a license comment.\n   - There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and free of security issues, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - They do not identify any potential issues beyond the minimal import statements.\n   - The assessments seem reasonable given the code snippet's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, indicating certainty in their assessments.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a security risk of 0, there is no need to justify higher risk scores.\n   - The code is clearly benign.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified given the lack of malicious behavior.\n   - No suspicious activity or malicious intent is evident.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No overreach or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the code's minimal and benign nature, there is no need to elevate the scores.\n- If future code includes dynamic behaviors, external data handling, or suspicious patterns, re-evaluation would be necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**. No further action needed.",
