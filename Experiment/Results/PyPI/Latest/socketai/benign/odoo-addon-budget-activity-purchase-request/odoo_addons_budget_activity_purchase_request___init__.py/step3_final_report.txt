  "purpose": "Module initialization with import statements for local modules 'models' and 'wizard' in a package, accompanied by an open-source license comment.",
  "sources": "Import statements for '.models' and '.wizard' modules",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, network activity, or external interactions",
  "flows": "Import statements load local modules; no data flow or untrusted data handling present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and a license comment. It does not perform any data processing, dynamic code execution, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of this snippet. The assessments correctly interpret the code as standard package initialization code with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
