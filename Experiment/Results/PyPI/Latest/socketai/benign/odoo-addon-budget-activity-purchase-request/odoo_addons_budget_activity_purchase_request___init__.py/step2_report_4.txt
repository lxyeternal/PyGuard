  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of license comments and import statements for local modules (`models` and `wizard`).\n   - There are no signs of data flow, external input, dynamic code execution, or any malicious activity.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks or malicious behavior.\n   - They appropriately note the lack of data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n   - No logical errors or overestimations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - Since the code is purely import statements with no suspicious features, these scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - The risk scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of any security concern.\n   - No justification is needed for higher scores because there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - The malware scores are all zero, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it exhibit behavior typical of malware.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted claims about vulnerabilities or malicious activity are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and match the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:\n- The code is a simple, benign module import with an open-source license comment.\n- All reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**My Personal Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the observed code characteristics.\n\n**Final note**: If in the future, more complex code involving dynamic imports, network activity, or data handling appears, these scores should be revisited accordingly.",
