  "purpose": "Import a module named test_budget_activity_purchase_request, likely for testing or functionality extension.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a local module or package.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; just an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns. The import statement is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code includes only a license declaration and a single import statement for a local module. There are no user inputs, network operations, data processing, or other potentially risky behaviors. The import appears to be part of a larger project, possibly for testing purposes. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with a license comment; no malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
