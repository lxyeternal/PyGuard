  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of a license comment and a single import statement.\n   - There are no data flows, network activity, or data processing.\n   - The import is from a local module, likely part of a larger package or for testing purposes.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Activity**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n\n3. **Risk Assessment & Scores**:\n   - The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), indicating strong certainty that the code is safe.\n\n4. **Potential Issues in the Reports**:\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n   - The only minor point is the securityRisk score of 0.1 in report 3, which seems slightly elevated given the absence of any suspicious activity. However, since the code is minimal, this is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed based on the current information.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or security concerns. The scoring aligns well with the analysis, and no changes are necessary.",
