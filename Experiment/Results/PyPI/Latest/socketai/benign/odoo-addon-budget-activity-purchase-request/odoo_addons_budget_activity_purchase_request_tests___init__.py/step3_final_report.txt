  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a module import statement, likely for testing or internal modularization, accompanied by a license comment.",
  "sources": "The import statement from a local module named 'test_budget_activity_purchase_request'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "The code imports a module, but there are no data flows, network activity, or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with a license comment and a single import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a license comment and an import statement for a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The import is typical in testing or modular codebases. No data flows, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The import statement and license comment do not pose any threat. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
