{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'test_budget_activity_purchase_request', likely for testing or development purposes within a larger project.",
  "sources": "The import statement is the primary source of data input, loading code from an internal module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or security issues, as there are no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows, input handling, or processing occurring in this code snippet beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; it does not contain any hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The presence of an import statement with a license comment is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "This code only includes a license declaration and a single import statement. It appears to be part of a larger module or package, possibly for testing purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, external network activity, or data exfiltration. The simplicity and lack of active code reduce the likelihood of malicious intent. The import is from a relative module, typical for internal testing or development modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving likely as a test import within a project, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
