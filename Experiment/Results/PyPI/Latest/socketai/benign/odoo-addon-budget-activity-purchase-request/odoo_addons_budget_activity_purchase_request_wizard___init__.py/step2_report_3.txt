  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code content, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, benign import statement with a license comment.\n- No evidence of data flow, input/output handling, or malicious activity.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is just a license comment and an import statement; no issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Malware presence:** No malware or malicious behavior is indicated.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as there's no logic or data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of scores:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **No change needed.**\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- **No change needed.**\n\n#### Risk Score:\n- All reports assign very low risk scores (0.1 or 0), which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n- The only report with a score of 0.1 justifies it by noting the dependency on external modules, but this is not inherently risky.\n- **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- **Any higher risk scores** would be unjustified, as the code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or contain any suspicious patterns.\n- **Potential assumptions** about the module's content are unfounded here; the import alone does not imply malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if you want to be conservative, but 0 is justified)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent with the code's benign nature. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code snippet is a standard, harmless import statement with a license declaration.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
