{
  "purpose": "Minimal benign import statement within a Python module, likely part of a larger project.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from . import purchase_line_make_purchase_order' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process input or output.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code does not contain data flow or execution paths beyond the import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward license comment and import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment and a relative import from a local module. There are no data processing, network calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The import is standard for modular Python projects. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The minimal nature of the code indicates a benign intent, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with a license declaration, posing no security threat or malicious behavior. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
