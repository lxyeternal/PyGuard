  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and free of malicious behavior, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The main security concern lies in the dynamic SQL construction involving table names, which could be exploited if an attacker can influence or craft malicious table names despite validation. The risk is moderate but manageable with stricter validation. The existing scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis."
