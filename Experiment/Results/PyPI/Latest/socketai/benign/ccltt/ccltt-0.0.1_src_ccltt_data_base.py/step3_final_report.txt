  "purpose": "Provides an in-memory SQLite database management system with functions for creating, retrieving, and deleting nodes and relations, including validation of table names.",
  "sources": "Reads table names for validation; executes SQL queries with parameterized inputs; reads node IDs and names for relations.",
  "sinks": "Uses string formatting for dynamic table names in SQL commands, which could be exploited if table names are manipulated.",
  "flows": "Validation with isidentifier() attempts to sanitize table names; data inputs are parameterized, reducing injection risk; however, table name inclusion via string formatting creates a potential injection point.",
  "anomalies": "Use of f-strings for SQL commands involving table names without additional sanitization beyond isidentifier(); potential risk if table names are influenced by untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard database operations with validation on table names and parameterized queries for data. The primary concern is the dynamic SQL involving table names constructed via string formatting, which, despite validation, can be exploited if an attacker controls or manipulates table names. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present; the code appears straightforward and well-structured. The validation reduces risk but does not fully eliminate it. The use of isidentifier() is a basic safeguard, but more robust validation or whitelisting would improve security. The overall security risk is moderate, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0. The risk score is approximately 0.4, reflecting the potential for injection through dynamic table names, mitigated but not eliminated by validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and free of malicious behavior, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The main security concern lies in the dynamic SQL construction involving table names, which could be exploited if an attacker can influence or craft malicious table names despite validation. The risk is moderate but manageable with stricter validation. The existing scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
