The primary security concern is input validation, which, if addressed, would mitigate potential misuse. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2) due to validation concerns but no active threats."

      "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and free of malicious behavior, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The main security concern lies in the dynamic SQL construction involving table names, which could be exploited if an attacker can influence or craft malicious table names despite validation. The risk is moderate but manageable with stricter validation. The existing scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis."

It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. Overall, the code is safe for supply chain integrity and can be considered free of malicious or security risks."
