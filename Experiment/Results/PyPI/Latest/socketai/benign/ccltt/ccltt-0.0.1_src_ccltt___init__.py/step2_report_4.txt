  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the findings based on the provided code snippet:\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\n# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2025-present Flyshde <zhangyang@outlook.es>\n#\n# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\nfrom .ccl_tt_tree import CclTtTree\n\n__all__ = [\"CclTtTree\"]\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- The code **only** contains license comments, an import statement, and an `__all__` declaration.\n- No data inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution.\n- The import is from a local module (`.ccl_tt_tree`), which is standard for package structure.\n- The license comment indicates a 2025 date, which is in the future relative to the current date (2023). While unusual, it doesn't imply malicious intent.\n- There are **no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities** in this static code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as defining the public interface with license info.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0  \n**Verdict:** Fully consistent, no issues.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; code is benign.\n- **Scores:** all zeros.\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; straightforward, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** all zeros.\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; minimal, standard structure.\n- **Scores:** all zeros.\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** all zeros.\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are any issues present?**  \n  No. The code is a simple module initializer with license comments and a class import. No data handling, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, no malware.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Is the malware score justified?**  \n  Yes, given the code's simplicity, there's no indication of malicious intent.\n\n- **Any assumptions that are questionable?**  \n  The only unusual aspect is the 2025 date in the license comment, but that alone doesn't imply maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (or very close to zero)  \n\nThis code snippet is benign, straightforward, and does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard module export with license comments and a class import, with no malicious or security issues detected.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.",
