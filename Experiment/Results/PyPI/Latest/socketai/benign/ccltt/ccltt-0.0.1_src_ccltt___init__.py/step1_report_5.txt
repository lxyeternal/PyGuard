{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a simple module definition that imports a class and specifies its export for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'CclTtTree' from a local module '.ccl_tt_tree'. No data input or external sources are read directly in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling points in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation. The SPDX comment indicates license and copyright, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of license information, a single import statement, and an __all__ declaration. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity. The license information references a 2025 copyright, which is unusual but not malicious. No external data input, no code execution, and no sensitive data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It merely imports a class and sets the export list. There is no malware or security risk detected.",
