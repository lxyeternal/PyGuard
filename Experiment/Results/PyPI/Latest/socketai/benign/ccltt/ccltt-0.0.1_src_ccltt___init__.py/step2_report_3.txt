  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n\n```python\n# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2025-present Flyshde <zhangyang@outlook.es>\n#\n# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\nfrom .ccl_tt_tree import CclTtTree\n\n__all__ = [\"CclTtTree\"]\n```\n\n- The code contains only a license comment, a single import statement from a local module, and an `__all__` declaration.\n- There are no data flows, no input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no suspicious constructs.\n- The import is static and from a relative module, which is standard in package modules.\n- The license comment's date (2025) is future-dated, which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**Summary of findings:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal, straightforward, and purely structural.\n- No untrusted data, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.\n- The license comment and import statement are standard practices.\n- No anomalies, no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 and malware/security risk scores of 0.\n\n**Logical errors or flaws:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign and serves as a module initializer or API definition.\n- The only unusual aspect is the future-dated copyright year (2025), which is not inherently malicious but might warrant a note for review.\n\n**Scores and justification:**\n\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation present.\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Security risk (0):** Correct, no security issues or vulnerabilities.\n- **Risk score:** The reports give 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n\n- The only questionable point is the future date in the license comment, but this does not constitute a security risk.\n- No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional comments:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is standard boilerplate for a Python package module.\n- No changes needed in the scoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- The only minor note is the future year in the license comment, which is not a security concern.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the actual code content.",
