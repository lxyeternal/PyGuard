{
  "purpose": "Define the module's public interface by importing CclTtTree and include license information.",
  "sources": "The license comment lines and the import statement from .ccl_tt_tree",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the import statement is static and safe",
  "anomalies": "Presence of SPDX license comment is standard; no suspicious or unusual code detected",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a license comment, an import statement, and an __all__ declaration. It does not process or handle any data inputs, does not execute any dynamic code, and simply exports a class from a relative module. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initializer with license comments and a simple import/export statement. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
