  "purpose": "Define the public API for a module by exporting the CclTtTree class.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; imports a class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected; only a standard module definition.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing and copyright comments, followed by a relative import of a class. It then specifies the public API via __all__. There are no dynamic code execution, no reading of external inputs, and no suspicious patterns. The structure is straightforward and standard for a Python package module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, standard module export file with no malicious behavior or security issues. It appears legitimate and purely structural.",
