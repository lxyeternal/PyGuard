{
  "purpose": "Minimal Python module exporting a class from a local module with license comments.",
  "sources": "Static license comments, import from local module (.ccl_tt_tree), __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static import and export only.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future year (2025) in license comment, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module with license info, a static import, and an __all__ declaration. No dynamic code, data processing, or suspicious patterns are present. The license date is future-dated but not malicious. No obfuscation, malware, or security issues are evident. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence scores are high, and the reasoning is consistent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, minimal, and free of malicious or security concerns. The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
