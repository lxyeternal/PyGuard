{
  "purpose": "To define the public interface for a module that exports the CclTtTree class",
  "sources": "Import statement for .ccl_tt_tree module, and the SPDX comment for licensing",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input points or data output to external systems",
  "flows": "None; no data flow paths identified within the code",
  "anomalies": "Presence of SPDX license comment, which is standard; no unusual code constructs or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a license comment, an import statement, and an __all__ declaration. It appears to be a module definition that exposes CclTtTree. No suspicious or malicious code, no external data handling, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. The license comment and import are standard practices. The import of a local module indicates reliance on other parts of the package, but nothing suspicious is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves to define the public API of the module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks within this snippet.",
