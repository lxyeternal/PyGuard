  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of the code and its nature:**\n   - The code is a minimal Python module that includes only license comments, an import statement, and an `__all__` declaration.\n   - It does not process any data, execute dynamic code, or perform any operations beyond exporting a class from a local module.\n\n2. **Evaluation of potential security issues:**\n   - No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.\n   - No data flows from external sources to outputs.\n   - The import is static and local, with no indication of malicious behavior.\n   - The license comment is standard, although referencing a future year (2025) is unusual but not malicious.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs are detected.\n\n3. **Assessment of malware risk:**\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious.\n   - No signs of malware or malicious intent are evident.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports aligns with this assessment.\n\n4. **Obfuscation:**\n   - The code is straightforward and clear; no obfuscation detected.\n   - Obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n5. **Security risk:**\n   - Given the simplicity and lack of data handling, the security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Score consistency:**\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature, with confidence scores of 1.\n   - The reasoning and conclusions are consistent.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, minimal module export with license comments.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis reflects the benign and straightforward nature of the code snippet.",
