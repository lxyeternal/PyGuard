  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the details:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as consisting solely of static comments (SPDX license identifiers, copyright notices) and a simple version assignment.\n- No dynamic code, input/output, or data processing is present.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or oversight, not malicious.\n\n**Specific analysis:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirmed: The code is just SPDX comments and a version variable.\n- No issues or malicious behavior.\n- Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. - **Reasonable.**\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Confirmed: Metadata declaration with no executable code.\n- No issues.\n- Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. - **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Confirmed: Static metadata with a future year.\n- No malicious intent, just a possible typo.\n- Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. - **Reasonable.**\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Confirmed: Metadata only, no dynamic or malicious code.\n- No issues.\n- Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. - **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Confirmed: Standard header with no executable code.\n- No issues.\n- Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. - **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as static metadata headers with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk scores:** All are 0, consistent with the benign content.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is not malicious but might be an oversight.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign header with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- Possibly note the future year as a typo but not a security concern.\n\n**Final note:**  \nAll reports are consistent, and the overall security posture of this code snippet is benign.",
