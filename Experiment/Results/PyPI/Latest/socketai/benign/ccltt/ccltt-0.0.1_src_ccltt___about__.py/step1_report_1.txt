  "anomalies": "Presence of SPDX licensing comments is standard; no suspicious code or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains SPDX license identifier comments and a version variable assignment. There are no code execution, data processing, or input/output operations. The comments are standard for open-source licensing and do not indicate malicious intent. The version string is static and not derived from external input.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, benign header indicating licensing and version information. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
