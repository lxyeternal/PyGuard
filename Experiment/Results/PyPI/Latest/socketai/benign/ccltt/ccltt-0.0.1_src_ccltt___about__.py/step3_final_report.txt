  "purpose": "This code serves as a static header containing SPDX license identifiers, copyright notice, and version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only from static comments and a variable assignment (__version__ = \"0.0.1\").",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code contains only static comments and a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the future copyright year \"2025\", which appears to be a typo or oversight but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal static header with no executable logic, input/output, or dynamic code. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The only notable point is the future year, which does not impact security but could be updated for accuracy. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1), given the simplicity and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static header with no malicious or security concerns. All reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. The only minor issue is the future year, which does not affect security but could be corrected. Overall, the code poses no security risk.",
