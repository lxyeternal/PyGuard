  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal header with SPDX license identifiers, copyright, and version assignment.\n- No dynamic code, input/output, or data processing is present.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks is identified.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or oversight, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippets in all reports match the original code provided.\n- The code only contains static comments and a version variable assignment.\n- No code execution, data handling, or external data sources are present.\n\n### Error, Flaw, or Mistake in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n- The only minor point is the future year (2025), which is not malicious but perhaps an oversight.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), justified given the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- The risk scores are correctly low (0), given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n- Malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation techniques are present.\n- Security risk is 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation techniques used)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet. The only potential note is the future copyright year, which could be updated for correctness but does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign header with no security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
