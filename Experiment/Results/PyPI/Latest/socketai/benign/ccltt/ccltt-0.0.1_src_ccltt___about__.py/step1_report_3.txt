{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set metadata information for a Python package or module, including a copyright notice, license identifier, and version number.",
  "sources": "No dynamic input, user input, environment variables, or external data sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points are evident, as there are no functions or operations that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static string values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date, but this alone is not malicious. The SPDX identifiers are standard for license declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal header with license and version information, commonly used in open-source projects. It does not contain any dynamic code, network operations, or potentially malicious constructs. There are no indications of obfuscated or malicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the future year, which could be a typo or deliberate but does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign header for a Python module or package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely an oversight rather than malicious activity.",
