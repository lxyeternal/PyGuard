{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for managing tree-like node structures with operations for adding, copying, deleting, and merging nodes.",
  "sources": "Methods such as get_node_value, get_node_type, add_path, find_by_path_with_wildcard, add_val, add_link, delete_node_and_children, deep_copy; class initializations and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure methods for modifying nodes (add, delete, rename, add_val, add_link), but all actions are within node trees, no external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Operations manipulate nodes within the class; no external data flow or untrusted input directly processed; method calls are internal.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors. No network or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of classes for managing hierarchical node structures with various methods for node manipulation. It relies on external database and tree methods, but no insecure or malicious logic is evident. Operations such as add, delete, rename, or merge are confined to internal data structures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or harmful actions. The design appears to be a standard tree management system with no embedded or hidden malicious functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a typical implementation for managing hierarchical nodes, with no evident supply chain or security risks.",
