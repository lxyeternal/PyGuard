  "purpose": "A placeholder function intended to be executed as a command-line interface entry point.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present as the cli() function is empty and no data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The cli() function is a no-op with no implementation, and there is minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty 'cli' function and includes a main guard that attempts to call this function within a try-except block handling KeyboardInterrupt. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks. The try-except block is standard for graceful termination, but since 'cli()' is empty, there is no operation or data flow. The code appears to be a stub or skeleton for future implementation without any malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal scaffold with no active logic, data handling, or potentially malicious behavior. It appears to be a placeholder for future CLI code, with no security risks or malware present.",
