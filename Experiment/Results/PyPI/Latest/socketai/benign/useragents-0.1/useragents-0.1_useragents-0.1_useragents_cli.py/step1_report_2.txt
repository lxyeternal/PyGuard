{
  "purpose": "Placeholder for command-line interface implementation.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the function 'cli' is empty and does not read any input.",
  "sinks": "No output sinks or data leaks; the code only attempts to call an empty function and handle KeyboardInterrupt.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs since 'cli' is empty and no data processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "The 'cli' function is defined but contains no logic or code. The try-except block only handles KeyboardInterrupt with a debug log statement, which is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty 'cli' function with no implementation, and in the main block, it calls 'cli' inside a try-except that catches KeyboardInterrupt to log a message. There are no sources, sinks, or data flows. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The code appears to be a minimal scaffold for a CLI application with no functionality or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, non-functional scaffold for a command-line tool. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other actions that could be malicious. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
