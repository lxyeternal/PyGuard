  "purpose": "Placeholder CLI function, potentially for future command-line interface implementation.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading sources are present in the current code).",
  "sinks": "None (no data sinks, outputs, or external connections are present).",
  "flows": "No data flow paths exist in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; no suspicious or unusual code structures are present. The try-except block only logs a message upon KeyboardInterrupt but does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a stub function 'cli' with no implementation. In the main block, it attempts to execute 'cli()' inside a try-except block that catches KeyboardInterrupt and logs a debug message. There are no data inputs, outputs, external connections, or code execution paths. The code appears to be a placeholder or scaffold for future CLI logic. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple scaffold with no operational logic, data handling, or external interactions. It poses no security threats or malicious intent based on this snippet.",
