{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a command-line interface (CLI) entry point, but the cli() function is currently empty.",
  "sources": "The only source is the call to the cli() function within the main block.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any operations with potential security implications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks since cli() is empty and no data handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "The cli() function is defined but contains no implementation; the try-except block only handles KeyboardInterrupt with a debug log, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a minimal CLI structure with an empty function, and a main guard that catches KeyboardInterrupt to log a message. No input processing, data handling, or external interactions are present. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The code is extremely minimal and does not perform any operations beyond the basic structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple skeleton for a CLI application with no actual logic implemented. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks present. The code appears to be a placeholder or starting template rather than an active or potentially malicious script.",
