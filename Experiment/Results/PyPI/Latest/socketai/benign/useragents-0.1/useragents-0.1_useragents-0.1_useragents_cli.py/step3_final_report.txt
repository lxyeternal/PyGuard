{
  "purpose": "A minimal placeholder script with an empty CLI function and a main guard that calls it, handling KeyboardInterrupt.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is a stub with no logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of logging.debug without an import statement for logging, indicating incomplete code; no malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty function and calls it within a try-except block for KeyboardInterrupt. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows. The only minor anomaly is the logging statement without an import, which is typical of placeholder code. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, incomplete scaffold with no active logic or security issues. The reports correctly identify its placeholder status and assign appropriate low scores. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score should remain at 0.",
