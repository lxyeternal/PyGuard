  "purpose": "Placeholder function 'cli' intended to serve as a command-line interface entry point",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond calling an empty function and catching KeyboardInterrupt",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an empty 'cli' function; no actual implementation or suspicious activity; logging used but not configured (no import shown), which is suspicious but not conclusive",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty 'cli' function and attempts to execute it within a try-except block that catches KeyboardInterrupt. No data sources, sinks, or flows are present. The use of logging.debug without an import statement suggests incomplete or placeholder code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a scaffold for future implementation. No malicious behavior or security concerns are evident.",
