  "flows": "No data flow; the code only outputs a static message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and contains no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single print statement with no inputs, external calls, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity. Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty in benignity. No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
