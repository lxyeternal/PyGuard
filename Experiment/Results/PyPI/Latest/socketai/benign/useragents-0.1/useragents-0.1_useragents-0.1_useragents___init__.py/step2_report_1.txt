  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple `print` statement outputting a message about installing 'user-agents'. There are no inputs, no external network calls, no data processing, and no obfuscated or suspicious code constructs. The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   - The code does **not** contain any vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n   - No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The message appears to be informational or a prompt, not an active operation.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Confidence Levels**:  \n   - Most reports have high confidence (1), and one has 0.9, which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n\n5. **Any Logical Flaws or Mistakes?**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - No overestimation of risk or malware presence.\n   - No assumptions are made beyond what the code shows.\n\n6. **Potential Changes or Recommendations**:  \n   - The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n   - The conclusion that the code is benign is justified.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0  \n\nThis code is entirely benign, with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects the true nature of the code.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a simple, static print statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All scores are correct, and no changes are necessary.",
