  "purpose": "The code defines custom setup commands that execute benign echo messages during installation or development setup phases.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from static strings within check_call commands executed during setup hooks.",
  "sinks": "The check_call commands invoke shell commands, but only static echo statements, with no untrusted input or data leakage.",
  "flows": "The setup process triggers the run methods of custom commands, which execute check_call with static commands, resulting in output messages.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.check_call with shell=True for static echo commands is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code executes simple, static echo commands during setup via subprocess with shell=True. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The use of shell=True with static commands is unnecessary but not harmful. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. The commands serve as placeholders or notifications, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, executing static echo commands during installation phases. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities. The use of shell=True is unnecessary but not harmful in this context. The current security scores are appropriate and should remain at zero or very low levels.",
