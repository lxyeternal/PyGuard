  "purpose": "Simple command-line calculator that adds two integers provided as arguments",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Outputting the result with print(), which displays on the console",
  "flows": "sys.argv inputs -> int() conversion -> plus() function -> print() output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation or unusual language features",
  "analysis": "The code reads two command-line arguments, converts them to integers, and outputs their sum. It uses standard Python features and does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior. No external data sources or sinks are involved beyond normal input/output. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic addition operation from user-provided inputs with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a simple, benign script suitable for basic arithmetic tasks.",
