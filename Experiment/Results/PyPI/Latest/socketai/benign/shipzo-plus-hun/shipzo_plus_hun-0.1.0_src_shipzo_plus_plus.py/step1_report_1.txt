{
  "purpose": "A simple script that takes two command-line arguments, converts them to integers, and prints their sum.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Uses the arguments in integer conversion and arithmetic operation, then prints the result",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) → conversion to integers → addition in plus() → print output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious behavior or obfuscation; straightforward functionality",
  "analysis": "The script reads two inputs from the command line, converts them to integers, and outputs their sum. No external data sources, network communication, or hidden behaviors are present. The code is simple, clear, and intended for basic arithmetic without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic arithmetic script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs straightforward input processing and output. No signs of supply chain attacks, malware, or suspicious activity are detected.",
