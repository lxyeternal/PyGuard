  "purpose": "A simple Python script that reads two command-line arguments, converts them to integers, adds them, and prints the result.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2]",
  "sinks": "print() function (outputs the sum to stdout)",
  "flows": "sys.argv inputs -> int() conversion -> plus() function -> print() output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing basic arithmetic with no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It relies on command-line input, converts inputs to integers, and outputs their sum. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and transparency are confirmed by multiple reports, all assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified. The code does not handle invalid inputs, but this is a robustness concern, not a security issue. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward calculator with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
