  "purpose": "A simple script to add two integers provided as command-line arguments and print the result.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, then converts first two arguments to integers.",
  "sinks": "Uses print() to output the sum; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) → int conversion → plus() function → print() output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The script takes two command-line arguments, converts them to integers, and outputs their sum. There is no use of external or untrusted sources beyond the command line. No code injection, no network activity, and no data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The logic is simple and secure, with no suspicious or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic calculator for adding two numbers provided via command line. It contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and appears to be intended for legitimate use. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation are detected.",
