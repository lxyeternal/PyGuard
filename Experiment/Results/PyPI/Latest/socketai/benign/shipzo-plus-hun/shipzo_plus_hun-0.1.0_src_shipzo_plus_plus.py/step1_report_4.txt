  "purpose": "A simple script that adds two integers provided as command-line arguments and outputs the result.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Outputs the result via print() to standard output",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1:] -> parse to int -> plus() -> print()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward input processing and output",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to access command-line arguments. It defines a basic addition function plus(a, b). In main(), it extracts arguments from sys.argv, converts them to integers, and prints their sum. No external input beyond command-line args is used. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation observed. The code performs a simple arithmetic operation without any malicious logic or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic calculator script for adding two integers provided as command-line arguments. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is simple, transparent, and safe.",
