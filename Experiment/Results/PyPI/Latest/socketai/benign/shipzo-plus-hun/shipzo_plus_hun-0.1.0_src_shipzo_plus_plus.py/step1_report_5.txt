  "purpose": "A simple script to add two integers provided as command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Uses the inputs to perform an addition operation and prints the result.",
  "flows": "Command-line inputs -> int conversion -> addition -> output via print.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The script takes two command-line arguments, converts them to integers, and outputs their sum. There is no data sanitization beyond int conversion, but no malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward and lacks complex or hidden behaviors. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic calculator for addition without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It functions as intended with no security concerns identified.",
