{
  "purpose": "Start and run a KiWiDB server, with monkey patching for asynchronous I/O.",
  "sources": "Import from kiwidb.server and gevent.monkey, server.run() method, KeyboardInterrupt exception handling.",
  "sinks": "server.run() execution, standard output during shutdown message.",
  "flows": "Import of kiwidb.server -> creation of Server instance -> server.run() method call -> KeyboardInterrupt handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no suspicious input/output handling, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a server module from kiwidb, patches concurrency with gevent, then runs the server, handling shutdown gracefully. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or hidden backdoors. Usage appears to be a typical server start script with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward server launcher script with no malicious intent. It relies on the kiwidb.server.Server class, which is assumed to be a legitimate component. No security risks or malware indicators are evident.",
