  "conclusion": "The code is a typical server startup script with no malicious or suspicious activity. The external dependency 'kiwidb.server' is the primary factor influencing security, but the code itself is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1). No modifications are necessary based on this analysis."
