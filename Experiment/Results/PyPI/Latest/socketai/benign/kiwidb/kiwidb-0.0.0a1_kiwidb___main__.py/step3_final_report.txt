{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and runs a kiwidb server with asynchronous monkey patching, serving as a straightforward server startup script.",
  "sources": "Import from kiwidb.server, application of gevent.monkey.patch_all()",
  "sinks": "server.run() method, which starts the server; no external data inputs or outputs are present",
  "flows": "Import of Server -> monkey.patch_all() -> server creation -> server.run()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard server startup script. It relies on external 'kiwidb.server' implementation, which is not shown, so potential malicious behavior could originate there. The use of gevent's monkey patching is common in asynchronous servers. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident within this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The overall security posture depends on the trustworthiness of the external library, but based solely on this code, it appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical server startup script with no malicious or suspicious activity. The external dependency 'kiwidb.server' is the primary factor influencing security, but the code itself is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1). No modifications are necessary based on this analysis.",
