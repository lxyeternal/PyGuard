{
  "purpose": "Start a server using kiwidb's Server class and handle shutdown on interruption.",
  "sources": "Importing kiwidb.server, importing gevent.monkey, calling server.run()",
  "sinks": "server.run() method (potentially executing server logic), print statement (outputs to console)",
  "flows": "Import kiwidb.server -> instantiate Server -> server.run() -> KeyboardInterrupt handling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious imports beyond standard libraries and known packages, no dynamic code execution, no hidden backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code imports a server class from the kiwidb library, patches all using gevent's monkey patching, and runs the server. The only external interaction is starting the server and handling a keyboard interrupt for graceful shutdown. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network data transmission, credential handling, or obfuscated code. The imported modules are common in network server applications, and no malicious logic is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward server starter script utilizing kiwidb and gevent. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It appears to be legitimate server initialization code with no security concerns based on the provided snippet.",
