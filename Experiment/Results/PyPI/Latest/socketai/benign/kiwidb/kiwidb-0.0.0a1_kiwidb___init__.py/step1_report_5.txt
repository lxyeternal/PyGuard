{
  "purpose": "Export the Client class from the kiwidb.client module, likely for use in other parts of a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'Client' from an external module 'kiwidb.client'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or data leak points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only imports and exports a class without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named 'Client' from the 'kiwidb.client' module and exposes it via __all__. There is no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no data handling, and no suspicious patterns. The simplicity suggests it's a typical module export statement with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
