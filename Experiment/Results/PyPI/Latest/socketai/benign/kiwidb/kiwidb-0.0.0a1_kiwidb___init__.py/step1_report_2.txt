  "purpose": "This code is used to import the Client class from the kiwidb.client module and expose it publicly.",
  "sources": "Import statement from kiwidb.client",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "Import of kiwidb.client to expose Client class; no data flow or untrusted data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import and export statement with no additional logic or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a class from a third-party library (kiwidb) and exposing it via __all__ for external use. No data input, no processing, and no suspicious code behavior are present. The presence of a third-party dependency alone is not suspicious. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and contains no malicious behavior or security issues. It merely exposes a class from an external library.",
