{
  "purpose": "The code exports the Client class from the kiwidb.client module, likely to be used elsewhere for database interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from kiwidb.client",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data; no potential data leak points identified",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data sources to sinks, as the code only imports and exports a class",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns. The __all__ declaration is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external module and defines __all__ to specify exported symbols. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is straightforward and minimal, representing typical module export practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign code that simply re-exports a class for external use. No malicious intent or security concerns are present.",
