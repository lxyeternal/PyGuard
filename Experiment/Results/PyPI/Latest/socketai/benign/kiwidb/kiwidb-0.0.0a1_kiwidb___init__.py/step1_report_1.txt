  "purpose": "This code imports the Client class from the kiwidb.client module and exports it for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module kiwidb.client to import Client.",
  "sinks": "The code exports the Client class for use elsewhere; no untrusted data handling occurs here.",
  "flows": "Imports the kiwidb.client module, then exposes Client via __all__ for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a class and defines the module exports. There are no data inputs, no processing, and no code execution beyond import. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is the origin and trustworthiness of the kiwidb.client module, which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import and export statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is likely safe, assuming the kiwidb.client module itself is trustworthy.",
