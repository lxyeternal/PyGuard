  "purpose": "Export the Client class from the kiwidb.client module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing Client from kiwidb.client.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code only imports and exports a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single class from an external module and then exposes it via __all__. There are no functions, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution. The module appears to serve as an interface or API exposure point. Given its simplicity, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module that re-exports a class from an external package. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation are present based on this minimal snippet.",
