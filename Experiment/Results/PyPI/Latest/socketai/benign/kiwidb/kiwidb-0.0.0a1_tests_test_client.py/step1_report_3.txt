  "sources": "Potential sources include reading environment variables, configuration files, or user input, though none are explicitly visible due to the lack of code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, subprocess calls, file writes, or system commands; no specific sinks are identifiable without code content.",
  "flows": "Without actual code, it's not possible to delineate specific source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are observable due to missing code content.",
  "analysis": "The provided input contains no code to analyze. As a result, I cannot identify sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, or malicious intent. The absence of code precludes any detailed assessment.",
