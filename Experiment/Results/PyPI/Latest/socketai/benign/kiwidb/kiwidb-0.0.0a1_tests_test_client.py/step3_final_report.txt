  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, dynamic code execution points, data collection functions, network communication, obfuscated variable names.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, eval/exec functions, network transmission, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or dynamic code execution lead to data collection or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, dynamic execution, misleading variable names, ambiguous purpose, potential data exfiltration, complex obfuscation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are suspicious but not definitively malicious. No concrete payloads or malicious exfiltration are confirmed. The suspicious patterns justify moderate malware (0.3), obfuscation (0.4), and security risk (0.5) scores. Absence of code in some reports is correctly identified as no risk. Overall, the analysis aligns with the observed patterns, and the scores reflect a cautious stance without overestimating threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution but lacks confirmed malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating a moderate security concern that warrants ongoing monitoring but does not justify outright rejection.",
