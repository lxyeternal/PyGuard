  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that reads environment variables and performs a basic operation, such as printing a value or executing a command.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, potentially user input or external configuration sources.",
  "sinks": "Output functions like print() or system calls, which could expose environment data or execute commands based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> (used in) output or command execution functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads environment variables, which is common in many applications. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code structure is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or malicious intent. Since no malicious behaviors or malicious code patterns are identified, the overall risk appears low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no apparent malicious intent. It performs standard operations involving environment variables and output. No security risks or malware are evident from the provided snippet.",
