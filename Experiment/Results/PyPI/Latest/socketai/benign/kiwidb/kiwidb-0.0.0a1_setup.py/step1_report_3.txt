  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None that directly handle untrusted data; no data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reading the content of README.md during package setup, which is a static operation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools methods to configure package installation. The only file read operation is reading a static README.md file for description purposes. No user input, network activity, or code execution is involved. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are evident. The dependencies listed are common and benign. The overall structure is typical for a setup.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
