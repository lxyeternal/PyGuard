  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'kiwidb' in-memory key-value database Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description, package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is used directly in critical security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data flow to potentially dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file for long description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no untrusted input handling is present. The dependencies are standard and explicitly declared. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior identified. The script appears to be a conventional setup process.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe based on the provided content.",
