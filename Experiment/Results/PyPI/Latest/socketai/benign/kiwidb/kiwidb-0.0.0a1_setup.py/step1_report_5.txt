{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'kiwidb', including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "kills": "No untrusted input, environment variables, or external data sources are used in a way that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves reading the README file to include as the long description during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations with no evidence of malicious code. It imports modules, defines a function to read the README file, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. All operations are typical for a Python package setup script, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or external data fetching that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
