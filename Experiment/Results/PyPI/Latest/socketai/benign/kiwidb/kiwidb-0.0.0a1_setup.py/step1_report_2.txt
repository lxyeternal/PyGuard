{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package called 'kiwidb', a small in-memory key-value database, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "File system access to read 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or external data flow identified.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content flows into the 'long_description' parameter for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic detected. Usage of standard setup functions and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for package setup, reads the 'README.md' for description, and defines package metadata and requirements. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious patterns are present. Dependencies are standard, and the code follows typical Python package setup practices. No anomalies or malicious indicators are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Python package setup script without malicious behavior or security risks. It only performs standard package configuration tasks.",
