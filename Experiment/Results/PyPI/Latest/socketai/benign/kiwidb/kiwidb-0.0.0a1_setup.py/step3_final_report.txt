  "purpose": "Configure package setup with metadata, dependencies, and descriptions for the kiwidb Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static data in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs beyond static file reading.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md as static input; no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools. It reads a static README.md file for the long description and specifies dependencies and metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and confidence of 1. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices justify these assessments. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected or inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate and consistent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
