{
  "purpose": "Configure the setup for the Python package 'kiwidb', including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, gathers package data, and specifies dependencies in the install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external code execution present in the setup script.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content into long_description during setup; dependencies are specified explicitly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code follows standard package setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a function to read the README.md file for description. It then calls setup() with typical parameters for a Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No dynamic code execution, external data manipulation, or hidden behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
