{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exceptions and an error message structure for connection or command handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only class and data structure definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code contains only definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'namedtuple', defines two exception classes ('CommandError', 'Disconnect'), and creates a namedtuple 'Error' with a 'message' field. It is purely definitional, with no data input/output, external interactions, or malicious behavior. The code is standard for error handling in network or command-processing modules. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or security issues are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero, with high confidence, given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, standard setup for error handling, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
