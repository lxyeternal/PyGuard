  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for connection handling and a simple namedtuple for error messages.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines classes and a namedtuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard Python constructs without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'namedtuple' for creating a lightweight, immutable data structure. It defines two custom exception classes, 'CommandError' and 'Disconnect', for control flow in connection handling, which is typical for network or connection-oriented applications. It also creates an 'Error' namedtuple with a 'message' field for error messaging. No input/output, external data handling, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be a straightforward, standard utility module with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and standard, serving as utility definitions for error handling and data structuring. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It is safe and does not contain obfuscation or malware.",
