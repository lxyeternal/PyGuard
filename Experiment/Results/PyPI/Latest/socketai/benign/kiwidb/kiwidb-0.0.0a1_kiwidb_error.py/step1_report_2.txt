{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and a namedtuple for error messaging, likely for a network or command handling module.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read; the code imports a standard library module 'collections'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output mechanisms are present; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines classes and a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'namedtuple' from 'collections', defines two custom exceptions ('CommandError' and 'Disconnect') for signaling errors, and creates a simple 'Error' namedtuple with a 'message' field. All constructs are standard Python features used for error handling and data structure definition. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The code appears to be a standard setup for a network or command processing module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of standard Python class and data structure definitions for exception handling. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
