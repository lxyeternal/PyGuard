  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions and a named tuple for error messaging, likely part of a larger connection or command handling system.",
  "sources": "None; no data input or external data reads are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network operations, or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present, as the code only declares classes and a named tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets detected. Usage of standard library components in a typical manner.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'namedtuple' from 'collections' and defines two exception classes for command errors and disconnections, which are common in network or command-processing applications. It also creates an 'Error' namedtuple with a 'message' field, likely for structured error reporting. No external inputs, outputs, or unusual patterns are present. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to be a simple, safe setup for handling errors in a larger application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues in this snippet.",
