  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step.\n\n**Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The code only imports a standard library component (`namedtuple`) and defines exception classes and a named tuple for error messaging.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources are present, indicating the code is purely definitional.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and minimal.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n- The summaries appropriately reflect the simplicity and safety of the code.\n\n**Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign `malware` and `obfuscated` scores as 0, which is reasonable.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are also 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n- The `confidence` scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n- These scores seem appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- Since all reports conclude no malicious activity, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No issues warrant a higher risk score given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**Malware Score Reflection:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or executing untrusted code.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Challenging Assumptions About Vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as standard and safe.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n**Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: all indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is purely definitional, using standard Python constructs.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- The high confidence and zero scores across malware, obfuscated, and security risk categories are justified.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code snippet is a benign, standard setup for error handling in network or command-processing modules. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring should reflect that with zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
