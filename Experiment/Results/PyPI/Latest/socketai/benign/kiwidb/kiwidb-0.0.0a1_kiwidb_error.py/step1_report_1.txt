{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and a named tuple for error messaging, likely for handling network or command-related errors.",
  "sources": "Import of 'namedtuple' from the 'collections' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines classes and a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library component, defines two custom exceptions for connection management, and creates a simple named tuple. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to serve as foundational error handling setup, with no data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely definitional and contains no malicious activity or security risks. It is standard for network or command processing error handling.",
