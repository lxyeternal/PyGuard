  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class and data structure definitions: two custom exception classes (`CommandError`, `Disconnect`) and a namedtuple (`Error`) with a 'message' field.\n   - No data input/output, external data handling, or network operations are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest scores are for `confidence` (full confidence that the code is benign) and zero for `malware` and `securityRisk`.\n   - Since the code is purely definitional with no malicious activity, the scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No suspicious or malicious behavior is indicated.\n   - Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They acknowledge the code's limited scope and benign nature.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's content.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (since the code is benign and does not introduce security risks)\n\n**Overall Justification:**\nThe code is a standard, straightforward setup for error handling in network or command-processing modules. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The high confidence and zero scores for malware and obfuscation are appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The reports are accurate and well-justified.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- No further action required.",
