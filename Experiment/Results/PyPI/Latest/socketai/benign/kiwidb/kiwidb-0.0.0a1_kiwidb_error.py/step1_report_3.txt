{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and a namedtuple for error messaging, likely for a network or command-handling application.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as no data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; standard Python exception and data structure usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'namedtuple' to create a simple immutable data structure. It defines two custom exceptions, 'CommandError' and 'Disconnect', for handling specific error conditions, which are typical in network or command-processing contexts. The 'Error' namedtuple is used to structure error messages with a 'message' field. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and appears to be a part of larger, standard application logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of standard exception and data structure definitions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
