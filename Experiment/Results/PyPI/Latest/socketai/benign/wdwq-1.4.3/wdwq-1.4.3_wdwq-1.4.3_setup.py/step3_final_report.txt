  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data from setup() parameters, including name, version, packages, install_requires, description, long_description, url, author, author_email, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual URL pointing to a Telegram link (https://t.me/pozozal), which is unconventional for package URLs but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The only notable aspect is the Telegram URL, which is unconventional but not inherently malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2). The scores are consistent with the analysis, reflecting minimal risk primarily due to the URL. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The only concern is the unconventional Telegram URL, which warrants cautious verification but does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified, indicating a very low security risk.",
