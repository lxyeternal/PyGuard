  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n- It defines package metadata: name, version, description, URL, author, dependencies, classifiers, etc.\n- It reads the `README.md` file for the long description.\n- The URL points to a Telegram link (`https://t.me/pozozal`).\n- No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code is a straightforward setup script with no signs of issues.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is syntactically correct and follows standard practices.\n\n- **Scores assigned in reports:**\n  - Malware: 0 in all reports.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 in all reports.\n  - Security risk: Very low (0.1 - 0.2).\n  - Confidence: High (around 0.9 - 1.0).\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review of Each Report:\n\n**1. Report 1**  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1 — reasonable given the benign nature.  \n- **Note:** The Telegram URL is noted as unusual but not malicious.\n\n**2. Report 2**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the code.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2 — reasonable.  \n- **Note:** Same concern about the URL.\n\n**3. Report 3**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**4. Report 4**  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly states the code is benign, with the only anomaly being the Telegram URL.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1 — suitable.\n\n**5. Report 5**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard setup script, no issues.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is accurate. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports, correct since the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), primarily due to the Telegram URL, which is unconventional for package URLs but not malicious.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The URL pointing to Telegram is unconventional for a package's homepage but not inherently malicious. It warrants caution but doesn't elevate the risk significantly.\n- The code reads a local file (`README.md`) without sanitization, but this is typical for setup scripts.\n- No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**1. Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n- Based on the detailed review, I agree with the assigned scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.1-0.2 (due to URL)\n\n**2. Justification for higher scores:**\n- Since there's no malicious activity, malware score remains 0.\n- Obfuscation is absent.\n- The security risk is minimal but slightly elevated due to the Telegram URL, which could be used for malicious purposes if the package is distributed maliciously.\n\n**3. Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script.\n- The only point of concern is the URL, which should be verified for trustworthiness before distribution.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Metric            | Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0      | No malicious code or payload present.                        |\n| Obfuscated        | 0      | Clear, straightforward code.                                |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1-0.2| Due to the Telegram URL, which is unconventional for package URLs but not malicious. |\n\n**Final note:** The overall security posture of this package appears safe. The unusual URL warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent based on the code provided.",
