{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'wdwq' with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data dynamically during execution; it defines static setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only specifies static package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The URL 'https://t.me/pozozal' is a Telegram link, which is unusual for a package URL but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file for packaging a Python project, specifying package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. It does not include any dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The only notable point is the Telegram URL, which is uncommon but not malicious. The code's simplicity and absence of external data processing indicate a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malware or security risks. It appears safe and standard, with no malicious behavior detected.",
