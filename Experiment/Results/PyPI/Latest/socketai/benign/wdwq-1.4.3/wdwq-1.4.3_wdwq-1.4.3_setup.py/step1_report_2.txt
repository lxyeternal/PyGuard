  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'wdwq', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and reads the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file writing, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static strings and package metadata to setup functions; the 'README.md' content is read and passed to long_description.",
  "anomalies": "The 'url' field points to a Telegram link, which is unusual for package URLs, but not inherently malicious. The code reads a file 'README.md' without sanitization, which is typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python module. It imports setuptools, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and reads the long description from a local file. No dynamic code execution, no reading of environment variables, or untrusted input sources are present. The only notable point is the URL pointing to a Telegram link, which is unconventional but not malicious. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malware, or security risks within this script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The overall security risk is minimal. The use of a Telegram URL is unconventional but not harmful in itself.",
