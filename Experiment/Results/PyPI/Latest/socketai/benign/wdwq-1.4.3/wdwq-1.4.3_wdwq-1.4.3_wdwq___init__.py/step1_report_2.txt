  "purpose": "Import and execute function 'a' from a local module 'wdwq'",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .wdwq import a'",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'a()' which could potentially run malicious code if 'a' is malicious",
  "flows": "Import from local module -> execution of 'a()'",
  "anomalies": "Module name 'wdwq' is non-descriptive and could be obfuscated or deliberately obscure; no other code provided",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function 'a' from a local module 'wdwq' and executes it immediately. Without the contents of 'wdwq', it's impossible to determine if 'a' contains malicious code. The module name appears non-descriptive, which might be an attempt to obfuscate. The direct invocation of 'a()' is a potential sink that could run malicious code if 'a' is malicious. However, with only this minimal code, there is no evidence of malicious intent within the visible code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply imports and runs a function from a local module. Without additional context or contents of 'wdwq', there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The use of an obscure module name and immediate function execution warrants caution, but no definitive malicious activity can be concluded from this snippet alone.",
