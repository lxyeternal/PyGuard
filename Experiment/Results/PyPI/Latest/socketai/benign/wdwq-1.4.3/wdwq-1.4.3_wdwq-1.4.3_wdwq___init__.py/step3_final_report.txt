  "purpose": "Import and execute function 'a' from a local module 'wdwq'.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .wdwq import a'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'a()' which could perform any action depending on 'a's implementation.",
  "flows": "Import 'a' from 'wdwq' -> call 'a()'.",
  "anomalies": "Non-descriptive module and function names ('wdwq', 'a'), potential obfuscation, no inspection of 'wdwq' content.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal: it imports a function 'a' from a local module 'wdwq' and executes it. The module name and function are non-descriptive, raising suspicion of obfuscation but not confirming malicious intent. Without inspecting 'wdwq', the behavior of 'a()' cannot be determined. The scores across reports reflect suspicion primarily due to naming, with low evidence of malicious activity. Malware scores are appropriately low, and obfuscation scores are high where suspicion exists. The overall risk is moderate, considering the potential for hidden malicious code within 'a()' but no direct evidence. The pattern is common in obfuscated or malicious packages, but benign in legitimate cases as well. The main action recommended is to review the contents of 'wdwq' to assess 'a()' behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is minimal and potentially obfuscated, raising suspicion but not confirming malicious activity. The risk is primarily due to naming obfuscation. Further inspection of 'wdwq' is necessary to determine if 'a()' performs malicious actions. Current scores should reflect low malware likelihood but high obfuscation concern.",
