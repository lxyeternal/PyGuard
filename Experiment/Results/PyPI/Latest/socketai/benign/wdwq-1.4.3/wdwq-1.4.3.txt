      "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The only concern is the unconventional Telegram URL, which warrants cautious verification but does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified, indicating a very low security risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a directory zipping Telegram bot with no malware or obfuscation. It exhibits significant security vulnerabilities due to hardcoded credentials and unvalidated user input, leading to a moderate security risk. These issues should be addressed to prevent potential exploitation."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is minimal and potentially obfuscated, raising suspicion but not confirming malicious activity. The risk is primarily due to naming obfuscation. Further inspection of 'wdwq' is necessary to determine if 'a()' performs malicious actions. Current scores should reflect low malware likelihood but high obfuscation concern."
