{
  "purpose": "Import the 'sniff_lib' module from the local 'sniff' package or module, likely for network or packet sniffing functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement accesses the local 'sniff' module or package to load 'sniff_lib'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present in this single import statement; potential sinks would be within 'sniff_lib' when used.",
  "flows": "Data flow analysis is limited to import resolution; no runtime data flow can be assessed from this single line.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for Python imports; no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement, which is common in Python projects for importing local modules. There are no signs of malicious activity, hidden code, or security issues in this isolated statement. Since it only imports a module, it does not perform any operations that could be malicious. The potential security concern depends on the contents of 'sniff_lib', but that is outside the scope of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward relative import statement with no malicious intent or security issues evident at this level. It does not pose any risk on its own.",
