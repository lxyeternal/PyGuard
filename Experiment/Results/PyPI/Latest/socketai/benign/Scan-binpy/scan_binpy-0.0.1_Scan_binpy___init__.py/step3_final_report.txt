  "purpose": "Assessment of a minimal import statement to determine potential malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .sniff import sniff_lib'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in the snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no additional logic, data flow, or behavior. The module name 'sniff_lib' suggests network sniffing capabilities, which could be benign or malicious depending on context, but this cannot be inferred from the import alone. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is minimal (around 0.1), reflecting the lack of evidence for malicious activity. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation is detected, and the import alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and does not demonstrate malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and reflect minimal risk based solely on this snippet. Further analysis would require inspecting the contents and usage of 'sniff_lib'.",
