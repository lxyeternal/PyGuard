  "flows": "No data flows observed in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal; no apparent anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement importing 'sniff_lib' from the local package. Without additional context or implementation details, it is impossible to determine malicious intent. The import could be benign or potentially malicious if 'sniff_lib' performs harmful operations, but based solely on this snippet, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet by itself shows a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. Further context is needed to evaluate the contents of 'sniff_lib'.",
