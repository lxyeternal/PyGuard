{
  "purpose": "Import the 'sniff_lib' module from the current package for network or data analysis functions.",
  "sources": "No direct input or data sources are evident in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no data is being processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this single-line import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, but importing a module named 'sniff_lib' could be related to network packet sniffing, which could be used maliciously if combined with other code. However, the import itself is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a module from a relative path. There is no additional logic, no data handling, or network activity shown. The module name 'sniff_lib' suggests it could be used for network sniffing, but the code itself does not implement any behavior. Without more context, the import alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious behavior. It may be part of a larger package that performs network analysis or sniffing. Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity.",
