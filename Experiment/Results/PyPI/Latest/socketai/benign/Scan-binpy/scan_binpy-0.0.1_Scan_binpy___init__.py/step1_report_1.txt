  "purpose": "Import the 'sniff_lib' module from the current package, likely for network or packet sniffing functions.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'sniff_lib' from the local package.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this line.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways evident from this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious constructs present. The module name 'sniff_lib' may suggest network monitoring, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for a local module. No data input, processing, or output is visible. Without additional context or code, there's no evidence of malicious behavior. The module name might imply network-related functionality, but this is not inherently suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single import statement, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and standard. Further code review would be needed for a complete assessment.",
