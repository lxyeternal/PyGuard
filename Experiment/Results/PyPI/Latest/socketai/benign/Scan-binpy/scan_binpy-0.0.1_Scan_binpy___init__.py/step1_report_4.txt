{
  "purpose": "Importing a module named sniff_lib from the current package, likely related to network or data sniffing functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement is the source, which loads code from the package's own module 'sniff'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable within this isolated import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports a specific module from the same package. Without further context or implementation details of 'sniff_lib', it is impossible to assess malicious intent. The name 'sniff_lib' suggests network sniffing capabilities, which could be used legitimately or maliciously. There are no signs of malware or suspicious behavior in this single line.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard import that could be part of a legitimate network analysis or monitoring tool. Additional code review would be needed to fully assess the security implications.",
  "confidence": 0.5,
