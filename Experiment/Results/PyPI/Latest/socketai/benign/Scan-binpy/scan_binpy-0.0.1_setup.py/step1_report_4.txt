  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'Scan_binpy' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of 'README.md' file to use as long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content (source) and supplies it as 'long_description' (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, opens a README file to read its content, and calls setup() to define package metadata and dependencies. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage observed. The duplicate import of setuptools is redundant but not malicious. The code appears to be a standard package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
