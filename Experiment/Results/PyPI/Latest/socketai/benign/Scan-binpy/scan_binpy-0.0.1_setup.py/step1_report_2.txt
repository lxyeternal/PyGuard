{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'Scan_binpy' Python package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file to obtain long description content.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setuptools.setup()' which processes the provided metadata; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content (source) and passes it to setup() as long_description (sink). No data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; duplicate 'setuptools import', straightforward setup script with no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools twice, which is redundant but harmless. Reads a README.md file to include detailed package description. Calls setup() with static, hardcoded package metadata and no dynamic or external input manipulation. No suspicious or malicious code detected; no potential for code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
