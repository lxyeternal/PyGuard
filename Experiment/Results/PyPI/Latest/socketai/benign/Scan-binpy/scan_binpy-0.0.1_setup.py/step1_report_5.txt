  "purpose": "Configure and set up the Python package 'Scan_binpy' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' content (source) used as long_description (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard setup operations without suspicious code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for package setup. It reads 'README.md' content into a variable for the long_description field. The setup() call specifies package metadata such as name, version, license, author, and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no external network activity are present. The duplicate import of 'setuptools' is redundant but harmless. Overall, this is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup file with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply prepares the package for distribution.",
