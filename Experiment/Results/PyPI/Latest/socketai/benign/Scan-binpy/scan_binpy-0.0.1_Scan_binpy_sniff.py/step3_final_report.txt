{
  "purpose": "The code reads binary files, converts their content to a human-readable string with dots for non-printable bytes, and computes SHA-256 hashes of files.",
  "sources": "File open/read operations in 'ler_e_converter_binario' and 'sf' functions, reading file contents in chunks.",
  "sinks": "Hash computation in 'sf', printing messages, and returning converted text; no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "flows": "File content is read, processed for conversion; in 'sf', chunks are fed into hash; no external data or command execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The 'sf' function contains an early return inside the while loop, causing incomplete hash calculation; minor typos ('self.tring_file') are present but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign file processing tasks without malicious intent. The early return bug in 'sf' prevents full hash calculation but does not pose security risks. No obfuscation, network activity, or malicious payloads are detected. The minor bugs are implementation flaws, not security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for file inspection and hashing, with minor bugs that do not impact security. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The overall security risk is very low.",
