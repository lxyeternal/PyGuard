{
  "purpose": "The code reads binary files, converts their content to a human-readable format, and computes their SHA-256 hash.",
  "sources": "Reading files from the filesystem (`open` calls). The file paths are provided as input to functions and class methods.",
  "sinks": "Hash computation (`hashlib.sha256`) and printing outputs. The file content is read and processed, but not directly exposed externally beyond hash and conversion outputs.",
  "flows": "File paths (sources) are used to read file contents, which are then either converted or hashed. The results are printed; no external data is sent over networks or stored.",
  "anomalies": "Potential typo in variable name `self.tring_file` (should be `self.string_file`). No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. The code performs benign file operations. Minor formatting issues, but no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to read binary files and convert their content to text, replacing non-printable bytes with dots, and compute SHA-256 hashes of files. The class `sniff_lib` provides methods to invoke these functions and print results. The code does not contain obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The only concern is a typo in `convert_sha256` method (`self.tring_file`) which could cause runtime errors but no malicious intent. There are no hardcoded credentials or signs of malicious payloads. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for file inspection or verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for reading binary files, converting their content, and computing hashes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The only issue is a typo that could cause errors, but this does not imply malicious intent.",
