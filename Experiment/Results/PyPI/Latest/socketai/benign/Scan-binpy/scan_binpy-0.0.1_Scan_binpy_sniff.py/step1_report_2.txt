{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to read and convert binary files into readable text and to compute their SHA-256 hash.",
  "sources": "File paths provided to 'ler_e_converter_binario' and 'sf' functions; reading files in binary mode.",
  "sinks": "Reading files from disk; hashing file contents with hashlib.sha256.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> open and read file content -> convert or hash content -> return result.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The file path checks exclude specific files but do not appear malicious. The hashing function is standard and used for integrity checks. The print statement in 'convert_sha256' references a variable 'self.tring_file' which is undefined, indicating a probable typo but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code reads files and converts binary data to ASCII representation, replacing non-printable bytes with dots. It also computes SHA-256 hashes of files. The functions include safeguards for specific filenames, skipping processing for certain files. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. The presence of a typo ('self.tring_file') does not indicate malicious activity but suggests possible code quality issues. The functions operate locally on files, with no evident intent of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, performing standard file reading, conversion, and hashing tasks without any malicious behavior or supply chain threats. Minor coding issues are present but do not impact security.",
