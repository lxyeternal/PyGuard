{
  "purpose": "Imports all contents from the local module 'djcode' for use in the current script.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the 'djcode' module file within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as data output, network communication, or sensitive operations are visible in this line.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'djcode' module into the current script through the import statement; no further flow is observable from this line alone.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') is generally discouraged as it can obscure imported components and potentially hide malicious code, but on its own it is not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement using a relative import to include all definitions from 'djcode'. Without additional context or content from 'djcode', it's impossible to assess if it contains malicious code or behavior. The wildcard import can be risky because it can import unintended or malicious components if 'djcode' is compromised. No other suspicious patterns or anomalies are present in this single line.",
  "conclusion": "This code imports all elements from the 'djcode' module. While the import itself is not malicious, the use of wildcard imports can hide malicious or unintended code. Further review of the 'djcode' module is necessary to fully assess security risks.",
