  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'djcode' using a wildcard import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; potential data flow depends on 'djcode' contents.",
  "sinks": "Potentially in 'djcode' if it executes code, reads environment variables, or performs network operations.",
  "flows": "Importing 'djcode' may execute top-level code, which could lead to data leaks or malicious actions if 'djcode' is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure imported components, hiding malicious code; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement that brings in all components from 'djcode'. Without inspecting 'djcode', the security implications depend on its content. The use of wildcard import is discouraged as it can hide malicious or unintended code. The import may execute top-level code in 'djcode', which could be malicious if 'djcode' is compromised. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior is present in this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.2-0.4) are appropriate given the context. The risk primarily stems from the practice of wildcard import, which can conceal malicious code, but the import statement itself is benign. Further review of 'djcode' is necessary to confirm safety.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is syntactically correct and not malicious on its own. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious components in 'djcode'. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score reflecting the potential for concealment. A thorough review of 'djcode' is recommended to ensure no malicious code is present.",
