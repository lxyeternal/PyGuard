  "conclusion": "The import statement is syntactically correct and not malicious on its own. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious components in 'djcode'. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score reflecting the potential for concealment. A thorough review of 'djcode' is recommended to ensure no malicious code is present."
