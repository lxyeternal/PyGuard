  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code and potential risks.\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\nfrom .djcode import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the wildcard import from 'djcode' and notes that it can hide malicious code, but cannot determine if 'djcode' is malicious without further inspection.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a cautious and reasonable assessment. Wildcard imports are discouraged because they obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious components. The conclusion that further review of 'djcode' is necessary is correct.  \n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that 'import *' can hide malicious code, and the actual risk depends on 'djcode's content.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.6  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.4\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, a cautious stance. The higher security risk score (0.4) compared to others reflects the potential danger of obscured malicious code. This is reasonable given the context.  \n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, highlights the risk of wildcard import hiding malicious code, but notes that the import itself is benign.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.4  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments. The lower confidence is appropriate given the lack of 'djcode' inspection.  \n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar cautious stance, emphasizes that 'djcode' content determines maliciousness, and that wildcard import can conceal malicious behavior.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.4  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.3\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent and reasonable. No evidence of malicious activity from the import alone.  \n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the import pattern, notes that it’s not malicious by itself but warrants further review.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.6  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate and balanced. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  The code is just a wildcard import. It does **not** contain malicious code itself, but the pattern is risky because it can hide malicious components in 'djcode'.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:**  \n  All reports correctly identify the potential risk of using `import *` and emphasize the need to review 'djcode'. None make unfounded assumptions; all are cautious.\n\n- **Scores and reasoning:**  \n  - Malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate since the import line alone cannot be malicious without inspecting 'djcode'.\n  - Security risk scores are moderate (0.2-0.4), reflecting the potential risk due to obscurity, which is reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5, which is appropriate given the information.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since no malicious activity is evident from the import statement alone, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly stating that the actual risk depends on 'djcode's content.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and cautious.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- The use of wildcard import warrants caution but isn't inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity from the import statement alone)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation in the code snippet itself)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 - 0.4 (moderate due to obscurity and potential for malicious code hiding)\n\n**Given the pattern and context, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.3 (a balanced middle ground considering the potential risks of wildcard imports)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and cautious. The code itself isn't malicious but warrants further review of 'djcode'. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
