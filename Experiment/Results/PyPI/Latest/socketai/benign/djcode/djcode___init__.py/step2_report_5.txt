  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports focus on the same code: `from .djcode import *`.\n- The core concern is the use of a wildcard import, which can obscure malicious code within `djcode`.\n- No direct malware or obfuscation is identified in the import statement itself.\n- The actual risk depends heavily on the content of `djcode`, which is not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and assessments:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is a simple import statement; no malicious code or anomalies are directly visible.\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged because it obscures what is imported, which could hide malicious components if `djcode` is compromised.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present in this snippet alone.\n\n**2. Logical flaws or mistakes:**\n- No syntactic or logical errors are evident.\n- The main flaw is the use of `import *`, which is a bad practice, but not inherently malicious.\n\n**3. Scores review:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of direct malicious code in this snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with no evidence of obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.4; given the potential for hidden malicious code in `djcode`, these are reasonable cautionary scores.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk > 0.5; scores are conservative, reflecting uncertainty due to lack of visibility into `djcode`.\n\n**5. Malware scoring:**\n- Correctly set to 0, as the import statement itself is not malicious.\n\n**6. Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities but highlight potential risks if `djcode` contains malicious code.\n- This is appropriate; without inspecting `djcode`, we cannot confirm or deny maliciousness.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis and cautious stance.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The import statement itself is benign but potentially risky due to the wildcard import.\n- The main concern is the content of `djcode`, which remains unverified.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable given the information.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n\n| Metric             | Score (0 to 1) | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0              | No evidence of malicious code in the import statement itself. |\n| Obfuscated         | 0              | No signs of obfuscation; no code content to analyze.        |\n| Risk               | 0.3            | Moderate caution due to use of `import *`, which can hide malicious code if `djcode` is compromised. |\n\n**Note:** The actual security risk hinges on the trustworthiness of `djcode`. If `djcode` is from an untrusted source, the risk increases significantly.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n- The code snippet is syntactically correct and not malicious on its own.\n- The use of `import *` warrants caution, especially if `djcode` is untrusted.\n- A thorough review of `djcode` is essential for a complete security assessment.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.3\n\nThis balanced approach reflects the current evidence and best practices.",
