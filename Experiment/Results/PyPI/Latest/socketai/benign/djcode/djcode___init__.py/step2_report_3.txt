  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a simple `from .djcode import *`. No malicious code or anomalies are directly visible here.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly notes that wildcard imports can hide malicious components, but the code itself isn't malicious.\n- **Scores:** Confidence is 0.6; malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.2. These seem reasonable given the minimal context.\n- **Risk justification:** Since the import could conceal malicious code in 'djcode', a cautious approach is justified, but no evidence suggests maliciousness here.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; no direct evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report emphasizes the risk of obscured imports, which is valid, but again, no malicious code is demonstrated.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.6, security risk 0.4, malware 0.0. Slightly higher security risk score is acceptable given the practice of wildcard imports.\n- **Risk justification:** The risk is mainly due to potential concealment, not actual malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous; no visible malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The analysis is consistent; it notes that the import could hide malicious code but doesn't claim maliciousness.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.4, malware 0, security risk 0.2. These are consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Adequate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern; no direct evidence.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly points out that the import could conceal malicious code, but no actual malicious activity is observed.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.4, malware 0, security risk 0.3. Slightly higher risk score is acceptable due to the practice.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; only an import statement.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly states that the import alone isn't malicious but warrants further review.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.6, malware 0, security risk 0.2. Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is just an import statement, with no direct malicious activity visible.\n- **Use of wildcard import:** The main concern is the potential for 'djcode' to contain malicious code, but without inspection, this remains speculative.\n- **Scores:** The scores across reports are consistent with the cautious stance that wildcard imports can hide malicious code but do not confirm maliciousness.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Given no evidence of malicious activity, I agree with a malware score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Since the code is straightforward, a score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** The risk is mainly due to the practice of wildcard import, which can hide malicious code. I would suggest a slightly higher risk score, perhaps around 0.3, to reflect this concern.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.3\n\n**Summary:** The import statement itself is benign but should prompt review of 'djcode' for malicious content, especially given the use of wildcard import. The current scores are reasonable, but a slightly increased risk score would better reflect the potential for concealment.",
