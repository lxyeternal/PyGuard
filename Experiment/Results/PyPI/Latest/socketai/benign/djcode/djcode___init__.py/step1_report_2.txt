{
  "purpose": "Import all contents from the module 'djcode' within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'djcode' module from the local package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink or external communication directly visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A in this snippet; no data flow can be determined from an import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'from .djcode import *' can hide which functions or variables are imported, potentially obscuring malicious code or backdoors within 'djcode'. This practice can be used to hide malicious imports or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement that imports all symbols from the 'djcode' module in the same package. Since no further code is provided, the behavior depends entirely on the contents of 'djcode'. The use of a wildcard import can be considered suspicious because it obscures what is being imported and can hide malicious code or unintended behavior within 'djcode'. No other code or context is present to evaluate specific malicious behavior. The security posture depends on the integrity and content of the 'djcode' module itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is minimal, but the use of 'import *' from a local module can be a tactic to obscure malicious or unintended code. Without inspecting 'djcode', the risk remains uncertain but warrants caution due to the import style.",
