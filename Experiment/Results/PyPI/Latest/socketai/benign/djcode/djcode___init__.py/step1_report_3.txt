{
  "purpose": "Imports all functions and classes from the local module 'djcode'.",
  "sources": "The source is the local module 'djcode' imported via relative import.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are evident in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only performs an import, no data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') can be a sign of obfuscation or poor practice, potentially hiding malicious code or unwanted behaviors in 'djcode'.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a relative import from 'djcode'. Without inspecting the content of 'djcode', it is impossible to determine if malicious behavior exists. The use of a wildcard import is generally discouraged because it can conceal imported names and lead to maintenance or security issues. No further suspicious activity can be inferred from this single line alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple relative import with no immediate evidence of malicious intent. However, the use of wildcard import warrants caution, especially if 'djcode' contains malicious or unwanted code. A review of the 'djcode' module is recommended for comprehensive security assessment.",
