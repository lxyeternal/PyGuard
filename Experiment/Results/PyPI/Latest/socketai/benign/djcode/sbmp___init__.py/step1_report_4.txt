  "purpose": "Import all functions, classes, or variables from the local module named 'djsbmp'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'djsbmp' module from the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present in this line; potential data flows depend on usage within 'djsbmp' or subsequent code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows can be determined from this single line; it simply imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local module 'djsbmp'. This is a standard import statement and does not by itself introduce any malicious behavior. Without additional context or code, it is impossible to determine if 'djsbmp' contains malicious code. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets present in this snippet. The import could be benign or malicious depending on the contents of 'djsbmp', but based solely on this line, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. Its safety depends on the content of the 'djsbmp' module, which cannot be assessed here. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detectable in this single line.",
