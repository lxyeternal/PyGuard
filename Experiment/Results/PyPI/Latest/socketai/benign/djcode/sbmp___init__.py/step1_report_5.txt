{
  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'djsbmp'.",
  "sources": "The import statement imports the 'djsbmp' module located in the same package or directory.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network operations, file writes, or data leaks are present in this line.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and only contains an import statement; no suspicious or unusual code features are present. However, importing entire modules can sometimes hide malicious code if the module itself is malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a module named 'djsbmp' from the current package. There are no other operations, data handling, or network interactions in this snippet. The security implications depend entirely on the contents of 'djsbmp', which is not provided. The import alone does not indicate malicious intent, but it warrants further review of the 'djsbmp' module for any malicious or suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no immediate malicious behavior. The security concern depends on the contents of the imported module, which cannot be assessed here. Based solely on this line, there is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
