  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module '.djsbmp' within the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak information.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is a static import with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can obscure imported symbols but is not inherently malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement, bringing in all symbols from the 'djsbmp' module. No code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs here. The primary concern with such an import is the potential for hidden malicious symbols within 'djsbmp', but this cannot be assessed without inspecting that module. The use of '*' reduces code clarity but does not imply malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this import. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero; risk scores are very low (0 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern based solely on this line.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and standard; no malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The security risk is minimal, contingent on the contents of 'djsbmp', which are not provided. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no changes are necessary.",
