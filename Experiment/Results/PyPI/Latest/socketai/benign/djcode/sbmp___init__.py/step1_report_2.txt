{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module '.djsbmp', likely for use in the current package or script.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local package module '.djsbmp'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks; the code does not process data or execute untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident from this single import statement; it simply includes code from another module.",
  "anomalies": "The import uses a relative import syntax which is typical in packages but does not indicate malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a local module '.djsbmp'. This is a standard practice in Python packages to include internal modules. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security risks are evident. Since the code is minimal and straightforward, it appears benign. No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or potential sinks are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement appears to be a normal part of a Python package's internal structure with no indication of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not pose any threat or suspicious activity.",
