  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\nfrom .djsbmp import *\n```\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \n- A relative import bringing in all contents from the `djsbmp` module within the same package.  \n- No additional logic, data processing, or network activity is present.  \n- Use of wildcard import (`*`) can obscure what is imported but is not inherently malicious.  \n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `.djsbmp`  \n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no anomalies, straightforward import.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n**Assessment:** Accurate. The import appears benign. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Import from `.djsbmp`  \n- **Findings:** No direct sinks, standard practice, no anomalies.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is a simple import, no malicious implications.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `.djsbmp`  \n- **Findings:** Use of wildcard import, but no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.2 (lower due to uncertainty about the module's content)  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low)  \n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The import itself is benign; the concern about the module's content remains but cannot be assessed here.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Import everything from local `djsbmp`  \n- **Findings:** No suspicious constructs, depends on module content.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.4  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n**Assessment:** Correct. The import is standard; potential risks depend on `djsbmp` contents.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `djsbmp`  \n- **Findings:** No immediate security risks, depends on module content.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.6  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2  \n**Assessment:** Accurate. The import is benign in isolation.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Evaluation:\n\n- All reports agree that the import statement is straightforward and not malicious.  \n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present in the import line itself.  \n- The primary concern about the imported module's content remains valid but cannot be assessed without inspecting `djsbmp`.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity in the import statement itself.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code being straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.2, which is reasonable given the import alone.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are appropriate given the limited context.  \n- Since the import is from a local module, the main security concern would be the content of `djsbmp`, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary & My Expert Judgment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard import, no suspicious activity)\n\n**Overall, the import statement appears benign and standard.**  \nAny potential security concern hinges entirely on the contents of the `djsbmp` module, which is not provided here.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. No changes are necessary. The code snippet is safe in isolation.",
