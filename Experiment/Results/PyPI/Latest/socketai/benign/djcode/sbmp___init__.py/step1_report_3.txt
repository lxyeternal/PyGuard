  "purpose": "Import all contents from the module '.djsbmp'",
  "sources": "Import statement indicates data or functionality is sourced from the local or relative module '.djsbmp'",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present in this line; potential sink if imported module contains malicious code",
  "flows": "Code imports data or code from '.djsbmp', which could contain further source-to-sink flows if used elsewhere",
  "anomalies": "The import statement itself is straightforward; no anomalies detected here. However, importing everything with '*' can obscure what functions or data are brought into scope",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a relative module. It does not specify what is imported or contain any executable logic. Without inspecting the contents of '.djsbmp', no malicious behavior can be determined from this line alone. The use of a wildcard import is not inherently malicious but can be risky if the imported module contains harmful code. No other suspicious or anomalous code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The line itself is a standard import; however, without further details on the imported module, a full security assessment cannot be performed. No signs of malware or malicious intent are evident at this point.",
