{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local module 'djsbmp' using a relative import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the import does not involve runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*'), which can obscure imported symbols but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leakage are present. The use of wildcard import is generally discouraged for clarity but does not constitute malicious behavior. The security implications depend entirely on the contents of 'djsbmp', which are not provided. The code does not perform any operations, handle inputs, or execute logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and does not exhibit malicious behavior. The use of wildcard import is a poor practice but not malicious. The scores should reflect minimal risk and no malware or obfuscation, with a very low security risk primarily due to the wildcard import practice.",
