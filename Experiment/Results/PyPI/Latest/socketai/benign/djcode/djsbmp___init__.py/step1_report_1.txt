  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement, bringing all functions, classes, or variables from 'djsbmp' into the current namespace. There are no operations, data processing, or external inputs involved. Given only this single import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The import source is a local module, which is common in Python projects. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns based solely on this line. It does not exhibit any anomalous, malicious, or risky behavior.",
