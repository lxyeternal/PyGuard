  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the original code snippet:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\nfrom .djsbmp import *\n```\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- A relative import from a local module `djsbmp`.\n- Uses a wildcard import, which can obscure what is imported.\n- No data processing, input, or output occurs in this line.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior visible from this snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import all from local `djsbmp`.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states this is a straightforward import, no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 — reasonable given the simplicity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Import all contents from `djsbmp`.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the use of wildcard `*`, which can be considered bad practice but isn't inherently malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that actual security risk depends on `djsbmp` contents.\n- **Confidence:** 0.4 — appropriate.\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Import all from local `djsbmp`.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the minimal nature of the code and correctly states that no malicious behavior can be inferred.\n- **Confidence:** 0.3 — acceptable.\n- **Malware:** 0 — aligns with the reasoning.\n- **Verdict:** Sound.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `djsbmp`.\n- **Analysis:** Repeats the same reasoning; no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence, which is justified for such a simple import.\n- **Malware:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Import all contents from `djsbmp`.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states this is a benign import with no immediate security concern.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5 — reasonable.\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple import statement.\n- Use of wildcard import (`*`) is noted but not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The malware scores should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- Obfuscated scores are correctly at 0.\n- The risk scores are appropriate given the limited context.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal risk from a simple import statement, especially considering the wildcard usage)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No further action or concern is necessary based solely on this import statement.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for the wildcard import, which can be considered poor practice but not malicious)\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to review additional code or context.",
