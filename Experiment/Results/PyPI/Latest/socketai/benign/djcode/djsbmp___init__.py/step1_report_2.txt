  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module 'djsbmp' in the current package.",

  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this snippet; potential for imported module to contain sinks.",
  "flows": "The current code only imports the module; no data flow analysis possible from this snippet alone.",
  "anomalies": "The import uses a wildcard '*', which can obscure what is imported and potentially mask malicious or unnecessary code. No other anomalies detected in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement with a wildcard, which can be considered a bad practice due to lack of clarity. Since no other code is present, no malicious behavior or suspicious activities are evident at this stage. The actual security risks depend on the contents of 'djsbmp'.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is a basic import statement with no inherent malicious behavior. The security risk largely depends on the contents of the 'djsbmp' module, which is not provided. The use of a wildcard import can hide imported elements, which could be suspicious if the module contains malicious code, but cannot be confirmed from this snippet alone.",
