  "purpose": "Import all functions, classes, or variables from the local module 'djsbmp'.",
  "sources": "The code imports from the local module 'djsbmp'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are evident in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present in this single import statement; it's just a module import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; no anomalies are apparent from a single line. However, import statements alone do not provide enough context for malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a relative import from a module named 'djsbmp'. No other logic, data input, or execution is present. Without additional context or code, it is impossible to determine if the module itself is malicious or if the import is part of malicious activity. No suspicious patterns or unusual code structures are evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this single import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign in isolation, but a full review of the 'djsbmp' module and the larger codebase is necessary to ensure security.",
