  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their assessments, and determine appropriate scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Simple relative import from a local module 'djsbmp'. No anomalies or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.8 (originally 0), confidence=0.8\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The code is benign; it's a straightforward import statement.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The original securityRisk score of 0.8 seems high for such a simple import. I recommend lowering it to 0, as there's no evidence of risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Wildcard import (`from .djsbmp import *`). The report notes that this practice can obscure imported elements, potentially hiding malicious code, but no malicious activity is evident here.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.4\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Wildcard imports are generally discouraged due to clarity issues but are not inherently malicious.\n- Since the actual module content isn't provided, no evidence of malicious code can be confirmed.\n- The low securityRisk score (0.2) seems appropriate, but I suggest maintaining malware=0 and obfuscated=0 unless there's additional context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, import from 'djsbmp' with no other code. No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.3\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Again, a benign import statement.\n- The very low securityRisk score is appropriate.\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Import all from 'djsbmp', no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Completely benign; a standard import.\n- The confidence is high, and the scores are consistent.\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Import all from 'djsbmp', no issues detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.5\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Again, a benign import statement.\n- The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the code snippets provided.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk scores:** Most are very low or zero, which is appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n**However,** the first report's original securityRisk score of 0.8 is overstated. Since there's no evidence of risk, malware, or obfuscation, I recommend reducing it to **0**.\n\n**Additionally,** wildcard imports (Report 2) are considered bad practice but not malicious per se. The risk associated with such practice should remain low unless additional malicious content is found.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Adjusted Scores & Justifications:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Notes |\n|---------|---------|--------------|----------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0              | No malicious activity; simple import. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.1 → 0      | Wildcard import; bad practice but not malicious. |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.1 → 0      | Similar benign import. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Benign import. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Benign import. |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code snippets are benign import statements with no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The original higher security risk scores in some reports should be lowered to zero.\n- The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The overall risk assessment indicates minimal security concern based solely on these import statements.\n\n**Final note:** For a more comprehensive security evaluation, analysis of the actual 'djsbmp' module contents and how these imports are used in the larger codebase would be necessary.",
