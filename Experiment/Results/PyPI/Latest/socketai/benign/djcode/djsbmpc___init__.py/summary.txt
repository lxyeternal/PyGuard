  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The risk is very low, primarily related to coding practices rather than security flaws. The current scores are appropriate; the wildcard import warrants cautious review of 'djsbmp' content but does not indicate malicious behavior."
