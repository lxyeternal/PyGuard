{
  "purpose": "Import all functions, classes, or variables from the module 'djsbmp' located in the same package directory.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which loads code from the local 'djsbmp' module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the imported module may contain code that reads or processes untrusted data, but the import statement alone does not do this.",
  "flows": "No direct data flow; the import just makes 'djsbmp' contents available in the current module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident from this alone.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single relative import statement. This does not by itself perform any data processing, input/output, or network activity. Without additional context or code, there are no observable malicious behaviors, data leaks, or suspicious activities. The import could be benign or malicious depending on the contents of 'djsbmp', which is not provided. As it stands, the code does not contain any embedded malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple relative import, which by itself poses no security threat or malicious intent. No evidence of malware or security risks is found from this fragment alone.",
