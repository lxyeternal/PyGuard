  "purpose": "Import from local module 'djsbmp'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no other data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads module 'djsbmp' into namespace; no data flow beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import 'from .djsbmp import *' can obscure imported content, potentially hiding malicious code, but the statement itself is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement, either absolute or relative, with no additional logic. All reports correctly identify that this is benign and standard Python syntax. The primary concern is the wildcard import, which can hide malicious code if present in 'djsbmp', but without inspecting the module, this remains speculative. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately low (0), and security risk is minimal (0.1-0.2). Confidence levels are justified given the simplicity of the code. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The risk is very low, primarily related to coding practices rather than security flaws. The current scores are appropriate; the wildcard import warrants cautious review of 'djsbmp' content but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
