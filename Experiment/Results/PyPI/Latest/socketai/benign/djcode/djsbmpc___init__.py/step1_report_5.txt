{
  "purpose": "Import all functions, classes, or variables from the module '.djsbmp'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module '.djsbmp'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible with this single import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import with a wildcard ('*') can be risky as it obscures what is imported; however, it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a relative import from a local module named 'djsbmp'. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of 'from ... import *' can hide the imported components, which could potentially include malicious code, but the import itself is not malicious. Further analysis of the 'djsbmp' module would be necessary to determine its security posture.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The use of wildcard import warrants caution, but it is common in Python modules and not necessarily malicious. Additional context or code is needed for a comprehensive assessment.",
