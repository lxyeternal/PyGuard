  "purpose": "The code imports all definitions from the local module 'djsbmp'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module 'djsbmp'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; import only pulls code from a local module without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement alone is minimal and typical; no suspicious or unusual patterns are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement from a local module. There are no functions, user inputs, network operations, or other behaviors that could indicate malicious activity. Without additional context or code, there's no evidence of malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues. The import could be benign and part of a normal project structure.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is simple and appears to perform a standard import from a local module. Due to lack of additional code, the confidence in this assessment is high.",
