{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions, classes, or variables from a module named djsbmp within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (djsbmp). No external input or data sources are read directly in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this code fragment, as it only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows are evident in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no additional logic. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module djsbmp, which could contain any kind of code. Since only the import statement is shown, there are no security concerns visible at this point. The import itself is standard Python behavior, and no malicious activity can be inferred solely from this statement. However, without inspecting the contents of djsbmp, the overall security cannot be fully assessed, but based on this snippet alone, there is no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based solely on this snippet. Full security evaluation would require analyzing the contents of the imported module.",
