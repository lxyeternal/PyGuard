{
  "purpose": "This code provides a modular system for managing and generating multiple source code files in various programming languages, such as C++, Java, PHP, and Flutter. It includes predefined code snippets for educational, demonstrative, or organizational purposes across different domains like cryptography, data structures, Android development, web development, and cybersecurity.",
  "sources": "User input prompts for filename selection, reading and writing code snippets to files, and user-driven selection of code snippets for storage or editing.",
  "sinks": "Writing code snippets to files based on user input; no direct execution, network operations, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "User selects a filename; program retrieves the corresponding code snippet from predefined dictionaries and writes it to the specified file, enabling manual code management.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious logic. All code snippets are straightforward templates for educational or organizational use. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script organizes various code snippets into categorized dictionaries and provides functions for listing files and writing selected snippets to disk based on user input. No external or untrusted data is processed, and the code does not perform network activity, system modifications, or execute potentially harmful commands. It functions as a source code management utility for educational or organizational purposes, with clear and safe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structured utility for managing predefined code snippets across multiple domains. It exhibits no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears intended for educational, demonstrative, or organizational use without any malicious behavior.",
