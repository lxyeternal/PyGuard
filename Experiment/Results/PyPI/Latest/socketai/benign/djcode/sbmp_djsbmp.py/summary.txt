  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that the keylogger code is malicious and warrants maximum malware and security risk scores. Other snippets are benign. The scores are consistent with the code behaviors. The high scores for reports with keylogger code are justified. No obfuscation is detected, so scores are appropriate. The keylogger should be handled with extreme caution and excluded from deployment unless for controlled security research."
