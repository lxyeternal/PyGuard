{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools, with static metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package name, version, description, packages, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic execution, external data, or malicious patterns. All dependencies are common scientific packages, and the code contains only hardcoded strings and lists. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
