  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static, standard setup script for packaging a Python project.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is straightforward, importing only 'setuptools' and calling 'setup()' with hardcoded parameters.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- Dependencies are common scientific libraries, not indicative of malicious activity.\n- No dynamic data, external inputs, or network activity.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are all 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, benign setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed.",
