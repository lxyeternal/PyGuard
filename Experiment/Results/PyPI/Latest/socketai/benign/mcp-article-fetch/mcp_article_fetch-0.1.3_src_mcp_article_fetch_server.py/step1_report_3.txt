  "purpose": "Extract article content from a given URL using web scraping techniques.",
  "sources": "User-provided URL input passed to the extract_article function.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs via requests.get, parsing response text with BeautifulSoup, returning extracted content.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> requests.get -> response.text -> BeautifulSoup parsing -> extracted article content -> return result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious obfuscated code. The code performs standard web scraping operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a custom module 'mcp.server.fastmcp' and uses its 'FastMCP' class to define a tool 'extract_article'. It performs an HTTP GET request to fetch webpage content with a user-agent header, then parses HTML with BeautifulSoup to extract main article content based on common div selectors. The code handles exceptions gracefully. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity is evident. Usage of external libraries 'requests' and 'BeautifulSoup' is standard for web scraping. The code does not contain obfuscated segments, nor does it perform any suspicious operations beyond typical content extraction.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate web scraper designed to extract article content from URLs. No malicious or suspicious behavior was identified. It relies on standard libraries and performs expected functions without evident security risks.",
