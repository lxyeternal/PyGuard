  "purpose": "Import the Safeguards class from a local module named safeguards",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from .safeguards module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths present in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Single line import statement; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "This code imports a class named Safeguards from a local module. The import appears standard with no obfuscated or suspicious syntax. Since this is only an import statement, it does not perform any data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. No malicious behavior can be inferred from this isolated line. No hidden or malicious code is visible. The overall code snippet is minimal but typical for modular Python code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports a class from a local module, which is common in Python projects.",
