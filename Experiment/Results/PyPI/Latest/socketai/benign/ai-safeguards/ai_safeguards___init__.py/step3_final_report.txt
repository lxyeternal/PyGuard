  "purpose": "Import the Safeguards class from a local module named safeguards.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of a class from a local module. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution is involved. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. Given the minimal context, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and standard. All assessments and scores are appropriate. No security concerns or malicious activity are indicated by this code snippet.",
