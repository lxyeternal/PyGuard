  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this minimal code fragment, as it only imports a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; no anomalies are apparent. It does not contain any obfuscated elements or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a relative module, which is standard in Python packages. No data processing, input reading, or potential malicious actions are present. Since this is only an import statement, it does not pose security risks by itself. No unusual behavior or signs of malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no malicious or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger, benign project.",
