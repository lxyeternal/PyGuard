  "purpose": "A class for claim extraction from text using regex or LLM, with placeholders for evaluation methods.",
  "sources": "Reads input text for claim extraction; uses external OpenAI API for LLM-based extraction.",
  "sinks": "API key stored as class attribute; external API call to OpenAI for claim extraction.",
  "flows": "Input text -> extract_claims method -> regex or API call -> output claims list.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out methods for similarity and factuality evaluation; no malicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for claim extraction, with optional advanced evaluation features currently inactive. API key is passed as a parameter, not hardcoded. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. External API interactions are standard for NLP tasks. Commented-out code does not execute and poses no risk in current form.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily designed for claim extraction with placeholder methods for future evaluation. No malicious or obfuscated content detected. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified due to external API use and API key handling, which should be managed securely in deployment.",
