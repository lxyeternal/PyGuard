  "purpose": "A class for claim extraction from text using regex or an LLM API (OpenAI), with API key handling.",
  "sources": "Input text provided to extract_claims method, API call to OpenAI with input data.",
  "sinks": "Sending input data over network to OpenAI API, potential exposure of API key if logs or sharing occur.",
  "flows": "Input text -> extract_claims (regex or LLM) -> API request -> JSON response parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; API key stored as class attribute; no input validation shown.",
  "analysis": "The code performs claim extraction via regex or OpenAI API, with standard API key handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration observed. External API calls are typical, and the code is straightforward. The primary security concern is API key management and data privacy, which are common considerations. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal security concerns related to external API use and data privacy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily related to API key handling and data privacy, which are standard issues. The report scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
