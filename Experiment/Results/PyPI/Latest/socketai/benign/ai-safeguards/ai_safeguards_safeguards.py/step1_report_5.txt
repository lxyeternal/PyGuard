{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for running RAG metrics, specifically extracting claims from text using regex or an LLM.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters (text, extraction_method), environment (API key), and external modules (OpenAI).",
  "sinks": "Potentially sends data to OpenAI API endpoint for LLM processing; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input text and extraction method flow into the extract_claims method; if using LLM, data flows from input to API call and back to output.",
  "anomalies": "Uses OpenAI's API to generate claims, but the code constructs an API call with instructions and parses the JSON response. No suspicious code or obfuscation detected. The API call and JSON parsing appear standard. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a class with model name and API key. The extract_claims method splits input text either via regex or calls OpenAI's API. The regex pattern is standard for sentence splitting. The API call uses a prompt to extract claims, then parses JSON output. No unusual code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. Usage of environment variables or API keys is appropriate, assuming secure storage outside this code snippet. External dependencies and API interactions are typical for such applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, designed for claim extraction from text using regex or a language model. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code relies on external APIs but does not exhibit malicious behavior within the provided scope.",
