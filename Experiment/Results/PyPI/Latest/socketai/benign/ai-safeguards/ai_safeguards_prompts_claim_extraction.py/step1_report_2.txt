  "purpose": "This code defines a string prompt for a language model to analyze responses and extract claims from provided text, formatted as a JSON object.",
  "sources": "The string is a constant assignment, primarily containing the example text, instructions, and expected JSON format.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not include any data input/output operations, network calls, or interactions with untrusted sources. It only stores a static string.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present in this code snippet beyond the static assignment of the prompt string.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual constructs. It is a straightforward string assignment for a prompt template.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a prompt template intended for use with a language model. It includes an example input and output format to guide claim extraction. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The static string does not perform any data processing or execution; it merely stores instructions for later use.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template string used for instructing a language model. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscated elements present. It functions solely as a prompt definition.",
