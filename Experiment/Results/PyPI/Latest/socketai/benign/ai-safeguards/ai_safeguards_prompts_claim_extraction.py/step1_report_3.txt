  "purpose": "The code defines a prompt template for extracting claims from a given text, intended for use in a response analysis or language model task.",
  "sources": "The code source is the string variable CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT containing the prompt template.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not contain untrusted data input, data output, or security-sensitive operations; it only defines a static string.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks within this code snippet; it's a static string definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behavior detected. The code appears to be a straightforward prompt template.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a multi-line string to a variable, which serves as a prompt template for claim extraction tasks. There are no input handling, data processing, or output operations involved. It does not perform any network operations, execute code, or handle user data. The string itself contains example data and instructions, with no embedded code logic or dynamic elements.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static prompt template for claim extraction, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code present. It is safe and solely for defining a prompt.",
