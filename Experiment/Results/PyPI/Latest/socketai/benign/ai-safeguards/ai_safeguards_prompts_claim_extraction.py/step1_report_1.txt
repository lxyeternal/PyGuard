  "purpose": "The code defines a prompt template for a response analysis task, specifically extracting claims from provided text.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text (the sample text to be analyzed) and the CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT string containing the instructions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a JSON object containing the extracted claims, which could be used downstream for further processing or storage.",
  "flows": "Input text is fed into the prompt template; the prompt guides the analysis; the output is a JSON object with claims.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for prompt templating.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static string defining a prompt template used for instructing a language model to extract claims from text. It includes an example to guide the extraction process. The structure is simple, containing no dynamic execution, network calls, or obfuscated constructs. The code is focused solely on defining a prompt message, which is safe. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign prompt template for claim extraction with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
