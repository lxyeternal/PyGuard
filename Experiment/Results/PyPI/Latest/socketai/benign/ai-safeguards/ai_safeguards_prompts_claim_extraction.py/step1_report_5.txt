  "purpose": "Define a prompt template for extracting claims from a given text response.",
  "sources": "The string assigned to CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT, including the example text and instructions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not process or execute data beyond defining a string.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or untrusted data processing in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a static string template with no dynamic execution, input handling, or data manipulation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a multi-line string to a variable, serving as a prompt template for claim extraction tasks. It includes an example with sample text and the expected JSON format for output. There are no functions, external calls, or data processing. The structure is straightforward and appears solely for prompt generation in an NLP context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign prompt template for use in an NLP claim extraction task. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
