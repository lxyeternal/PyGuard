{
  "purpose": "The code defines a string prompt used for guiding a language model to extract claims from provided texts, specifically for analyzing responses related to claims.",
  "sources": "The entire code snippet, specifically the string assignment to CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT.",
  "sinks": "None of the code executes untrusted data or performs operations that process input/output directly; it only defines a string constant.",
  "flows": "The string is used as a prompt template; there are no data flows or processing logic within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward string assignment with no unusual or suspicious constructs, no obfuscated code, no hidden logic, and no external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a descriptive prompt string to a variable, intended for use as a prompt template in a language model. There are no dynamic code executions, no external resource accesses, no embedded malicious instructions, and no obfuscated elements. It is a static text string designed for natural language processing purposes, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign string assignment intended as a prompt template for claim extraction tasks. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks.",
