  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static string assignment, serving as a prompt template for claim extraction.\n- They consistently identify no anomalies, suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The purpose is solely to guide a language model in extracting claims from provided text.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious content.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is a straightforward, static string template with an example and instructions.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or embedded code logic.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- The purpose is purely instructional for NLP tasks.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n- These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- Since the code is entirely benign, there's no reason to assign any higher scores for malware or obfuscation.\n- The risk score of 0 is justified.\n- The high confidence (1) is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores are reasonable and should remain as they are.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- risk: 0\n\n**Final note:**\n- No changes needed; the reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign static prompt template with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are justified and appropriate.",
