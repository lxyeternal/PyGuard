{
  "purpose": "Static string assignment for a claim extraction prompt template, intended for NLP tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it is a static string embedded in the source.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data processing or network activity occurs.",
  "flows": "The flow is static; the string is assigned to a variable without dynamic execution or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static string used as a prompt template. It contains instructions and an example for claim extraction. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not perform any I/O, network activity, or data processing. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static prompt template with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate. No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
