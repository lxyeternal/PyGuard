  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static string defining a prompt template for claim extraction.\n- No anomalies, suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The reports assign scores with high confidence (1), zero malware, zero security risk, and zero obfuscated code.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Code presence and functionality:**\n   - The code is a static string assignment (`CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT`) containing instructions and an example.\n   - No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing occurs.\n   - The purpose is to serve as a prompt template for a language model, which is safe.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical errors or omissions are evident.\n   - They correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n     - confidence: 1\n   - These are appropriate given the static, non-malicious nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, no justification is necessary.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code is purely a static string with instructions; no malware or malicious intent is present.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume vulnerabilities or malicious intent; they only describe the static nature of the code.\n   - No issues here.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-related issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward prompt template string.\n- No malicious or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is safe and should not raise any security concerns.",
