  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static string defining a prompt template for claim extraction.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The confidence scores are uniformly high (1), and malware/security risk scores are zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code is just a string assignment, no dynamic or executable code.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None detected.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports' reasoning. They correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent.\n- The obfuscated scores are all 0, consistent with the static, readable string.\n- The security risk scores are 0, justified given the lack of any security-sensitive operations.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:\n- The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions of vulnerabilities, as the code is purely static prompt text.\n- No hidden or embedded malicious instructions are present.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.\n- The descriptions match the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a benign static string used for NLP prompt engineering.\n- No modifications are necessary; the current scoring and analysis are appropriate.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The provided scores are accurate and justified.",
