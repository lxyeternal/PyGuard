{
  "purpose": "This code contains prompt templates for a factuality evaluator and a fidelity (groundedness) corrector designed for evaluating and aligning responses with a given context, likely used in a natural language processing system.",
  "sources": "Prompt template strings that define instructions and context for the evaluation and correction tasks.",
  "sinks": "No code here directly processes untrusted input or data; the code only contains string templates. No execution of untrusted code or data handling is present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code is static prompt templates with no data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain executable logic, code injection, or dynamic evaluation. It is purely descriptive template strings. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured prompts intended for AI or human evaluation of factuality and groundness. It includes instructions and context placeholders. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or data handling that could be exploited. The code is static and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of static prompt templates for evaluating factuality and grounding. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and intended for NLP evaluation purposes.",
