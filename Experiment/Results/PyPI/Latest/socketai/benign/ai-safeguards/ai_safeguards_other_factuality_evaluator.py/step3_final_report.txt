  "purpose": "Static prompt templates for evaluating factuality and groundedness in NLP tasks, with placeholders for input data.",
  "sources": "Prompt string definitions within the code, containing instructions and placeholders.",
  "sinks": "No data flow or external data handling; static strings only.",
  "flows": "None; no execution or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static prompt templates with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static prompt strings used for guiding language model evaluations. There are no executable components, data flows, or suspicious behaviors. The prompt templates are simple, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, consisting of static prompt templates for NLP evaluation tasks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are justified.",
