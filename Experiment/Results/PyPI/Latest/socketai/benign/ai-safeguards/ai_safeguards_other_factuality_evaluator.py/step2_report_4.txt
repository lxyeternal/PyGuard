  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, content, and the scoring assigned.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Defines prompts for factuality and groundness evaluation.  \n- Content: String templates with instructions.  \n- Anomalies: None; purely instructional.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Risk score: 0.5 (or lower), since no malicious behavior is present.  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate. No issues or risks identified.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar prompt templates for evaluation and correction.  \n- Content: Static strings with instructions.  \n- Anomalies: None; static, safe templates.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Risk score: 0.5 or less, as no malicious activity is evident.  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n**Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Prompts for factuality and groundedness assessment.  \n- Content: String templates with placeholders.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Risk score: 0.5 or less, no malicious behavior.  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Prompts for evaluating factuality and correction.  \n- Content: Templates with placeholders.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Risk score: 0.5 or less.  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n**Conclusion:** Correct.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Similar prompt templates for factuality evaluation.  \n- Content: Static prompts with placeholders.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Risk score: 0.5 or less.  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports are just static prompt templates, with no executable code or dynamic operations.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; all scores are correctly set to 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** None, as no data handling, execution, or external communication is involved.\n- **Scores:** All are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Should be very low, around 0.0 to 0.1, since these are purely prompt templates with no security implications.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1  \n\nThe current scores of 0 for malware and obfuscated are appropriate. The risk scores, mostly at 0.5, could be lowered to reflect the absence of any security concern.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe and benign.",
