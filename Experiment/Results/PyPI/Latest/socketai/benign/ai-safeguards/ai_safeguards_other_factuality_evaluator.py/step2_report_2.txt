  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, content, and security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Prompts for factuality/groundness evaluation.\n- Content: String templates with instructions.\n- Anomalies: None; static prompts, no executable code.\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that these are benign prompt templates with no malicious behavior. The confidence score of 1 is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar prompt templates for evaluation.\n- Content: Static strings with instructions.\n- Anomalies: None; purely descriptive.\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The analysis is accurate; the code is safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Prompts for factuality and groundedness assessments.\n- Content: String templates with placeholders.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identified as safe and non-malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Prompts for evaluating claims and correcting responses.\n- Content: String templates with placeholders.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the content; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar prompt templates for fact-checking.\n- Content: String templates with placeholders.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static prompt templates, with no executable logic or data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\nGiven the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores. The code is purely static prompt templates used for guiding language models in factuality and correction tasks. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, as a precaution, but effectively none)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and intended solely for prompt engineering in NLP tasks.",
