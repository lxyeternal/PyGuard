{
  "purpose": "The code contains prompt templates for evaluating factual accuracy and grounding of claims based on a provided context, primarily for use in AI language model tasks related to fact-checking and correction.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via format placeholders {context}, {source}, {question_original}, {response}, and {non_supported_claims}. These are used to generate prompts and do not involve external data sources or user inputs directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in the code; it does not perform any data output, network communication, or system commands. The code solely generates text prompts based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input data (context, questions, previous responses) flow into prompt templates which are then used to guide language model outputs. No data is transferred to external systems or processed in a way that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward prompt template generation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of string templates designed for prompt engineering, intended to guide an AI in assessing the factual grounding of claims and correcting responses based on a given document. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The structure is simple, and all placeholders are for input data meant for safe processing. There are no functions, network calls, or data storage activities involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely prompt template text meant for AI instruction purposes. It shows no evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe and aligns with best practices for prompt engineering.",
