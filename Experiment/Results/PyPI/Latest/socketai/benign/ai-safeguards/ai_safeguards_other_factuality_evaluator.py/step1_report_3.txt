{
  "purpose": "The code defines prompt templates for a natural language processing task involving factuality evaluation and groundedness, specifically to assess claim veracity based on provided context and to correct responses based solely on source documents.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through string templates for prompts, which include placeholders for context, claims, questions, and responses.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, code execution, or other vulnerabilities; the code only handles string formatting for prompts.",
  "flows": "Input data (context, claims, responses) is inserted into prompt templates; these are then likely fed into an LLM or similar system for processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code consists solely of string templates for prompt formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and purely consists of prompt template definitions for NLP tasks. It does not include any execution of untrusted code, network calls, or handling of sensitive data. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated segments. The templates are static, designed for use with external language models. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as prompt templates for NLP tasks related to factuality and groundedness assessment. There is no malicious intent or security risk identified.",
