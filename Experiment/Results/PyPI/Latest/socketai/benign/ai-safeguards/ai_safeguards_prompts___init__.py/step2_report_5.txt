  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import statement of CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT from a local module claim_extraction.\n- There are no signs of data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code snippets are minimal, straightforward, and typical for Python module organization.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Confirming the code:**\n- The code `from .claim_extraction import CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT` is a standard relative import in Python.\n- It does not perform any operations, so there are no data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n- The purpose is to import a prompt object or variable, which is common in modular code.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- None identified. The reports correctly interpret the code as benign and standard.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are present.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n- These scores are appropriate given the code snippet.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- Since the code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n- The malware score is correctly 0, as there's no indication of malicious intent.\n- Obfuscated code is correctly scored 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- Security risk is correctly scored 0, given the benign nature.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No suspicious behavior or patterns are assumed or inferred.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no security issues.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code snippet is a standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
