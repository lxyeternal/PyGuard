  "purpose": "Import CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT from a local module claim_extraction.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module claim_extraction.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; import statement itself does not process data.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT into the namespace; no data flow beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; code is a straightforward import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import in Python, which is standard practice. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The import is from a local module, indicating modular code organization. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the minimal and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
