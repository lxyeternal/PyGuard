  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no suspicious or unusual patterns; only an import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT from a relative module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or external network activity. The simplicity of this snippet indicates standard module import behavior with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is standard practice in Python modules.",
