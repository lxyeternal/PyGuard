  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: a straightforward relative import of CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT from a local module claim_extraction.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- All scores for obfuscated code, malware, and security risk are zero, aligning with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's content:\n- The code snippet is: `from .claim_extraction import CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT`\n- This is a standard relative import in Python, importing a variable/object from a local module.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' assessments are accurate; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All correctly identify the import as straightforward and benign.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n- The obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Any errors or flaws?**\n- No. The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n- The reasoning dismisses any suspicion of malicious activity appropriately.\n- The scores seem reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Specific considerations:\n- Since the code is only an import statement, there is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The reports do not overstate the risk; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code snippet is a standard import statement with no security concerns.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
