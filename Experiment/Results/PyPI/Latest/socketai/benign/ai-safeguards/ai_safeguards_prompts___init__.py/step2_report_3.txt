  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, correctness of the assessments, and the appropriateness of the scoring.\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Summary:** The code imports CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT from a local module; no suspicious activity.\n   - **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is benign, with no data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. - Appropriate.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward import, no anomalies.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior or security concerns.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. - Appropriate.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Summary:** Same as above, standard import.\n   - **Assessment:** Valid. No signs of malicious activity.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. - Appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Summary:** Again, a simple import statement.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct. No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. - Appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Summary:** Import of CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT from local module, no suspicious features.\n   - **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious intent or security risks.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. - Appropriate.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious or obfuscating features.\n- The malware scores are all zero, reflecting the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the straightforward import.\n- The security risk scores are zero, matching the absence of vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, with confidence scores at 1, indicating certainty.\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior that warrants higher scores.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, given the absence of vulnerabilities or security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The scores assigned are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- Confirm that in the broader context, such import statements are standard and do not introduce security risks, which aligns with the current assessment.",
