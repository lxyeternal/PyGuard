  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure the accuracy of the security assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .claim_extraction import CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT`.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, external network activity, or data handling.\n- The import is from a local module, which is standard practice.\n- The reports consistently conclude benign intent with a malware score of 0 and security risk of 0.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**\n   - Confirms straightforward import, no anomalies.\n   - Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n   - Risk score: 0 — appropriate.\n   - **No issues.**\n\n2. **Report 2:**\n   - Same as above, consistent and accurate.\n   - Malware score: 0.\n   - Risk score: 0.\n   - **No issues.**\n\n3. **Report 3:**\n   - Same consistent assessment.\n   - Malware score: 0.\n   - Risk score: 0.\n   - **No issues.**\n\n4. **Report 4:**\n   - Same as above, clear and benign.\n   - Malware score: 0.\n   - Risk score: 0.\n   - **No issues.**\n\n5. **Report 5:**\n   - Same as above, straightforward import.\n   - Malware score: 0.\n   - Risk score: 0.\n   - **No issues.**\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The risk scores are appropriately zero, given the simplicity and safety of the code.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The code snippet is minimal and standard; no reason to assign any higher risk or malware scores.\n- No evidence suggests obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The consistent assessment across all reports is appropriate.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n- I agree with the current scores.\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, I would assign:\n  - **Malware score:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n  - **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is safe, with no security concerns detected.\n- The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary; the current evaluations are accurate.",
