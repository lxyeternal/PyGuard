  "purpose": "Import a constant CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT from a local module claim_extraction",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module claim_extraction",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "The code imports CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT from claim_extraction, which may be used elsewhere in the project",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains a single import statement with relative import syntax, no anomalies or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement that pulls CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT from a sibling module claim_extraction. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration. The import suggests usage of a prompt constant, which is typical for modular code design. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or other suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, serving only as an import statement without any malicious intent or security risks.",
