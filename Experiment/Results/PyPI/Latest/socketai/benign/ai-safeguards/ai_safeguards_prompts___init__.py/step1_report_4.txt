  "purpose": "Import CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT from a local module named claim_extraction.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module 'claim_extraction' using a relative import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; this is a simple import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no unusual patterns, obfuscation, or embedded malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific variable or object from a local module using relative import syntax. It contains no input handling, no data transmission, and no processing logic. The structure is minimal and typical for Python modules. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present. This appears to be a standard import statement for modular code organization.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply references a component within the local package.",
