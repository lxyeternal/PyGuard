  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Logic**  \nAll reports describe a simple import statement:\n```python\nfrom .claim_extraction import CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT\n```\nor similar variants. The code is minimal, standard, and only performs a relative import from a local module.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Malicious Behavior**  \n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be a typical import statement used in modular Python projects.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent in their analysis; they correctly identify the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n- The reports correctly conclude that the code is benign with no security risks.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- Confidence scores are high (mostly 1), justified by the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores**  \n- Since the code is purely an import statement with no malicious or suspicious features, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The malware score remains at 0, as there's no indication of malicious intent.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The overall security risk should stay at 0.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**  \n- The only potential concern could be if CLAIM_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT itself is malicious, but this cannot be determined from the import statement alone.\n- The reports correctly do not assume anything beyond the code snippet provided.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, benign import statement.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- Scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimates for the scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThese reflect the benign and standard nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, and the scores are justified. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
