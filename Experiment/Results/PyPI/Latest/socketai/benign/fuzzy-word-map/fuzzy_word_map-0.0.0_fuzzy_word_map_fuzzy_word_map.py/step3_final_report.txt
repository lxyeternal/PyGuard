{
  "purpose": "A Korean and Latin word similarity search utility using Hangul decomposition and Levenshtein distance.",
  "sources": "Input words provided to add(), find() method reading user input, internal data structures storing words and letter mappings.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; all data processed in-memory. No network, file, or system command usage.",
  "flows": "Input words are decomposed into jamo, used to find candidate words via set intersections, then similarity scores are computed between input and candidates.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a benign language utility for Korean and Latin words, decomposing Hangul characters, maintaining word sets per jamo, and computing similarity scores with Levenshtein distance. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation present. The logic is clear, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for fuzzy word matching in Korean and Latin scripts. No malicious or security issues are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, consistent with a benign in-memory processing utility.",
