{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Korean language word similarity search system supporting Hangul jamo decomposition, using Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matching.",
  "sources": "Input words provided to the add, remove, and find methods; external libraries 'Levenshtein' and 'jamo' for string processing and similarity calculations.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is transmitted to external systems, network, or stored insecurely. No untrusted data flows to dangerous functions or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input words are processed through divide_jamo, stored in internal data structures, and compared via similarity scores. No external data flow or command execution is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code uses external libraries in a straightforward manner, and the logic appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a WordMap class for managing words and their decomposed jamo representations. It adds and removes words from internal data structures, which map jamo to sets of words. The find method computes candidates via intersection of sets containing each jamo, then sorts them by Levenshtein-based similarity scores, and combines with fuzzy matches allowing one-jamo differences. The functions employ standard algorithms and external libraries without obfuscation or malicious constructs. No evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity was found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate language processing utility with no malicious intent. It relies on open-source libraries in a normal manner and performs language-based fuzzy search. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. Overall, it seems safe for use.",
