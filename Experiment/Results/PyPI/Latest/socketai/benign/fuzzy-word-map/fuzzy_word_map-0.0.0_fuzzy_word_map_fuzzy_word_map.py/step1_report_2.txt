{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Korean word search system with fuzzy matching capabilities, supporting Hangul decomposition and similarity scoring to find words with similar spellings.",
  "sources": "The code reads input words via the add() and find() methods and receives search queries through the find() method parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any sinks that process untrusted data for effects such as network communication, file manipulation, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input words are added to internal data structures; search queries are processed to find similar words based on character sets and similarity scores; no external data flow to untrusted sources occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard libraries (functools, Levenshtein, jamo) with straightforward logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a WordMap class to store words and map characters to associated words. It decomposes Hangul characters into Jamo components for flexible search. The add() method updates internal structures, while remove() manages deletions. The find() method uses set intersections to narrow candidate words, then scores similarity via Levenshtein distance. The one_miss_intersections_union() function computes unions of intersection sets to allow fuzzy matching with one missing or mismatched character. All operations are in-memory, use standard libraries, and avoid external communications. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a Korean word fuzzy search tool. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code structure and library usage are standard, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
