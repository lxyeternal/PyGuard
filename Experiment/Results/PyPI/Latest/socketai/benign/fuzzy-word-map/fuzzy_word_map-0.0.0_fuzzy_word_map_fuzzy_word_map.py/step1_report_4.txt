{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Korean word similarity search system, supporting Hangul decomposition and fuzzy matching, mainly for Korean words and some Latin characters.",
  "sources": "Reads input strings in function calls such as add() and find(), and the main block provides test inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output points that handle untrusted data beyond standard print statements, which are safe for local testing.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the main testing code into the WordMap class methods (add, find), with no external data sources or network operations involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious data handling are present. The code relies solely on standard libraries and known open-source packages (Levenshtein, jamo).",
  "analysis": "The code defines a WordMap class that manages a list of words and a mapping from decomposed Hangul characters to associated words. It allows adding and removing words, then searching for similar words based on Levenshtein distance and jamo decomposition. The functions and methods perform standard string manipulations and set operations without external input/output or network activity. The use of external packages like Levenshtein and jamo is legitimate. No obfuscation or malicious techniques are evident. The logic appears intended for Korean word similarity matching, with no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for a fuzzy Korean word search system, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses open-source libraries appropriately and contains no suspicious or harmful behavior.",
