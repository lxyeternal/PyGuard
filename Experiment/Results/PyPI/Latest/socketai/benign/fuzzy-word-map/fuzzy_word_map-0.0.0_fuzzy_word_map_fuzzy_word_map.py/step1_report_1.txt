{
  "purpose": "A Korean word similarity search tool that supports Hangul decomposition and fuzzy matching, used for finding similar words based on Levenshtein distance and jamo decomposition.",
  "sources": "The code reads input words via method calls (add, find, remove). No external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any data output functions or network operations; potential data leaks are not evident.",
  "flows": "Input words are processed through add/remove/find methods, involving jamo decomposition and similarity calculations; no external untrusted data flow outside these functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code uses standard libraries and methods with clear functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a word map for Korean and Latin characters, utilizing jamo decomposition for Hangul and Levenshtein distance for similarity scoring. It manages word storage and retrieval with set intersections to filter candidates. No external network, file, or system commands are invoked. The logic appears straightforward and legitimate for a word similarity tool, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign word similarity search utility with no indications of malicious activity or security risks. It is safe for use, with standard data processing logic and no suspicious patterns.",
