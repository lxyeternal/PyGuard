  "sources": "Environment variables, eval(), dynamic code execution, hardcoded strings, module imports.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, code execution functions, network connections, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or eval() leading to code execution or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval(), environment variables, obfuscated variable names, hardcoded strings, suspicious data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as eval() and environment variable access, which are common indicators of obfuscation or malicious intent. The presence of dynamic code execution and hardcoded strings suggests potential for malicious activity. The suspicion level varies depending on the context, but these patterns warrant a moderate to high security concern. No confirmed malicious payloads are observed, but red flags justify elevated risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious patterns such as eval() and environment variables, indicating potential malicious intent. The risk and malware scores should be adjusted upward to reflect these red flags, with obfuscation also considered. Overall, the code warrants cautious handling due to these indicators.",
