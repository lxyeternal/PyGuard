{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'fuzzy_word_map' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading package requirements, package discovery via find_packages(), reading README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly interacts with untrusted data or performs output operations that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The setup parameters are defined and used to configure the package build process; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward setup configuration. The use of open() for reading README.md is standard in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. It reads the README.md for long description content, which is common. There are no signs of code injection, malicious data handling, or obfuscated code. All operations are typical for package setup scripts and do not involve processing untrusted input or executing dynamic code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply specifies package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
