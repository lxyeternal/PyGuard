{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the Python project 'fuzzy_word_map'.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads the package description, author info, URL, and dependencies from the script itself, and also opens the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the script does not execute external commands or handle untrusted input data.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is from the static strings and the README.md file into the setup configuration; no dynamic or external input data flows into critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard setuptools functions and static data. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup script, using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads the README.md file for the long description. There are no signs of code obfuscation, malicious payloads, or external command execution. All operations are typical for package distribution configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a normal, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
