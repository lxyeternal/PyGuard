{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'fuzzy_word_map'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version, description, author, URL), dependencies ('install_requires'), and the README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external data manipulation are present.",
  "flows": "Metadata and dependencies are read from static values and a README file, with no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present. The use of open() for reading README.md is standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools to configure package installation parameters. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, license, and reads a long description from a local README.md file. There are no dynamic data inputs, external data manipulations, or code that could be malicious. The dependencies listed are common packages used for string similarity and Korean language processing, with no suspicious behavior. The code adheres to typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides package metadata and configuration, with safe practices observed.",
