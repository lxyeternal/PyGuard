  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'fuzzy_word_map' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the open() function reading 'README.md' for long_description.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the open() function reading a file, which could be manipulated if the file path or content were untrusted, but in this context, it is a static filename.",
  "flows": "Input from the open('README.md') call flows into the long_description parameter, which is used for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code appears to be standard setup script for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and other configuration. It reads the README.md file for a detailed description, which is typical for Python packages. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The dependencies specified are common libraries, and the code does not perform any network operations, data collection, or other potentially malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal package setup configuration without any malicious intent or security risks. It is used for packaging the 'fuzzy_word_map' project and does not contain malicious or sabotage code.",
