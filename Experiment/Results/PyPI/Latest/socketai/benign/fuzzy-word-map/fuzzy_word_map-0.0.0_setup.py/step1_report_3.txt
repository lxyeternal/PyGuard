{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the Python package 'fuzzy_word_map' including metadata, dependencies, and packaging information.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() function parameters, open() call for README.md file",
  "sinks": "open() function reading README.md content, which is a benign operation, and installation dependencies",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content from disk; no untrusted data flow present",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read README.md is standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. The open() call reads a local README.md file, which is a standard practice for including long descriptions. There are no dynamic code execution, data sanitization issues, or suspicious code constructs. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. It reads static files and defines package metadata; nothing suspicious or malicious is detected.",
