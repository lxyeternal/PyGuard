  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading static strings for metadata, reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; only static data and local file read, no untrusted input or external commands.",
  "flows": "Static strings and local file read; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard setup script with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for packaging, with no dynamic code execution, external commands, or malicious payloads. Dependencies are common, and the file read is standard practice. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
