{
  "purpose": "Set up a FastAPI server with an MCP (Massively Concurrent Processing) mount point for handling APIs.",
  "sources": "Import statements from fastapi and fastapi_mcp, creation of FastAPI app, API route definition, MCP mount method call.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any untrusted data handling, external network requests, or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines a server and mounts an MCP component without processing untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns observed. The usage of fastapi_mcp could be noteworthy if the library is malicious, but it is a known package for MCP integration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard FastAPI modules and a module called fastapi_mcp. It creates a FastAPI instance and defines a simple GET endpoint returning a greeting message. The MCP mount method is invoked to integrate MCP capabilities. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors. The code appears straightforward and intended for standard API server functionality with MCP support.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic FastAPI server setup with MCP mounting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The use of fastapi_mcp is standard for MCP features and does not introduce any evident security concerns.",
