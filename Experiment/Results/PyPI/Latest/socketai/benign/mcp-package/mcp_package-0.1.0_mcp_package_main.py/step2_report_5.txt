  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their findings with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `FastAPI` and `FastApiMCP`.\n- Creates a FastAPI app with a title.\n- Defines a simple GET endpoint returning a greeting.\n- Mounts MCP via `mcp.mount()`.\n\n**No untrusted data handling, external network requests, or sensitive data processing are present.** The code is straightforward, serving as a minimal API server with MCP integration.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no suspicious patterns, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no suspicious behavior, high confidence (0.9), malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code appears safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, benign usage of `FastApiMCP`, standard API setup.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, MCP mounting is standard, high confidence (1), malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, standard setup, high confidence (0.9), malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk) are consistent and reasonable.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 in some reports (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern, which is appropriate given the simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1-0.2 (low, consistent with a basic setup)\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a minimal, benign FastAPI server with MCP mounting, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (reflecting minimal security concern)\n\nThis aligns with the provided analysis and the code's straightforward nature.",
