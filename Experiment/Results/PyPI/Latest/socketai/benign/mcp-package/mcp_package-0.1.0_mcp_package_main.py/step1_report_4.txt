{
  "purpose": "Set up a FastAPI server with MCP (Mesh Central Protocol) support and expose a simple hello endpoint.",
  "sources": "FastAPI initialization, endpoint definition, MCP mount method",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling evident",
  "flows": "HTTP request received -> endpoint invoked -> response returned; MCP mount initializes internal mechanisms",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns; MCP usage appears standard",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a FastAPI app with a title, defines a single GET endpoint returning a greeting message, and mounts the MCP component for mesh communication. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious behavior, or suspicious network activity. The MCP library is invoked with default mounting, and no external data sources or sensitive information are handled within this code. The structure is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic FastAPI server with MCP integration, showing no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
