{
  "purpose": "Set up a FastAPI server with MCP (Multi-Chain Protocol) integration and expose a simple hello endpoint.",
  "sources": "Import statements for FastAPI and FastApiMCP; creation of FastAPI app; route definition; MCP mount call",
  "sinks": "Potential data exposure via the '/'' endpoint; MCP mount potentially interacts with external systems or protocols",
  "flows": "HTTP GET request to '/' can trigger response; MCP.mount() may initialize or connect to external MCP services or protocols",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior detected. Usage of FastApiMCP depends on external library behavior, but nothing inherently malicious is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a FastAPI application, adds a simple GET endpoint, and mounts MCP functionality using an external library. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or unusual data flows. The use of 'FastApiMCP' may relate to MCP protocol integration, but without malicious intent indicated by the code. The code is straightforward and typical for API setup, with no suspicious or anomalous patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears benign, setting up a basic FastAPI server with MCP support. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this snippet.",
