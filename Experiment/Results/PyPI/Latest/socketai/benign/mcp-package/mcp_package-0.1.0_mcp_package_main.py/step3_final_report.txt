  "purpose": "A simple FastAPI server with MCP mounting, serving a basic endpoint.",
  "sources": "The import statements, the FastAPI app creation, and the MCP mounting call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external network connections, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal FastAPI application with an MCP mount, serving a greeting endpoint. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of 'fastapi_mcp' appears standard. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent across reports. No modifications are necessary.",
