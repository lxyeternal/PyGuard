  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a very similar code: a FastAPI app with a single GET endpoint and a call to `mcp.mount()`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no handling of untrusted data, credentials, or network activity.\n- The `fastapi_mcp` library is a third-party package; its nature could be scrutinized, but no suspicious behavior is indicated.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and low security risks, which seem consistent given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and potential issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the reported snippets; no discrepancies.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns are present.\n- **Use of `fastapi_mcp`:** While the library's internals are not shown, mounting MCP in this context appears standard.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2  \n- **Assessment:** Justified; no malicious activity, standard usage.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Justified; minimal risk, standard code.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2  \n- **Assessment:** Justified; no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Justified; straightforward setup.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2  \n- **Assessment:** Justified; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Potential discrepancies or over/under scoring:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the code's content.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of sensitive data handling, a score of around 0.1-0.2 is appropriate. Slight variations are acceptable but do not warrant higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent across all reports.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nIf future reports involve more complex code or show signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior, scores should be adjusted accordingly. For this snippet, no changes are necessary.",
