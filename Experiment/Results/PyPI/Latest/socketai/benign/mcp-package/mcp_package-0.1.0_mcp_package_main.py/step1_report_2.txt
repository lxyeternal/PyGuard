{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a FastAPI web server with MCP (Modular Control Protocol) functionality mounted, likely to serve API endpoints related to MCP.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from HTTP GET requests to the root endpoint ('/').",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the FastAPI framework and FastApiMCP methods, which could process or expose data; however, no explicit sensitive data handling is shown.",
  "flows": "Input from incoming HTTP requests to the root endpoint is handled by the 'hello' function, which returns a static message; the 'mcp.mount()' call integrates MCP functionality, likely exposing additional endpoints or protocols.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The use of FastApiMCP's 'mount' method is standard if MCP functionality is intended; no suspicious behavior or unusual code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a FastAPI application, defines a basic GET endpoint returning a static message, and mounts MCP functionality using 'FastApiMCP'. There are no inputs from untrusted sources other than HTTP requests, and no sensitive data handling, credential management, or network connections that suggest malicious intent. The use of 'mcp.mount()' is typical for integrating MCP features. Overall, the code appears straightforward and intended for legitimate API serving.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple FastAPI server setup with MCP mounting, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a standard web API server without exposing sensitive data or performing suspicious operations.",
