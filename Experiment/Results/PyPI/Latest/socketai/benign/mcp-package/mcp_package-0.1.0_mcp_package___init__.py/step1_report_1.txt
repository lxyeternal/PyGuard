  "purpose": "The provided code appears to be a placeholder or a minimal description indicating a package related to an MCP Server.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading points are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows because the code contains only a comment line.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a comment with no executable statements, no variables, no logic, and no imports. It provides no indication of malicious intent or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal comment describing 'MCP Server package' without any functional or executable content. There are no data inputs, outputs, or logic to analyze for security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. Its simplicity suggests it is either a placeholder or documentation. Since no code or behavior is present, there is no evidence of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only a descriptive comment with no executable content. Based on this, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a non-functional placeholder or documentation note.",
