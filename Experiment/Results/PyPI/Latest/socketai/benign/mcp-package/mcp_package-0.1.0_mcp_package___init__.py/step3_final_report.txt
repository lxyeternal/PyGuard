  "purpose": "This code serves as a placeholder or documentation comment with no executable content.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only a comment string present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static comment.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, variables, or logic; minimal content, but no anomalies beyond being a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a comment or docstring with no executable code, variables, imports, or logic. No data sources, sinks, or flows are present. The content is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify this as a non-functional placeholder, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and minimal content of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder or documentation comment with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
