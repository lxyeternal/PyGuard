{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a placeholder or a very minimal documentation string indicating a 'MCP Server package'. No functional or executable code is present.",
  "sources": "No data input, environment variables, or external data sources are read or accessed.",
  "sinks": "No output, data transmission, or system modification points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow can be identified due to absence of code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a docstring without any implementation, which is unusual for a package but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a single comment string describing a 'MCP Server package'. There are no functions, classes, variables, or executable statements. Without actual code, no sources, sinks, or data flows can be analyzed. The minimal nature of this snippet suggests it is either a placeholder or an incomplete fragment. No suspicious or malicious behavior can be inferred from such a fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the minimal content, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a simple descriptive comment with no executable or harmful elements.",
