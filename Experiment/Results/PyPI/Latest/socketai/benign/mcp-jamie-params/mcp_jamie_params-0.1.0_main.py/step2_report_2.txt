  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content**: The code is extremely simple:\n```python\ndef main():\n    print(\"Hello from mcp-jamie-params!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nIt only prints a static message and has no external dependencies, inputs, or network activity.\n\n2. **Report Summaries**:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and performs only a static print operation.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The purpose is to print a greeting message.\n- No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n- **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n- **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Security Risk**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Issues**:\n- The only element that might be considered noteworthy is the string `'mcp-jamie-params'`. However, it appears to be a placeholder or identifier, not malicious.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Score Justification**:\n- The malware score should remain 0; there's no indication of malicious intent.\n- The obfuscated score should remain 0; the code is clear.\n- The overall security risk should be 0; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all evidence points to benign code.\n- The code's purpose and behavior are transparent.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code and the reports' findings.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a simple, benign script that outputs a static message. All reports correctly identify no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
