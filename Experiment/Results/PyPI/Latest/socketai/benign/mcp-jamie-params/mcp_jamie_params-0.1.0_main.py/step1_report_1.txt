  "purpose": "The code is designed to print a greeting message to the console.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the standard output (console) via print().",
  "flows": "No external data flows are present; the flow is simple execution of main() which calls print().",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors. The message 'mcp-jamie-params' appears benign but is the only potentially noteworthy element; it might be a placeholder or identifier.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal, consisting of a main() function that prints a static message and an entry point check. It does not perform any data processing, input/output beyond printing, or external network activity. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, benign, and contains no malicious behavior. It only outputs a static message when executed. There are no security risks or anomalies detected.",
