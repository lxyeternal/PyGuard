  "purpose": "A minimal Python script that prints a static greeting message.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from no external sources; it only contains a print statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs beyond the static print message; no data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code simply executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a main() function that prints a static message and executes it if run as the main module. It involves no external input, network activity, or data processing. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code. No anomalies or suspicious elements are present, and the code's purpose is clear and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate and consistent, and the scores reflect the code's harmless nature. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
