  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module component called NevadaConverter, which is a standard import statement in Python. It does not include any data handling, external network operations, or suspicious behavior. Since this is only a single line, no source-to-sink flows or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears normal and benign, assuming the local module and its contents are safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard practice for code organization and does not raise security concerns based solely on this snippet.",
