  "purpose": "Importing the NevadaConverter class from a local module named converter.",
  "sources": "The code reads a local module file 'converter.py' to import NevadaConverter.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or external output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing; simply an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a straightforward import statement with no additional code or logic. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "This snippet performs a standard import of a class from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The code does not invoke any untrusted sources, or execute any code dynamically. The import appears to be a normal part of a larger codebase. As this is only an import statement, it offers limited context but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a standard code structure. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
