{
  "purpose": "The function validates that all specified required columns are present in a pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'df' (pandas DataFrame) and 'required_columns' (list of column names).",
  "sinks": "The code raises an exception with a message that includes missing column names if validation fails.",
  "flows": "Input 'df' and 'required_columns' are used to determine missing columns; if any are missing, a ValueError is raised with details.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; straightforward validation logic. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for missing columns by comparing 'required_columns' against 'df.columns'. If missing columns are found, it raises a ValueError with a message listing them. The function is simple, standard validation for data integrity. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for DataFrame validation with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs safe validation and error reporting without security risks.",
