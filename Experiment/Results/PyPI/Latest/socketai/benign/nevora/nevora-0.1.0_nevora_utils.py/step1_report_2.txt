  "purpose": "The function validates that all specified required columns are present in a pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "The code reads input DataFrame 'df' and the list 'required_columns'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or effects; it only raises an exception if columns are missing.",
  "flows": "The source data 'df' and 'required_columns' are checked; if columns are missing, a ValueError is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, validating DataFrame columns. It uses list comprehension to identify missing columns and raises an exception if needed. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious logic present. It is standard validation code without hidden intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple validation task without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and standard.",
