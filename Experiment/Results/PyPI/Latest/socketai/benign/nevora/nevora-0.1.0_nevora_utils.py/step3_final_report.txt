  "purpose": "Validate that all required columns exist in a pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame's columns attribute.",
  "sinks": "Raising ValueError when missing columns are detected.",
  "flows": "Checking required columns against df.columns, raising exception if missing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward validation logic with no suspicious code or side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple validation by comparing a list of required columns with the DataFrame's columns. It constructs a list of missing columns and raises an exception if any are absent. No obfuscation, malicious code, or external interactions are present. The logic is standard and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function for DataFrame validation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code's purpose is straightforward, and the implementation is correct and safe.",
