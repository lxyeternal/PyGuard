  "purpose": "Validate that specified required columns exist in a pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame `df`, list `required_columns`.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from `df` and `required_columns` into the validation logic, primarily in list comprehension and conditional check.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard validation without unusual or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to check for the presence of required columns in a DataFrame, raising an error if missing. It uses a straightforward list comprehension and conditional statement. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code's logic is simple and intended solely for data validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for DataFrame validation with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
