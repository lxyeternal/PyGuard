  "purpose": "Convert raw sales and return data into Nevada chart format with optional time bucketing.",
  "sources": "sale_col, return_col, quantity_col, time_bucket, pandas functions (to_datetime, dt.to_period, pivot_table)",
  "sinks": "DataFrame manipulation within pandas, no external data or network operations",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> optional time bucketing -> pivot table creation",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward data transformation with no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class NevadaConverter that applies optional time bucketing to date columns and pivots data to a specific format. It uses standard pandas functions safely, with no external I/O, code execution, or security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is clear, and the operations are typical for data processing tasks. The code does not handle untrusted input in a way that introduces vulnerabilities, nor does it perform any network or file operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data transformation utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
