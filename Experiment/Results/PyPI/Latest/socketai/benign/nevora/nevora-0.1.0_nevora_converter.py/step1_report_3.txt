{
  "purpose": "Convert raw sales and returns data into Nevada chart format by bucketing and pivoting data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input DataFrame (df), including columns specified by sale_col, return_col, and quantity_col.",
  "sinks": "Data is transformed within the DataFrame; no data is written to external sources, network, or files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrame through bucketing (_apply_time_bucketing) and pivoting (to_nevada_format).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. Uses standard pandas operations for data transformation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for transforming sales data, with methods for time bucketing and pivoting. It uses pandas functions like to_datetime, dt.to_period, and pivot_table. No untrusted input handling vulnerabilities or suspicious code patterns detected. The implementation appears straightforward and consistent with standard data processing. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data transformation utility with no malicious or suspicious elements. It performs data bucketing and pivoting for sales data, and there are no indications of malware, backdoors, or security issues.",
