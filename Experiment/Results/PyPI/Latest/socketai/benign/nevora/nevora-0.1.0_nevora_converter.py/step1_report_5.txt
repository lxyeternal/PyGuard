{
  "purpose": "Convert raw sales and returns data into Nevada chart format with optional time bucketing.",
  "sources": "Reads input DataFrame and its specified columns (sale_col, return_col, quantity_col).",
  "sinks": "No data is sent over the network, written to files, or processed in a way that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> _apply_time_bucketing (if enabled) -> pivot_table transformation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a class with configuration for processing sales data, applies optional time bucketing, and creates a pivot table for data analysis. It uses standard pandas functions and adheres to typical data processing patterns without any suspicious or malicious behavior. The code does not perform any network communication, file access beyond in-memory data manipulation, or secret handling. No anomalies or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data processing utility for transforming sales data. It contains no malware, no malicious behavior, and poses no security risks. It appears to be a benign component intended for data formatting.",
