{
  "purpose": "The code converts raw sales and returns data into a specific format suitable for Nevada charts by applying time bucketing and pivoting the data.",
  "sources": "DataFrame input in to_nevada_format method; column values in self.sale_col, self.return_col, self.quantity_col; data read through pandas library functions.",
  "sinks": "Pivot table creation and date conversion functions, which are standard pandas operations; no direct data leaks or unsafe operations observed.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> _apply_time_bucketing (date conversions) -> pivot_table (data aggregation) -> output DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code uses standard pandas methods; no dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for data transformation, focusing on converting and aggregating sales data. The use of pandas functions is standard and safe. No input/output sources are vulnerable; no data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The functions perform typical data processing tasks without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data transformation utility with no malicious intent or security issues. It securely processes input data without any suspicious operations or hidden behaviors.",
