  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'nevora' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package description from 'README.md' via open('README.md').read().",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform potentially dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "The flow is from reading 'README.md' content to assigning it to 'long_description'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected. The script performs standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and dependencies. The only file read operation is to include the README content for long_description, which is common practice. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious imports, or suspicious code behaviors. The code structure and content are typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
