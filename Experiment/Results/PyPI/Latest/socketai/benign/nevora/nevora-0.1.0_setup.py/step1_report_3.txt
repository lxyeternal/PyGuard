  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'nevora' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, reading README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' and passing package info to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of setuptools without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with package details. It reads 'README.md' for long description, which is standard practice. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used dynamically at runtime. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is clean and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It functions solely to define package metadata and dependencies.",
