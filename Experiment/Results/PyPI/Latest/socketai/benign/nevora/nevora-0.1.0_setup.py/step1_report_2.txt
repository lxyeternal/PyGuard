  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for the Python package 'nevora'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version, author info), the README.md file for long description, and the list of dependencies (pandas).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not execute untrusted input or perform network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Reads package info and description, uses find_packages() to gather modules, and installs dependencies; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows standard setup.py structure without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration script for packaging a Python project. It reads static metadata, dependencies, and a README file, then calls setup() with this information. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. It uses standard functions and straightforward parameters without user input or environment variable manipulation. The code's structure and content are consistent with legitimate packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a normal, benign setup configuration script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
