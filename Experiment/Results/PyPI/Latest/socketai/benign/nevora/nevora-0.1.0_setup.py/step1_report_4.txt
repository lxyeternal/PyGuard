  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'nevora' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, and importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly sends data over network, writes to system files, or executes untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flows involving untrusted sources; mainly static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It reads the README.md file to set the long description, defines package dependencies, and includes metadata. There are no dynamic executions, network communications, or handling of untrusted input. The code appears straightforward and typical for package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is benign and follows common packaging practices. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
