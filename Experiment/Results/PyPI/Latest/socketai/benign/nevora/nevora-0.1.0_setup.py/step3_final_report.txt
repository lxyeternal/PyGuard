  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and description.",
  "sources": "Reading static metadata, dependencies list, and the README.md file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or user input processed.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from file reads (README.md) into package description; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with placeholder author info and URL, which are typical in template scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads static metadata, dependencies, and a README file without any dynamic data, user input, or network operations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The code's simplicity and standard structure indicate no security risks or malicious intent. The placeholder author and URL are not malicious but could be improved for clarity. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no security issues or malicious behavior. The scores are justified and should remain as is.",
