The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is low (~0.1-0.2) due to the environment variable handling issue. Correcting the environment variable access will improve correctness but not security."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility wrapper for 'bcp' with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and malware scores are zero. The primary concern is ensuring that if 'command_args' are influenced externally, proper sanitization should be enforced. As-is, the code is safe and suitable for use."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests with no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score around 0.1 to 0.2 due to environment manipulation but no actual malicious activity."
