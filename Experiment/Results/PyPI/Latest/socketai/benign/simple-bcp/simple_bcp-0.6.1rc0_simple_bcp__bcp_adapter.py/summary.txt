  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility wrapper for 'bcp' with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and malware scores are zero. The primary concern is ensuring that if 'command_args' are influenced externally, proper sanitization should be enforced. As-is, the code is safe and suitable for use."
