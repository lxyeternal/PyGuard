  "purpose": "A wrapper for the 'bcp' utility that locates the executable, retrieves its version, and executes commands with validated paths.",
  "sources": "Path validation, subprocess call with command arguments",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution with command arguments",
  "flows": "Path validation -> Version retrieval -> Command execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with proper validation",
  "analysis": "The code validates the executable path, retrieves version info via subprocess, and executes commands with controlled arguments. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The main security consideration is potential command injection if 'command_args' are influenced by untrusted sources, but in the current implementation, arguments are passed explicitly and are assumed safe. The subprocess calls are made with validated paths and arguments, minimizing injection risk. Logging is used for debugging but does not introduce security issues. Overall, the code is a standard, safe wrapper with minimal attack surface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility wrapper for 'bcp' with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and malware scores are zero. The primary concern is ensuring that if 'command_args' are influenced externally, proper sanitization should be enforced. As-is, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
