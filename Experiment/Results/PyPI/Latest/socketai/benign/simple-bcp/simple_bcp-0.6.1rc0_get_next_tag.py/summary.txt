  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version bumping utility with a minor bug in environment variable usage. It does not pose a supply chain or security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is low (~0.1-0.2) due to the environment variable handling issue. Correcting the environment variable access will improve correctness but not security."
