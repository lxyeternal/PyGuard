{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to determine the next version tag for a Git repository, specifically handling version bumping based on commit messages and current tags.",
  "sources": "Reads data from subprocess outputs (git commands), environment variables, and the current version string.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the next version tag string, potentially influenced by environment variables.",
  "flows": "Subprocess output is parsed and used to determine version bumps, with environment variable influencing the final tag format.",
  "anomalies": "Uses subprocess.run and subprocess.check_output without sanitization of external inputs, but this is standard for such scripts. Environment variable '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH' is used without validation, which could influence version tag output, but not maliciously. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs version management based on git tags and commit messages, utilizing subprocess calls to gather data. It processes commit logs to detect version bump types, then adjusts version numbers accordingly. The environment variable influences the tag suffix, potentially for CI/CD purposes. No suspicious code patterns, malicious behavior, or sabotage are evident. The code relies on external tools (git, semver) and standard environment variables, which are common in CI pipelines. There are no indications of backdoors, data theft, or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward version bumping utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It operates within expected parameters for such a script and does not contain any malicious or obfuscated code.",
