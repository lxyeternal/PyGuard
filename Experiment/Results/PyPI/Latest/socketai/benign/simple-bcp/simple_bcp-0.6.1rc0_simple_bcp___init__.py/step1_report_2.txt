{
  "purpose": "The code exports a class named BCPAdapter from a relative module, likely for use in a larger package or system.",
  "sources": "The code reads from an internal module '_bcp_adapter' to import BCPAdapter.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The import statement indicates a straightforward import flow from a local module; no data flow or processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "This code solely imports a class from a local module and defines an export list. It performs no data processing, network operations, or external interactions. The presence of a relative import from '_bcp_adapter' suggests internal module usage. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export statement with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be a standard part of a package setup.",
