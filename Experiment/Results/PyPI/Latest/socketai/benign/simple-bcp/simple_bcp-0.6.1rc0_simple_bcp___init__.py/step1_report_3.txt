  "purpose": "The code defines a module that exports a class named BCPAdapter for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '._bcp_adapter'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "Import from '_bcp_adapter' leads to the exported list containing 'BCPAdapter'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a local module and exports it as part of the public API. There are no data processing, network operations, or any other actions that could indicate malicious intent. It appears to be a standard module setup for exposing a class.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward module export with no suspicious elements.",
