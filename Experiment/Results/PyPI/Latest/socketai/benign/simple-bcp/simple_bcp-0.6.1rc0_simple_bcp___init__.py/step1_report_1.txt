  "purpose": "Defines a module exporting the BCPAdapter class for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports BCPAdapter from a local module '_bcp_adapter'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "The module imports BCPAdapter; no data flow is explicitly shown.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious or unusual constructs; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing a class from a relative module and exposing it via __all__. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are evident. The code structure is standard and does not include any obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setup for exporting a class. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
