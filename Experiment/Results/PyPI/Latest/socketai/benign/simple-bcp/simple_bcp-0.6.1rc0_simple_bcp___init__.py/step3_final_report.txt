  "purpose": "Module exporting the BCPAdapter class from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._bcp_adapter, no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Import of BCPAdapter from local module, then exposure via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and exposes it via __all__, following standard Python module practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or contain secrets. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
