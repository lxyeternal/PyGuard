  "purpose": "Export the BCPAdapter class from the current package module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing BCPAdapter from a local module (_bcp_adapter).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only performs a static import and declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no apparent anomalies or suspicious patterns. The import source is local, and no dynamic execution or embedded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and defines an export list. There is no runtime data processing, no external data input, and no suspicious or unusual behavior. The simplicity indicates standard module export behavior without hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module export statement with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is typical in Python packages to re-export classes for external use.",
