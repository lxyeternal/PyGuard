{
  "purpose": "To define and configure package metadata for the 'piauthorizer' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata such as name, version, author, and description.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sources or sinks; the setup function does not process user input or external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely specifies static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with predefined package metadata. No dynamic code, user input, or external data handling is present. All data used is hardcoded and static, serving standard package configuration purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to provide package metadata and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
