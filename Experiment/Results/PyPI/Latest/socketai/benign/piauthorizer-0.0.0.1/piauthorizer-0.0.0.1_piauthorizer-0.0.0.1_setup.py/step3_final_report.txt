  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution, including name, version, description, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Static strings assigned to setup() parameters: name, version, author, author_email, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sources are used.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data used solely for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields; unconventional version number '0.0.0.1'.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static, hardcoded package metadata. No dynamic input, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The empty author fields are placeholders, not malicious. The version number is unconventional but not harmful. All reports correctly identify the script as benign with no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The empty author fields are placeholders and do not pose security concerns. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
