  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution via setuptools",
  "sources": "Setuptools setup() function call, package metadata fields",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "N/A, static package metadata",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields, but not necessarily malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() to specify package metadata such as name, version, description, and classifiers. All fields appear standard and safe. The author and author_email fields are left blank, which is unusual but not malicious. No code execution, input handling, or external data interactions are present. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The package appears to be a placeholder with no harmful intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with placeholder values. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
