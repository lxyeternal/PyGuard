  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python package code for malicious behavior and security risks.",
  "sources": "Data read from environment variables, external modules imported, and user input (if any).",
  "sinks": "Potential data transmission functions, system command executions, or file operations that could leak data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through intermediate processing to sinks like network transmission, file modification, or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, unusual imports, or dynamic code execution observed. No hidden backdoors or malicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and performs typical operations. It reads environment variables and uses them in a standard manner. No indications of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, remote connections, or damaging system commands. The flow appears to be legitimate data processing without suspicious patterns. No anomalies like obfuscated code or hidden behavior were found. The code structure is straightforward, with clear intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign open-source component performing standard operations. Confidence is high that there is no malicious intent or security concern within this code snippet.",
