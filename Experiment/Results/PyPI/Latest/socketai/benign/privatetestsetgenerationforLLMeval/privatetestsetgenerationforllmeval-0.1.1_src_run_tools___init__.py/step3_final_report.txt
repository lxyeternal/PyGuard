{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be benign, performing standard operations such as reading environment variables and executing typical functions without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing standard libraries, executing functions normally",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no data leaks or malicious actions observed",
  "flows": "Standard data flow from environment variables to application logic without suspicious transformations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries and practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The high confidence score (0.9) supports a benign assessment. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present. The code's structure and operations are typical for legitimate applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The low malware (0), obfuscated (0), and security risk (0.2) scores are justified given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
