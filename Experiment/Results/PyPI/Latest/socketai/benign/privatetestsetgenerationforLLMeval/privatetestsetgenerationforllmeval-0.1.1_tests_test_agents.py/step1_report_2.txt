{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for agents' functions in a Python project, verifying behavior with mock data.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or untrusted data inputs are read; test data is simulated within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network calls, file writes, or database operations are present; output assertions are made within the test framework.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only invokes functions with controlled mock data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The code consists of straightforward unit tests.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard testing libraries and relevant modules, modifies sys.path for module importation, and defines simple test cases. It calls two functions with minimal mock data and asserts expected return values. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. The code is typical for a test suite and does not include network activity, file manipulation, or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard unit testing script with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It performs simple validation of functions under controlled mock conditions, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
