  "purpose": "Unit tests for functions 'privacy_agent' and 'synthetic_data_generator' using mock data.",
  "sources": "Controlled mock input data within test functions; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions; outputs are string assertions; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard imports and minimal mock data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard Python unittest suite testing specific functions with controlled, mock inputs. It does not process external or untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain suspicious patterns. The code structure and logic are typical for testing purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The environment is controlled, and the functions are invoked with predictable inputs, leading to expected outputs. No anomalies or suspicious signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The environment and code behavior do not indicate any supply chain security threat.",
