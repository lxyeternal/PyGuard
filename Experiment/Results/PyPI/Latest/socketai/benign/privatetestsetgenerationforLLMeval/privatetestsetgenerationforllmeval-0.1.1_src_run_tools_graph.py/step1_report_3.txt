{
  "purpose": "Define and create a state graph workflow for data processing agents including diversity augmentation, privacy, and synthetic data generation.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing', 'langgraph.graph', and 'agents' modules; function parameters and local variables; agent modules imported and used within the workflow.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, no network or file operations; workflow nodes invoke external agents which could contain sinks, but code does not reveal such behavior directly.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into 'diversity' agent, then to 'privacy' agent, then to 'synthesis' agent, and finally terminates at 'END'.",
  "anomalies": "Commented out code related to privacy analysis stage suggests potential incomplete or intentionally omitted steps; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures; standard use of library classes and methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a workflow using a StateGraph class, adding nodes representing different data processing agents. The workflow structure is straightforward, with clearly defined input and output stages. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior indicators are present. The code relies on external agent modules which could contain malicious code, but within this snippet, the code appears benign and purpose-focused on workflow orchestration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical workflow setup for data processing using modular agents. No malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident in this code snippet. The commented-out code hints at potential future or alternative workflow stages but does not impact current security posture.",
