{
  "purpose": "Define and create a workflow graph for data processing using various agents including diversity augmentation, privacy, and synthetic data generation.",
  "sources": "Code imports modules and classes; no external input sources or data read operations are explicitly present.",
  "sinks": "Nodes such as diversity_augmenting_agent, privacy_agent, and synthetic_data_generator may process or generate data, but no untrusted data sinks or data exfiltration mechanisms are explicitly visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'diversity' to 'privacy', then to 'synthesis', and finally to END via set edges, following a clear pipeline structure.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with standard use of classes and method calls; no suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for agent states and constructs a workflow graph connecting different data processing agents. The workflow setup appears standard, with comments indicating possible future extensions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden data manipulation is present. The modules and agents used are not shown in detail, but their usage here appears to be typical for orchestrating a data processing pipeline. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this module, such as data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a data processing workflow with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions as an orchestrator for different data processing agents without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
