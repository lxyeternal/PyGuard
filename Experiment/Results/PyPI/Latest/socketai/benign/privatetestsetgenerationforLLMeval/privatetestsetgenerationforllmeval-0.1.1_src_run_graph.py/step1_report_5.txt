  "purpose": "Define and create a data processing workflow involving multiple agents for data augmentation, privacy, and synthesis.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; references to imported agents and internal function calls.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "Flow from 'diversity' agent to 'privacy' agent to 'synthesis' agent, ending at workflow completion.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code sections for 'privacy_analysis' that are not used; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets present; no obfuscated or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a workflow pipeline using the 'langgraph' library, setting up nodes for data processing agents. No input or output data handling, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure appears standard for orchestrating agent workflows. The commented-out sections suggest possible modifications but do not introduce malicious behavior. The code does not contain any suspicious data flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard workflow setup without malicious intent or security risks. No malware, backdoors, or suspicious activities are evident.",
