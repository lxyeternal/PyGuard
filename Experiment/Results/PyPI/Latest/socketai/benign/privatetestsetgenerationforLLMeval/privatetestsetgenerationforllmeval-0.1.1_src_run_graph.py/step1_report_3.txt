{
  "purpose": "Define and create a workflow graph for data processing involving diversity augmentation, privacy analysis, and synthetic data generation.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; references to imported modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; workflow nodes invoke external agents that may process data, but details are abstracted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'diversity' node to 'privacy' node, then to 'synthesis', and finally to workflow end.",
  "anomalies": "Code structure is straightforward with commented-out lines and standard class definitions; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a directed graph workflow for data processing using external agent functions. There are no indications of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The external agents are imported modules with assumed legitimate functions. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious data flows are evident. Comments suggest potential additional steps, but these are commented out and do not affect current behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to define a data processing pipeline without any malicious intent or suspicious activities. It relies on external modules which are not provided, but the visible code does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks.",
