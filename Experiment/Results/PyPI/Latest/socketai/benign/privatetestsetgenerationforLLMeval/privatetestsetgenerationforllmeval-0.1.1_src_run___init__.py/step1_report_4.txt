  "purpose": "Analyze the code for malicious behavior, security risks, and obfuscation, focusing on supply chain security issues.",
  "sources": "Input reading occurs at any variable assignments from functions like input(), reading environment variables, or external data sources. Specific sources are not present in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write/read operations, subprocess calls, or eval/exec functions. No such sinks are evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No clear data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code does not process external inputs or perform data transmission based on the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns detected. The code appears straightforward without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, including beginning, middle, and end sections. No malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security flaws were identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard, and no obfuscation or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be benign with no evident supply chain threats or malicious intent.",
