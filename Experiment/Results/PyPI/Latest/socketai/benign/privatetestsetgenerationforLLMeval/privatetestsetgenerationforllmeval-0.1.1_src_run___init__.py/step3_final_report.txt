{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python package intended for data processing, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "sources": "Input data from user, environment variables, files, or network sources; no suspicious or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "sinks": "Standard output, network connections, or file writes; no untrusted data flows leading to security issues identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output or network sinks; no anomalous source-to-sink paths detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious strings observed; code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is typical for data processing tasks, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The absence of suspicious control flow, obfuscated variables, or dynamic execution suggests benign intent. The security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is minimal. The confidence score is high due to the straightforward nature of the code and lack of suspicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The security risk and malware scores are set to 0, consistent with the analysis. Obfuscation is absent, and the overall threat level is low.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
