{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from a local module named 'inference', likely part of a larger inference or machine learning pipeline.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module '.inference', which is a source of code dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet; it does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only imports classes without executing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import from a local module, with no runtime behavior, data leaks, or external network interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of malware and obfuscation set to 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these assessments. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected, and the code aligns with standard Python practices for modular design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The overall security risk is negligible, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
