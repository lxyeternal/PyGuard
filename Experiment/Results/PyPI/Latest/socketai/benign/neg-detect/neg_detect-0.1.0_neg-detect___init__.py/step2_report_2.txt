  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .inference import Pipeline, CueBertInference, ScopeBertInference\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. Report 1\n- **Summary:** The import is standard; no malicious behavior, low security risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis report correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward import statement. The security risk score of 0.1 seems slightly high given the simplicity, but it might be a conservative default. The malware score of 0 is appropriate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Report 2\n- **Summary:** Standard import, no anomalies, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a very accurate and cautious assessment. The code is minimal and typical. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Report 3\n- **Summary:** Standard import, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent with the code snippet. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Report 4\n- **Summary:** Import from local module, no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Report 5\n- **Summary:** Import statement, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple, benign import statement.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are very low or zero, consistent with the minimal code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- Since the code is a straightforward import with no signs of malicious behavior, I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (a very conservative default, but could be zero given the context)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are thorough and cautious, which is good practice.\n- No signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present in this minimal snippet.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe overall assessment is that this code is safe, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. The scores are appropriate and consistent across reports.",
