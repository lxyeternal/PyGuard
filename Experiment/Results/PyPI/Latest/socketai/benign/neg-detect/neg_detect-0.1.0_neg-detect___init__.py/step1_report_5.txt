{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes related to inference pipelines, likely for NLP or machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.inference'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow; just imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing three classes from a local module. It does not include data processing, external network calls, or other suspicious behavior. Since it is a minimal import statement, there is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior in this snippet. The classes imported may be part of an inference pipeline, but their implementation is not shown here. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a larger project where these classes are used later.",
