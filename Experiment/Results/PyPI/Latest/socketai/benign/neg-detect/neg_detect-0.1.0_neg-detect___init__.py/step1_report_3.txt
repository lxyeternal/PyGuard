{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes (Pipeline, CueBertInference, ScopeBertInference) from a local module named 'inference'. Its purpose appears to be setting up or utilizing inference pipelines, likely for natural language processing or similar tasks.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or network operations in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports classes; there are no data flows or untrusted data paths demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The snippet consists solely of an import statement from a relative module, which is standard practice in Python for modular code organization. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. The classes imported suggest the package may perform inference or machine learning tasks, but nothing in this code indicates malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a normal part of a Python project structure.",
