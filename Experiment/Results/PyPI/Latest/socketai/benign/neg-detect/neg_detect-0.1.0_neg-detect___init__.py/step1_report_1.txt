{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes from a module named 'inference', likely for performing inference tasks in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from a relative module 'inference'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks are evident in this snippet; it only imports classes.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows within this minimal code snippet; it merely imports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and typical of module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a local module, indicating intended use of 'Pipeline', 'CueBertInference', and 'ScopeBertInference'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, obfuscated code, or malicious side effects. The snippet is very minimal, offering limited context, but nothing suspicious is evident in this import statement.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger application that utilizes the imported classes for inference tasks. The overall security risk is very low.",
