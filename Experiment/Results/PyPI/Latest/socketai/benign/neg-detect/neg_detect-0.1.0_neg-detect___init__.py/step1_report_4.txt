{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes from a module named 'inference' which appears to be related to some form of inference or machine learning pipeline.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the module '.inference' within the same package/directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks in this snippet; no data is processed or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported classes ('Pipeline', 'CueBertInference', 'ScopeBertInference') in the inference module, but no runtime flow is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The snippet only contains import statements, which are typical for module setup. Without additional context or usage, there are no signs of malicious behavior. The import suggests the module may relate to inference models, possibly NLP or ML models, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement importing classes from a local module, with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of a larger system, likely for inference tasks, but nothing suspicious is evident here.",
