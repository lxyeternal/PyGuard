{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes (Pipeline, CueBertInference, ScopeBertInference) from a local module named 'inference', likely used for machine learning inference tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.inference' which is part of the package's codebase.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; it only performs an import statement.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the local module to the current namespace via import; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. Importing classes from a local module is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "This snippet is a straightforward import statement importing three classes from a relative module named 'inference'. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The import does not involve external data, network connections, or dynamic code execution. Given its simplicity, it appears to be part of a larger machine learning or inference pipeline. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is typical for modular Python projects using relative imports.",
