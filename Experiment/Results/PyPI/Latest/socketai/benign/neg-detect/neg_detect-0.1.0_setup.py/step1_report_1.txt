{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'neg-detect', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "open('README.md').read() for long description, hardcoded strings for package metadata, and find_packages() for discovering package modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Read from 'README.md' during setup, use hardcoded metadata to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard setup tools with typical parameters and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard Python package setup using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for long description, specifies package metadata such as name, version, author, email, URL, and dependencies. There are no dynamic or external inputs that could be malicious, nor are there any suspicious behaviors like network calls, file manipulations, or code execution. All dependencies are typical for machine learning projects. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior. It simply configures package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
