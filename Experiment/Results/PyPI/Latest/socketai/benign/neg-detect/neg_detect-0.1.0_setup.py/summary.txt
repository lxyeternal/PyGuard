  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriate as zero. The only minor issue is the potential for a runtime error if 'README.md' is missing, but this does not constitute a security concern."
