  "purpose": "A standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, static metadata fields, dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static configuration with no user input or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration data assigned to setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open('README.md').read()' without exception handling; email address appears unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging Python modules. It does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted input. The only minor concern is the lack of exception handling when reading 'README.md', which could cause runtime errors if the file is missing. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are present. The metadata and dependencies are standard for a ML-related package. The email address appears unconventional but not malicious. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriate as zero. The only minor issue is the potential for a runtime error if 'README.md' is missing, but this does not constitute a security concern.",
