  "purpose": "Configure and package a Python module for negation detection using BERT, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is from reading the 'README.md' file into the long_description parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code present. The email address appears unusual but is not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads the README.md for the long description, which is typical. The dependencies are straightforward, with no user input handling or network operations. The email address looks unusual but not malicious. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard packaging tasks without any suspicious elements.",
