  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'neg-detect' with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data processing or network calls present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no untrusted data flow from sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of 'open('README.md').read()' without exception handling may cause errors if the file is missing, but this is not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It imports setup utilities, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The 'open' function reads the README file for long description, which is common practice. No input from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, no network activity or sensitive data handling. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal package setup configuration without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any unsafe operations or handle sensitive data insecurely.",
