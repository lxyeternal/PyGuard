  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'neg-detect', which includes package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, package discovery via find_packages(), reading package metadata from setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is written or executed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only static configuration data is used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code follows standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata, including name, version, description, author info, URL, dependencies, classifiers, and Python version requirement. It reads 'README.md' for long description, which is a common practice. All data appears static and well-structured. No code injection, dynamic execution, or suspicious code elements are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any malicious actions or insecure operations.",
