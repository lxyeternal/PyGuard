  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without further context or comments, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and potentially from external sources such as files or network (if present, though not visible here).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network calls, file writes, or database queries (if present), especially if untrusted data is used without sanitization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or parameters through internal variables, potentially reaching system or network functions, which could be exploited if untrusted data is used insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are apparent from the provided code snippet. However, without seeing the complete code, some suspicious patterns cannot be ruled out.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and appears straightforward, with no evident malicious behavior or obfuscation. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or dangerous use of environment variables. No suspicious or hardcoded secrets are observed. The structure is clear, with standard Python syntax. Without additional context or full code, the likelihood of malicious intent remains low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, though a more complete review could provide additional assurance.",
