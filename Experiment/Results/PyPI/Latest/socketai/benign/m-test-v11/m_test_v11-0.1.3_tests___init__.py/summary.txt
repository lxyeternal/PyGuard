  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risk. Report 3's obfuscation and dynamic features suggest higher suspicion; increasing its malware score from 0.2 to 0.4 improves alignment with observed indicators. Overall, the assessments are consistent, but cautious review of obfuscated code is recommended."
