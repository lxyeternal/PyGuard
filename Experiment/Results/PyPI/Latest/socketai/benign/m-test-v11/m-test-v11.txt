      "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code with no malicious intent, justified by their low scores and high confidence. Report 5 presents moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and complex data flows, warranting further review. The overall security posture is low risk but warrants caution due to the suspicious patterns identified in Report 5."

      "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risk. Report 3's obfuscation and dynamic features suggest higher suspicion; increasing its malware score from 0.2 to 0.4 improves alignment with observed indicators. Overall, the assessments are consistent, but cautious review of obfuscated code is recommended."
