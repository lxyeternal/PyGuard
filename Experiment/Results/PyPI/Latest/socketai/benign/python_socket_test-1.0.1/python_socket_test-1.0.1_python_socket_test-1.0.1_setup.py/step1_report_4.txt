{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'python_socket_test', including package discovery, metadata, and console script entry point.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description, calling find_packages() for package discovery, defining entry point for console script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is being written or executed from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context manager for reading 'README.md' may cause resource leaks, but not malicious. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines package metadata, reads a description file, and specifies a console script entry point. No execution of untrusted data, no code injection, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The open() call for 'README.md' is standard in setup scripts, though better practice would involve a context manager. Overall, the code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily facilitates package installation and entry point setup.",
