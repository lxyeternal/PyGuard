  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'python_socket_test', including package discovery and entry point definition.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setuptools for setup operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows identified; setup functions are standard and do not handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; setup parameters are static or file-based initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. Use of open() without validation is typical in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file for packaging a Python project. It uses setuptools to configure package metadata, discover packages, and define a console script entry point. The open() call reads the README.md for the long description, which is common practice. No code manipulates or evaluates untrusted input, no network or malicious code is present, and no obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
