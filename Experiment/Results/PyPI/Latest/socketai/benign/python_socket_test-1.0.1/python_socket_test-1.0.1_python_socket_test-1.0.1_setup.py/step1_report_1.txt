{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the python_socket_test package, including package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description; find_packages() to identify packages; no other data sources present.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup process is static and configuration-based.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Use of open() to read README.md is standard, assuming the file is safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It reads the long description from a markdown file and specifies package details, classifiers, Python version requirements, and a console script entry point. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, code obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The script appears to be a typical setup configuration with no suspicious components or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a standard package configuration with no detectable malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up package metadata and entry points.",
