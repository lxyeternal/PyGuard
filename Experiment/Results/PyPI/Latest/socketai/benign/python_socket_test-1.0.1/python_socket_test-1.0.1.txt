      "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no malicious or security issues. The analysis confirms the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor improvements could include adding exception handling for file operations, but this does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe and typical for Python packaging."
