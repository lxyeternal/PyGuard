  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n**Code snippet:**  \n```python\n\"\"\"Wilma CLI.\"\"\"\n```\n\n**Summary of findings from reports:**  \n- All reports identify the code as only a comment or docstring describing \"Wilma CLI\" with no executable code, imports, functions, or data handling.  \n- No input sources, sinks, or data flows are present.  \n- No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are detected.  \n- The confidence levels are generally high (0.8 to 1), reflecting certainty that this is just documentation or placeholder content.  \n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The code is only a docstring; **no issues are present** in the code itself.  \n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning errors:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; they correctly identify the code as non-executable documentation.  \n- No flawed reasoning or assumptions are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are all zero, which is appropriate given the content.  \n- The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty in the assessment.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- **Not applicable** here, as the code is harmless and contains no malicious or risky elements.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Correctly set to 0; no malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- Any claim that this minimal snippet could be malicious would be unfounded; the assessments are justified.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the extremely minimal content, I agree with the reports' conclusions that this code snippet is purely documentation with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code snippet is a placeholder or documentation comment for \"Wilma CLI\" with no executable logic or security implications. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final note:**  \nIf this is representative of the entire codebase, the project appears safe. However, if this is just a fragment, further code should be reviewed for actual logic and potential vulnerabilities.",
