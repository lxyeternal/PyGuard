  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as either a comment or a docstring with no executable logic.\n- No data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The confidence levels are generally high (0.8 to 1), reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n- Malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all zero across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The **original code** is just a string: `\"\"\"Wilma CLI.\"\"\"` with no other code, imports, or logic.\n- The reports correctly identify that there is no executable code, no data handling, and no malicious activity.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:\n- No significant errors are present in the reports.\n- They are consistent and accurately describe the minimal nature of the code.\n- No overinterpretation or unwarranted suspicion is evident.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- The **malware scores** are all zero, which is appropriate given the absence of any suspicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are zero, consistent with the lack of code complexity or obfuscation.\n- The **security risk scores** are zero, aligning with the minimal, non-functional code snippet.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- Since there's no executable code, no data flow, and no suspicious behavior, all scores are reasonable.\n- The high confidence levels reflect certainty that the code is benign.\n\n### Potential Claims or Assumptions:\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly avoid assumptions.\n- The analysis is conservative and appropriate given the minimal code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk evident.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- If the code snippet is truly just a comment or docstring, these scores are correct.\n- If this is part of a larger codebase, further analysis of the actual implementation would be necessary, but based solely on this snippet, there is no concern.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The scores are appropriate, and there are no logical errors or unwarranted concerns. The minimal nature of the code strongly suggests it is a placeholder or documentation, with no security implications.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- No further action needed unless additional code is provided.",
