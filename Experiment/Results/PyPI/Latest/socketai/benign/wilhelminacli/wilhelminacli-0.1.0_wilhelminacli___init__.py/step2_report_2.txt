  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the underlying code snippet.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code snippet is simply a single comment or docstring: `\"Wilma CLI.\"`\n- No executable code, data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- All reports agree that the snippet is harmless and only descriptive.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the snippet is just a comment or docstring with no functional code.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **None.** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0 across all reports.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0 across all reports.\n- **Security risk score:** Correctly 0 across all reports.\n\n### Risk score justification:\n- Since there's no executable code, no data flow, and no suspicious constructs, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The reports' confidence levels vary but generally are high (0.8–1), which is reasonable given the minimal but accurate analysis.\n\n### Malware considerations:\n- **Malware score is 0** in all reports, which is justified. The snippet shows no malicious activity or indicators.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they only state that the snippet is a comment or docstring with no functional code.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores align with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the evidence, I concur with the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely a descriptive comment with no executable logic, data handling, or suspicious elements. It poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code snippet is harmless, and the scores reflect that. No further action or concern is warranted.",
