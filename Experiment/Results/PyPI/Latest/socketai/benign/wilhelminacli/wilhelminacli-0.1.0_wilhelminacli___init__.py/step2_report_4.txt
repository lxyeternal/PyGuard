  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and determine the appropriate scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall risk.\n\n1. **Presence of Code and Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the provided snippet is solely a comment or docstring: `\"Wilma CLI.\"` or similar. There are no functions, imports, variables, data flows, or executable logic.\n\n2. **Potential for Malicious Behavior**  \nGiven the extreme minimalism, there is no evidence of malicious activity. No code interacts with external systems, handles secrets, or performs any operation that could be malicious.\n\n3. **Obfuscation**  \nThe code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation techniques such as encoded strings, unusual syntax, or complex constructs.\n\n4. **Risk Assessment**  \nSince there's no executable code, data handling, or suspicious constructs, the security risk is negligible. The reports' conclusions align with this assessment.\n\n5. **Scores Justification**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is harmless, a risk score of 0 is justified. Some reports have slightly higher confidence, but given the absence of code, a risk score of 0 remains appropriate.\n\n6. **Potential Discrepancies**  \nSome reports have a confidence score slightly below 1 (e.g., 0.2 or 0.8). This reflects their certainty about the minimal content, which is reasonable.\n\n7. **Overall Summary**  \nThe reports are consistent with the actual code snippet. No signs of security issues, obfuscation, or malware are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the minimal nature of the code snippet. No further action or concern is warranted based on this content.",
