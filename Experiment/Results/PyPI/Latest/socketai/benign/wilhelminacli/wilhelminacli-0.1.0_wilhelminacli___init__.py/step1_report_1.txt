  "purpose": "This appears to be a comment or a docstring indicating the name or description of a command-line interface tool called 'Wilma CLI'.",
  "sources": "No data input sources, such as user input, environment variables, or external files, are explicitly present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there is no code that processes data or interacts with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows are identifiable since the code contains only a single comment or docstring with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, consisting solely of a docstring; no suspicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a single comment or docstring stating 'Wilma CLI.' with no executable statements, imports, or data handling. As such, it neither reads data nor interacts with external sources or sinks. There is no evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior. Its simplicity suggests it is either a placeholder or a part of a larger codebase not included here.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the given code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is harmless and provides minimal context—likely a comment or a module description.",
