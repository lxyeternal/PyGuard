  "purpose": "Terminal UI for Wilma email client with AI message summarization features.",
  "sources": "Message retrieval via 'client.get_messages()' and 'client.get_message_content()'; user interactions triggering API calls for summarization.",
  "sinks": "External API calls during message summarization; network communication with AI service.",
  "flows": "User selects message -> triggers 'summarize' action -> calls external summarization API -> updates UI with summary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured terminal application utilizing async API calls for message fetching and AI summarization. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. External API interactions are for legitimate features. No signs of sabotage or malicious code. The security risk score is low, reflecting external API dependency, but no evidence of mishandling or secret leakage is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent terminal UI for email management with AI summarization. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity detected. The low security risk score is justified given the external API use, which is standard for such features.",
