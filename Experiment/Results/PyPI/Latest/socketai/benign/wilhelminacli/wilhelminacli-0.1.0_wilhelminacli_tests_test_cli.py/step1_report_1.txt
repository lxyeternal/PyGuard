  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Wilma CLI application, testing login, message retrieval, and message display commands.",
  "sources": "Input data from command line arguments and mock objects; no untrusted external sources are read.",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout via the runner.invoke result; no direct data sinks related to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "User inputs (commands and options) lead to mocked function calls, which return predefined data, then displayed in output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. Usage of mocks is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of unit test functions using mocks to simulate CLI commands and responses. No external data input, no data exfiltration, network activity, or suspicious behavior detected. All operations appear to be for testing purposes, with no evidence of malicious payloads or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a CLI application. It uses mocking to simulate interactions and does not contain any malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks.",
