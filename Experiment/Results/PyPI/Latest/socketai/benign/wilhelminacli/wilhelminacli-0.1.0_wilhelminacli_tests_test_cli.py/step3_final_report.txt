{
  "purpose": "The code consists of unit tests for the Wilma CLI, testing login, message retrieval, and message display functionalities using mocks.",
  "sources": "Mocked functions and command-line arguments; no external untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout; no external system calls or network interactions with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke CLI commands, which call mocked internal functions, with data flow contained within the test environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward testing code employing mocks to simulate CLI interactions and data. No external data is processed, no network activity occurs, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The tests verify expected behaviors without interacting with real external systems or handling untrusted data. The code is well-structured, clear, and uses standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign test scaffolding with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The low risk and malware scores are appropriate, and the high confidence reflects the straightforward nature of the code.",
