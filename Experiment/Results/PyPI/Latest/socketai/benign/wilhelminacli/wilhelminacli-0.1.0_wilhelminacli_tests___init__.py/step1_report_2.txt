  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple module or script with a docstring indicating it is a 'Test package'.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks due to lack of operational code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with only a docstring; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains only a single docstring comment indicating 'Test package.' There are no functions, data inputs, outputs, or executable logic. Due to the minimal content, there are no sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies detected. The absence of executable code reduces the likelihood of malicious activity. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only a descriptive docstring with no operational logic or data handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
