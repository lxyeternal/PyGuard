{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple test package, likely used for basic testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "No data sources, inputs, or external data reads are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks, such as data outputs, network calls, or system modifications, are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as the code does not process or transfer any data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, containing only a comment string. No unusual or suspicious code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment indicating it is a 'Test package.' There are no functions, variables, imports, or other executable statements. This indicates it is likely a placeholder or minimal package with no malicious intent. The absence of any data handling, system calls, or network activity reduces concerns about malicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward and unremarkable, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves as a simple test package without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a non-functional placeholder with no apparent security concerns.",
