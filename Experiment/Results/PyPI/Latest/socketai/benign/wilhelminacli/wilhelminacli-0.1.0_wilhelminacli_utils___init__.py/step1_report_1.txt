  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for the Wilma CLI, specifically to import and return a MessageSummarizer class to avoid circular import issues.",
  "sources": "Import statement within the get_message_summarizer() function, which dynamically imports a class from wilhelminacli.utils.summarizer.",
  "sinks": "Return statement that provides the MessageSummarizer class to calling code.",
  "flows": "Calling get_message_summarizer() triggers import of MessageSummarizer, which is then returned for use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import within a function to avoid circular dependencies is standard practice; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function that delays import of a potentially circular dependency by importing the MessageSummarizer class within a function. This is a common pattern to avoid import errors in Python projects. The code does not perform any data processing, external network access, or execute untrusted code. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks. The only potential concern might be if the imported module or class is malicious, but based solely on this snippet, there is no indication of that.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function used to manage circular imports. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and adheres to common practices. No malicious intent or security threat is detected.",
