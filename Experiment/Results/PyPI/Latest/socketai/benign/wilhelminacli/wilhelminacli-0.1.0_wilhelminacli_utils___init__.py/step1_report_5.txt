  "purpose": "Utility functions for the Wilma CLI, specifically for importing a MessageSummarizer class to avoid circular dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statement within the get_message_summarizer() function, which loads wilhelminacli.utils.summarizer.MessageSummarizer upon function call.",
  "sinks": "The import dynamically loads a class, but does not execute or manipulate untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "The function imports MessageSummarizer only when called, with no data flow outside this context.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs a delayed import to prevent circular dependencies, which is a common pattern and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple utility function that performs a dynamic import to avoid circular dependencies. This pattern is standard in Python to resolve import issues. The function does not execute any untrusted code or handle sensitive data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility to delay import of a class to prevent circular dependencies. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
