{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for Wilma CLI, specifically providing a way to import the MessageSummarizer class while avoiding circular import issues.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only imports a class when the function is called.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data anywhere; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The only flow is when get_message_summarizer() is invoked, it dynamically imports and returns the MessageSummarizer class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The dynamic import is a standard Python pattern to avoid circular dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function that delays import of a class to prevent circular import issues in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or security risks. The code structure and logic are straightforward and standard for such use cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and serves a utility purpose for managing import dependencies. No malicious behavior, no security risks detected.",
