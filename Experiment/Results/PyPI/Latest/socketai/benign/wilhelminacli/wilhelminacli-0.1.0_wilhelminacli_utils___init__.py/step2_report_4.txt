  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Security Risks:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward utility function designed to avoid circular import issues by dynamically importing a class within a function.\n   - There are no signs of data exfiltration, external network activity, code obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n   - The import pattern is a common Python practice, and no suspicious behavior is observed.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code logic is sound and standard for handling circular dependencies.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the code snippet.\n   - The reports' assessments are consistent and accurate regarding the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Malware score: All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign analysis.\n   - Obfuscated score: All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Security risk: Scores are mostly 0, with one report noting 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, a score of 0.1 is slightly high but still low; the justification is that the code's purpose is structural, not malicious.\n   - Since no malicious activity is detected, and the code is standard, these scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent.\n   - They recognize the code as a common pattern and do not overstate potential risks.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency and Final Judgment:**\n   - The code is a standard utility function with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n   - The risk scores are appropriate and justified.\n   - No changes are necessary; the assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (acknowledging the structural nature but not indicating actual risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is benign, serving a structural purpose to manage circular dependencies. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the analysis. No further action or concern is warranted.",
