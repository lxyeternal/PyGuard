  "purpose": "Utility functions for Wilma CLI, specifically for importing and providing access to the MessageSummarizer class.",
  "sources": "Import statement for MessageSummarizer inside a function, which delays import until function call.",
  "sinks": "The import statement is a sink where the class is imported; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "Calling get_message_summarizer() triggers the import and returns the MessageSummarizer class.",
  "anomalies": "Use of delayed import to avoid circular dependencies is standard; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple utility function that delays importing a class to prevent circular import issues. It does not process or handle untrusted input, nor does it contain any malicious or suspicious code. The import is standard practice in Python for avoiding circular dependencies. No anomalies, hidden code, or obfuscated structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and serves a structural purpose in the larger project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
