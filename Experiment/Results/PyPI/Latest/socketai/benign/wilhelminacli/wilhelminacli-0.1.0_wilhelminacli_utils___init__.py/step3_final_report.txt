  "purpose": "To avoid circular import issues by dynamically importing the MessageSummarizer class within a function.",
  "sources": "The import statement within the get_message_summarizer() function, which reads the wilhelminacli.utils.summarizer module at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication; the code only performs a delayed import and returns a class reference.",
  "flows": "The function is called, executing the import statement, which loads the MessageSummarizer class from the module, then returns it.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses a common pattern for managing circular dependencies in Python projects.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility function that performs a delayed import to prevent circular dependencies. It does not process untrusted data, execute external code, or perform any network operations. The import pattern is standard in Python for such cases. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of this pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility pattern used to manage circular dependencies. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
