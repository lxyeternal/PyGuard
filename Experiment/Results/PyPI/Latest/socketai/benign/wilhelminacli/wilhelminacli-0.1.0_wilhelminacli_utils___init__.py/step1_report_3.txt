  "purpose": "Utility functions for Wilma CLI, specifically for importing and providing access to the MessageSummarizer class.",
  "sources": "Import statement within get_message_summarizer() function that dynamically imports MessageSummarizer from wilhelminacli.utils.summarizer.",
  "sinks": "The return of the MessageSummarizer class; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "The function imports the MessageSummarizer class when called and returns it; no data flow from untrusted sources is present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a delayed import to avoid circular dependencies is standard practice; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple utility function that performs a delayed import of a class to prevent circular dependencies. It imports the MessageSummarizer class only when the function is invoked, then returns it. No input handling, no external data reads, no code execution with untrusted data, and no obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. The import statement is within a function, which is a common pattern to avoid circular import issues. The code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function intended for delayed import to avoid circular dependencies. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
