  "purpose": "Configure pytest testing framework with custom marker and disable logging during tests.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines a fixture and a configuration function within the testing setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily sets configuration and logging state.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; standard pytest setup code with no obfuscation or hidden actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pytest configuration function to add a custom marker and a fixture that disables logging during tests. Both are standard testing practices. No external input is processed, no data is leaked, and no suspicious or malicious code is present. The code does not perform any network communication, data theft, or system modification. It is straightforward setup code for a testing environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is normal test setup code with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It simply configures pytest markers and disables logging during tests. No security risks detected.",
