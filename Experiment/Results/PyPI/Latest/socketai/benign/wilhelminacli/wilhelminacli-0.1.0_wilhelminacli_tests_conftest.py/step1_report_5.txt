  "purpose": "Configure pytest settings and disable logging during tests.",
  "sources": "The code reads from standard imports (logging, typing, pytest), and the 'config' parameter in pytest_configure.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code solely configures testing framework and logging behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines a pytest configuration function to add a marker, and a fixture that disables logging during test execution. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, or malicious code. The code performs straightforward setup tasks related to testing configuration without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard testing setup code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
