  "purpose": "Configure pytest testing environment by adding a marker for asyncio tests and disabling logging during test execution.",
  "sources": "Import statements for logging and pytest modules; pytest_configure function; disable_logging fixture reading no external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves setting a marker and temporarily disabling logging; no data from external sources is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest setup script that adds a custom marker for asyncio tests and disables logging during tests. It involves no external inputs, network activity, or data leaks. The code is simple, readable, and performs common configuration tasks. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, and confidence is high due to the code's clarity and simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest configuration script with no security concerns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
