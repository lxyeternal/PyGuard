  "purpose": "Configure pytest testing framework and disable logging during tests.",
  "sources": "Import statements, pytest_configure function, disable_logging fixture",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or insecure outputs present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code primarily configures testing environment without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines pytest configuration and fixture functions. The pytest_configure function adds a marker for asyncio tests. The disable_logging fixture disables logging during test runs and resets it afterward. There are no external data inputs, no untrusted data sources, and no dangerous code or backdoors present. The code is straightforward and adheres to normal testing setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest setup with no malicious behavior or security risks. It solely configures testing markers and disables logging during tests, which is safe and common practice.",
