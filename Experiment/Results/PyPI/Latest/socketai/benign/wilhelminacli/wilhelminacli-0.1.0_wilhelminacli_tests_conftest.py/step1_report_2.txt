  "purpose": "This code configures pytest testing framework settings and disables logging during tests.",
  "sources": "Imports from logging, pytest, and typing; the functions pytest_configure and disable_logging.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output functions that could leak data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely modifies configuration settings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard pytest and logging configuration with no suspicious code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pytest configuration function to add a marker for asyncio tests and a fixture that disables logging during tests. Both are standard testing setup procedures without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
