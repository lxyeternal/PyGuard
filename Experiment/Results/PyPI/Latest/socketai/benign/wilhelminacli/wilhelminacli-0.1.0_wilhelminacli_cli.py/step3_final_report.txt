{
  "purpose": "This code implements a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the Wilma school portal, allowing login, message retrieval, display, and AI-based summarization of messages.",
  "sources": "Credentials from environment variables or user prompts; network requests to Wilma portal via WilmaClient; external AI API for message summarization.",
  "sinks": "Network connections to Wilma server and external AI API; data flow from user input and API responses; display outputs to console.",
  "flows": "User inputs credentials -> credentials used for login -> messages retrieved from Wilma -> optional AI summarization -> output displayed on console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious external connections. Credential handling via prompts and environment variables is standard. External API usage is abstracted and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured CLI tool for Wilma with standard credential management, async network interactions, and external AI summarization. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External API keys are managed outside the code, and network activity aligns with expected behavior. Exception handling and logging are appropriate. The code does not exhibit signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, transparent, and secure. It performs its intended functions without signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2). The assessments are consistent and justified based on the code analysis.",
