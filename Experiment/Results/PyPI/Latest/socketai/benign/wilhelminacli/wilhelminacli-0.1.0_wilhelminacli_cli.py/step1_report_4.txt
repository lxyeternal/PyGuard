  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the Wilma school portal, including login, message retrieval, message display, and summarization using AI.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line options, environment variables, and prompts for username, password, and other parameters. Data is read from environment variables and user prompts.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows to console output (displaying messages and summaries) and potentially to AI summarization functions. Data also flows into network requests via WilmaClient for login and message retrieval.",
  "flows": "Input (user/env data) flows into login and message retrieval functions, which perform network requests via WilmaClient. Summarization functions process message data and output summaries. Data flows from user inputs and environment variables into network and AI functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No unusual code or obfuscation detected. No code that appears to perform malicious activities such as network exfiltration, system modification, or backdoors. The code relies on environment variables and prompts for credentials, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script uses environment variables and user prompts for credentials, then performs login and message retrieval through a WilmaClient instance, which manages network interactions. The use of asyncio for asynchronous operations is standard. AI summarization is wrapped in try-except blocks with proper exception logging. No suspicious network calls or data exfiltration activities are evident. The code only displays data via console and performs AI summarization, with no evident malicious intent. All network interactions are limited to the specified Wilma server, and there are no embedded or hidden commands or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a CLI for interacting with Wilma, with standard input/output handling and AI summarization features. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security threats are evident. The only potential concern is the handling of credentials, but it follows common best practices by prompting and environment variable use. Overall, this appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious application.",
