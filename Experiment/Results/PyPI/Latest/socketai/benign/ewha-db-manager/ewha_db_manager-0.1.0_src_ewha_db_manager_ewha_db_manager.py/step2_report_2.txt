  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently state that the code manages database connections, imports data, processes trajectory attributes, and groups data by CCTV ID.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are reported.\n- No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is evident.\n- The code uses standard libraries and practices.\n- The primary concern is the handling of database credentials, which are passed as parameters, not hardcoded.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; matches code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; data flows from database to DataFrames.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, straightforward data processing.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (low, given credential handling)  \n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. The low security risk reflects potential concern about passing credentials, but since they are not hardcoded, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on secure handling and standard practices.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2  \n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3:**\n\n- Similar findings; no hardcoded secrets, standard libraries, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (slightly lower, reflecting similar reasoning)  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4:**\n\n- Again, no suspicious activity, standard data processing, credentials passed as parameters.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2  \n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5:**\n\n- Slightly more detailed, mentions potential execution of SQL queries with string formatting, but the code uses f-strings with table names, which could be risky if table names are user-supplied. However, in typical usage, table names are controlled, and no dynamic execution or injection is evident.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (consistent with other reports)  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code or behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, no obfuscation observed.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), justified by the handling of credentials passed as parameters rather than hardcoded.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments needed; the assessments are fair and justified.\n- The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score could be slightly increased if considering the passing of sensitive credentials as parameters, but given the low risk and standard practice, 0.2 remains reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated Scores for Overall Risk:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk:** **0.2** (low, due to credential handling, but acceptable)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are justified based on the code review. No significant security issues or malicious behaviors are present.",
