{
  "purpose": "This script manages database connections, imports CCTV trajectory data, processes trajectory attributes, and groups data by CCTV ID for analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads database credentials (host, port, dbname, user, password) during initialization, executes SQL queries for schema inspection, counts, and data retrieval, and reads data from a PostgreSQL database.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could flow from database query results, especially if database credentials are compromised or the data source is malicious. Data flows into DataFrames, GeoDataFrames, and trajectory processing functions. No direct user input handling or network communication from untrusted sources is present.",
  "flows": "Database credentials (source) are used in connection establishment, which leads to data retrieval via SQL queries. Data is fetched into DataFrames, then enriched with trajectory attributes, and grouped by CCTV IDs. No external or untrusted data flows outside the database data source.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets; database credentials are passed as parameters, not embedded in code. The code uses standard libraries and methods for database access, data processing, and trajectory calculations. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The only minor anomaly is detailed logging but nothing malicious. No backdoors, code injections, or malicious network communications are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages database connections with proper opening and closing. It uses parameterized approach for SQL, avoiding injection. Data fetching uses server-side cursors, which is efficient. Trajectory attributes are added via established libraries. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activities. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. Overall, the code appears standard, well-structured, and free from malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a typical database data importer and processor with no evident malicious or sabotage behaviors. It handles sensitive information securely by passing credentials as parameters and does not exhibit any malware characteristics. Its functions are consistent with legitimate data processing tasks. No security risks or malicious indicators were found.",
