{
  "purpose": "The code manages database connections to a PostgreSQL server, imports data from specific tables, processes trajectory attributes, and groups data by CCTV ID for further analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads database credentials during class initialization, executes SQL queries to fetch table schemas and data, and reads data from specified tables.",
  "sinks": "Uses database credentials for connection; data is loaded into pandas and GeoDataFrames for processing. No direct untrusted data sink is evident beyond data import.",
  "flows": "Credentials flow from constructor to database connection; data flows from SQL queries through pandas DataFrames to trajectory attribute calculations; grouped data is produced for each CCTV ID.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code or unusual language features. Use of standard libraries and straightforward SQL queries. No network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script establishes a database connection with credentials provided at runtime, fetches table schema and data using server-side cursors for efficiency, and processes geographic trajectory data using movingpandas. Data is grouped by CCTV ID for further analysis. No signs of malicious code such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are evident. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is present. The code primarily performs data import, processing, and grouping operations with standard security practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard data management and processing module for trajectory data, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It handles sensitive information (database credentials) securely at runtime and does not contain any harmful code or external network connections.",
