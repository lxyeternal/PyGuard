{
  "purpose": "The script manages database connections and imports trajectory data from PostgreSQL tables, adding attributes and grouping data by CCTV ID for further analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads database credentials (host, port, dbname, user, password) during class initialization; executes SQL queries to fetch table info, row counts, and table data; reads from 'collect' schema; accesses 'snr_id', 'lon', 'lat', 'dtct_dt' columns; uses environment variables indirectly via input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data is loaded into pandas DataFrame and GeoDataFrame objects; trajectory attributes are added using movingpandas; no direct output or data exfiltration observed; database connection handles sensitive info but does not leak it.",
  "flows": "Credentials flow into database connection; SQL queries retrieve data; data flows from database into pandas/GeoDataFrames; trajectory attributes are computed; grouped by CCTV ID for further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables present; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms; exception handling is standard; code is well-structured and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles database connections with proper try-except blocks. Credentials are passed via constructor parameters, not hardcoded. SQL queries are standard SELECT statements; no injection risks since table names are parameterized and not user-inputted. Data import uses server-side cursors to prevent memory overload. Trajectory attribute calculation relies on established libraries without unsafe operations. No indicators of malicious intent or sabotage. The logging is standard and does not reveal sensitive info. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate data processing module with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data import and processing script for trajectory data from a PostgreSQL database. It manages credentials securely, performs standard SQL queries, processes data with common geospatial and trajectory libraries, and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security issues or malware indications are present.",
