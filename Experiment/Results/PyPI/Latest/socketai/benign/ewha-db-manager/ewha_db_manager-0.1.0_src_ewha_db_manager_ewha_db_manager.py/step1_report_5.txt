{
  "purpose": "The code manages database connections to import CCTV trajectory data, processes spatial and temporal attributes, and groups data by CCTV IDs for further analysis.",
  "sources": "Database connection parameters (host, port, dbname, user, password) in __init__, SQL queries for table schema and data import, user inputs for table name, data reading via psycopg2 and pandas, and environment variables for locale and system info.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of SQL queries with string formatting, use of database connection and cursor, creation of pandas DataFrames and GeoDataFrames, and processing of spatial and temporal data for analysis.",
  "flows": "User provides database credentials and table name → SQL queries are executed for schema and data retrieval → Data is converted into DataFrame and GeoDataFrame → Trajectory attributes are added → Data is grouped by CCTV ID for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; all database credentials are passed as parameters. SQL queries are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. Use of standard libraries and explicit query strings poses no obvious malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages database connections, fetches data using server-side cursors, and processes spatial data with standard libraries. No signs of backdoors, hidden code, or malicious network activity are present. The data import and processing routines are typical for spatial data analysis. Logging provides operational visibility. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious functions are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured database and spatial data processing module with no malicious behavior or security threats. It adheres to typical data engineering practices without suspicious or harmful code components.",
