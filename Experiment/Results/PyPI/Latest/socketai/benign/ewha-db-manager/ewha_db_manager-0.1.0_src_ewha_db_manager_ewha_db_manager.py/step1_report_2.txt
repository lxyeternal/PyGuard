{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to connect to a PostgreSQL database, import trajectory data from specified tables, process spatial and temporal attributes, and group data by CCTV IDs for further analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads database connection parameters (host, port, dbname, user, password), SQL queries for schema inspection, and table data via database cursors.",
  "sinks": "Data is converted into pandas DataFrames and GeoDataFrames; no explicit sinks are present, but data is processed internally and returned as Python objects.",
  "flows": "Source: database connection parameters and SQL queries -> Data fetched via database cursors -> DataFrame created and processed -> Geospatial attributes added -> Data grouped by CCTV IDs and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials are present; the database connection parameters are passed as function arguments. The code performs standard database access and data processing without unusual or obfuscated behavior. No suspicious external network connections, code obfuscation, or hidden backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages database connections, with proper try-except blocks and connection closing methods. Data import uses server-side cursors for efficiency. The data processing steps involve spatial and temporal feature calculations using well-established libraries. No suspicious code or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, external network communication beyond the database, or hidden code, is present. The logic and flow appear straightforward and consistent with typical data processing tasks. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or credential leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data import and processing script for trajectory analysis, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate component for spatial data analysis within a trusted environment.",
