  "purpose": "This code defines an import of the DBManager class from a local module and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.ewha_db_manager import DBManager)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data paths are evident in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The use of relative import suggests modular design but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a local module and specifies it for export. There are no data inputs, no sinks, no flows, and no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a straightforward module definition with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a basic import and export setup typical for Python modules.",
