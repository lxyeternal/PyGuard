{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class named DBManager from a local module ewha_db_manager and defines the module's public interface to include only DBManager.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module ewha_db_manager during import.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The import statement pulls code from ewha_db_manager into the current module; no data flow from untrusted sources occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs a local import and defines __all__, which is standard practice for module exports. No suspicious behavior, external data handling, or malicious activity is present. There are no embedded or hidden malicious patterns, and the structure is simple and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a straightforward module re-export. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
