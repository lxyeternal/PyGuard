  "purpose": "Implement various Monte Carlo and analytical methods for pricing financial options using GPU acceleration with CuPy and cuQuantum libraries.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as S0, K, H, r, T, sigma, and optional barrier_type; random number generation for simulations.",
  "sinks": "No clear data sinks or outputs that could leak data or perform harmful actions. No network, file I/O, or system command calls present.",
  "flows": "Random number generation (source) feeds into Monte Carlo simulations (sink), which produce option prices. No external data flow or untrusted input handling beyond parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of GPU-based random number generation for Monte Carlo simulations is standard for performance. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures. The code appears straightforward in implementing option pricing models.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions for pricing options via Monte Carlo simulations and closed-form calculations, leveraging CuPy for GPU acceleration. No signs of obfuscated code, hidden behavior, or malicious logic. All methods serve a clear financial modeling purpose. There are no network connections, file manipulations, or system commands that could indicate malicious intent. Random number generation is used appropriately for stochastic simulation, with no evidence of data exfiltration or backdoors. The code is well-structured and aligns with typical financial computation practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of financial option pricing models using GPU acceleration. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. The code is focused on performing computational finance tasks without any suspicious or harmful features.",
