{
  "purpose": "This code implements a BondPricing class for calculating zero-coupon and coupon bond prices, as well as duration, using numpy and cupy for numerical computations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as face_value, coupon_rate, r (interest rate), T (time), and freq are read when methods are invoked. No external or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to files, send data over networks, or interact with external systems. No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters into calculations within the class methods. Computed values are returned directly, with no external data handling or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. Usage of numpy and cupy is standard for numerical computations; cupy is imported but not used, which is not suspicious but possibly unnecessary.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward financial calculations without any external data sources or sinks. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The import of cupy is unused, which is benign but suggests possible leftover code or incomplete implementation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of bond valuation functions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The presence of unused cupy import is noted but not suspicious. Overall, this code does not pose a security threat.",
