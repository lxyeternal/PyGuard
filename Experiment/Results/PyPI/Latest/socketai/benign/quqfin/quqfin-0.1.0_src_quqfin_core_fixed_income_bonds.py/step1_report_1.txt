{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for bond pricing calculations, including zero-coupon and coupon bonds, as well as duration calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters for bond characteristics and interest rates (face_value, coupon_rate, r, T, freq). No external input sources like user input or network calls.",
  "sinks": "Performs calculations internally; no data output, network communication, or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs (parameters) used directly in mathematical computations for bond pricing and duration; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Uses numpy for calculations, but also imports cupy without utilizing it, which may indicate unnecessary code or potential obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. No malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward financial calculations using numpy. The import of cupy is unused, which could be redundant or a sign of incomplete code or obfuscation. All operations are standard mathematical formulas for bond valuation. No network calls, file operations, or suspicious code patterns are present. The presence of an unused library import warrants a note, but it does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of bond pricing formulas with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code. The unused import of cupy is suspicious but not malicious, possibly leftover or placeholder code. Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious.",
