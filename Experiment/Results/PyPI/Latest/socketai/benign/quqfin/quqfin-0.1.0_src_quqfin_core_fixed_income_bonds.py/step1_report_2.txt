{
  "purpose": "The code provides methods for pricing bonds and calculating duration using financial mathematics calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as face value, coupon rate, interest rate (r), time to maturity (T), and frequency (freq).",
  "sinks": "Performs mathematical calculations with no external output or data leakage. Uses numpy and cupy libraries but does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in mathematical formulas for pricing; no external data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "Uses both numpy and cupy libraries but does not utilize GPU acceleration or any advanced features of cupy. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code features are present. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements basic financial functions for bond pricing and duration. It imports numpy and cupy but only uses numpy for calculations, which appears standard. There are no inputs read from untrusted sources, nor are there outputs to external systems. No suspicious behavior, hidden code, or malicious intent evident. The inclusion of cupy seems unnecessary but not malicious. No code injection, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of financial calculations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of cupy without usage might be redundant but does not impact security. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
