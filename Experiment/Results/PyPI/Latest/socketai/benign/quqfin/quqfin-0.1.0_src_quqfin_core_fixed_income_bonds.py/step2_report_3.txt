  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward implementation of bond pricing formulas.\n- The only notable anomaly is the import of `cupy`, which is unused in all cases.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or malicious code patterns are identified.\n- The scores assigned for malware (0) and obfuscation (0) are consistent across reports.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1), which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and discrepancies:\n\n**Code correctness:**\n\n- The code correctly implements zero-coupon and coupon bond pricing, as well as duration calculations, using standard formulas.\n- No issues are observed in the mathematical logic.\n\n**Unused import of `cupy`:**\n\n- All reports note that `cupy` is imported but not used.\n- This is suspicious but not malicious—likely leftover or placeholder code.\n\n**Malicious behavior:**\n\n- No evidence of backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- No network or file operations.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. All reports agree there is no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1. This is reasonable, considering the unused import might be a minor oversight or potential for future malicious code, but currently, it poses no risk.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or points of contention:\n\n- The presence of `cupy` import, unused, could be considered a minor security concern if it hints at incomplete or malicious code insertion. However, all reports correctly interpret it as benign or suspicious but not malicious.\n- The scores for malware and obfuscation seem appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minor concern due to unused import, but overall low risk)\n- **Malware score justification:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or exploits.\n- **Obfuscated score justification:** Code is straightforward, no obfuscation techniques used.\n- **Obfuscation score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1, reflecting the unnecessary import but no actual security threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                                                                     |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious activity or code present.                                                          |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation techniques.                                    |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1               | Minor concern due to unused import of `cupy`; no actual security vulnerability.               |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with a minor note on the unused library import.**",
