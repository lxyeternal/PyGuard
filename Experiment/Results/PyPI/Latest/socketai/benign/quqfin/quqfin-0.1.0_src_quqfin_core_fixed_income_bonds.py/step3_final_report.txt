  "purpose": "Implementation of bond pricing and duration calculations using numpy, with an unused cupy import.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code reads input parameters for calculations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into calculation methods; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'cupy', which is not utilized in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard bond valuation formulas with straightforward logic. The 'cupy' import is unused, indicating possible leftover code but not malicious. No external data handling, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. The formulas are correct, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The only minor concern is the unnecessary import, which does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of bond pricing functions with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The only issue is the unused 'cupy' import, which is benign. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is safe for use.",
