{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for bond pricing calculations, including zero-coupon, coupon bond prices, and duration calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as face_value, coupon_rate, r (interest rate), T (time to maturity), and frequency. No external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Performs mathematical calculations and returns bond pricing metrics; no data leaks, network communication, or sensitive data handling detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in mathematical formulas to produce output values; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of both numpy and cupy libraries without clear reason; no malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for financial computations with standard formulas. It uses numpy for computations but imports cupy without subsequent use, which is unusual but not malicious. There are no external data sources, network calls, or credential handling. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present. The structure and logic are straightforward and typical for financial modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard bond pricing utility with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The import of cupy is unnecessary but benign. Overall, it is a legitimate financial calculation script.",
