  "purpose": "Calculate financial risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional VaR, and Sharpe Ratio using GPU-accelerated arrays.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'returns' in __init__ method, which is passed externally when instantiating the class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks or security-sensitive actions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'returns' input to various computations: percentile, mean, and standard deviation calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'RiskMetrics' that initializes with returns data, converting it into a GPU array using CuPy. It provides methods to calculate VaR, Conditional VaR, and Sharpe Ratio. The use of CuPy indicates GPU acceleration for potentially large datasets. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code performs straightforward financial computations with standard methods. The reliance on external 'returns' data is normal for such calculations. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of financial risk metrics calculation using GPU acceleration. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It appears to be legitimate and focused solely on numerical analysis.",
