  "purpose": "Compute financial risk metrics (VaR, Conditional VaR, Sharpe Ratio) using GPU-accelerated arrays.",
  "sources": "Input returns data provided during class instantiation, stored as a cupy array.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or data leaks; calculations are internal and self-contained.",
  "flows": "Input returns -> stored as cp.array -> used in percentile, mean, std calculations -> results output.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward implementation with standard statistical functions; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes with return data, converts it to a GPU array, and computes risk metrics using standard functions. It does not perform any network communication, file I/O, or system modifications. The use of cupy is legitimate for GPU acceleration. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 or 0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment. No evidence suggests vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The code is a standard implementation of risk metrics, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of financial risk metrics using GPU acceleration. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the high confidence scores are justified. The slight elevation of the risk score to 0.1 in some reports can be lowered to 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.",
