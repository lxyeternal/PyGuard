{
  "purpose": "This code calculates risk metrics such as Value at Risk, Conditional Value at Risk, and Sharpe Ratio for a given set of return data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'returns' parameter provided during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any external data sinks, network communications, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the 'returns' parameter into a cp.array, then through statistical functions to compute risk metrics; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; uses standard numpy and cupy functions for numerical computations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and cupy, initializing an object with return data converted to a GPU array via cupy. It computes percentile-based Value at Risk, Conditional Value at Risk, and Sharpe Ratio, all using standard library functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated code. The use of cupy suggests GPU acceleration but does not indicate malicious intent. No external data transmission or system modification is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of financial risk metrics calculation, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
