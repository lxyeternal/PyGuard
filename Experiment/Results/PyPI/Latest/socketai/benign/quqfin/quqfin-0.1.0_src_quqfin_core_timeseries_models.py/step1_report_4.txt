  "purpose": "Implementations of time series models including Kalman filter and GARCH for statistical analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, self.data initialization.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data output or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through mathematical calculations within methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Use of third-party libraries (numpy, statsmodels, cupy) is standard for numerical analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for time series analysis with methods for Kalman filtering and GARCH modeling. The Kalman filter implementation uses numpy arrays and performs standard predict-update steps without external data transmission or security-sensitive operations. The GARCH implementation calculates volatility estimates based on historical returns, following typical models without unsafe or malicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or backdoors are present. No dynamic code execution or suspicious code flow detected. Use of third-party libraries appears appropriate and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of statistical time series models with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It functions solely for analysis purposes and does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious activity.",
