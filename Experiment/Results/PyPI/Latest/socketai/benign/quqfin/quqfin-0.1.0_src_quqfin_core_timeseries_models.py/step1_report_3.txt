{
  "purpose": "The code provides implementations of a Kalman filter for state estimation and a GARCH model for volatility estimation in time series data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the constructor parameter 'data' and method parameters 'observations' and 'returns'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is directly sent to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal calculations within 'kalman_filter' and 'garch' methods, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic code execution. The code appears straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard statistical models without malicious constructs. The 'kalman_filter' method performs state estimation using well-understood formulas. The 'garch' method estimates volatility with common parameters. No hidden code, dynamic execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Usage of numpy and statsmodels is standard for scientific computations. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of time series models for analysis purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
