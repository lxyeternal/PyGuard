  "purpose": "Implementing a basic order book data structure for managing bids and asks in a trading system.",
  "sources": "Data is read from method inputs: add_bid and add_ask (price, volume).",
  "targets": "Method get_spread accesses internal data to compute the spread; no untrusted data is directly used here.",
  "flows": "add_bid/add_ask (sources) modify bids/asks; get_spread reads bids/asks to compute spread.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, and no external network activity. Uses standard libraries only.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an OrderBook class with methods to add bids and asks, retrieve the best bid and ask prices, and compute the spread. It uses defaultdict for storing prices and volumes, with no input/output beyond method parameters. There are no external data sources, no data leaks, no suspicious logic, or hidden behaviors. The logic is straightforward and typical for such a data structure. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation of an order book data structure with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
