{
  "purpose": "This code implements a basic order book for trading, managing bids and asks with functions to add, retrieve best prices, and calculate the spread.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (price, volume) for add_bid and add_ask; internal data structures (defaultdict) for storing bid and ask prices and volumes.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network communication; data remains within internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into internal dictionaries; get_best_bid and get_best_ask retrieve maximum and minimum keys; get_spread computes difference between best ask and bid.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured implementation of an order book using Python dictionaries. It performs expected operations without external dependencies or malicious logic. No signs of obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The logic is clear, and the code aligns with typical order book components. All signals indicate benign, standard functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard order book implementation with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
