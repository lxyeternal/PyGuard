  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Nature:**\n   - The code is a simple module with a docstring comment and a version variable assignment.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or external interactions.\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as metadata for the library.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - No secrets, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or data flows.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Report:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, minimal, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - The malware scores are correctly set to 0, as there's no malware.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n   - The risk scores are 0, reflecting no security concerns.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations:**\n   - No issues found; all reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No need to adjust scores or challenge assumptions, as the code is straightforward.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code snippet is harmless, containing only metadata.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No further action needed; the code is safe.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the existing reports and the actual code content.",
