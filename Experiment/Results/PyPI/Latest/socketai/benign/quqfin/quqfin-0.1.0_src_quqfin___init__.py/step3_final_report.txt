  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for the library, defining version information.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only static assignment of __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code logic, input/output, or external interactions; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module with a docstring and a version string assignment. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external data handling. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The code's simplicity and transparency indicate it is metadata only, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as metadata for the package. All security signals are absent, and the code poses no threat or risk.",
