{
  "purpose": "Implement a portfolio optimization class with methods for risk parity, Black-Litterman, and Markowitz portfolio optimization strategies.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy, cupy, scipy.optimize; reads input data such as returns, covariance matrix, market caps, views, and view confidences; reads target return and constraints.",
  "sinks": "Calls scipy.optimize.minimize which executes optimization with user-defined functions; performs matrix calculations for portfolio weights.",
  "flows": "Input data (returns, covariance, views, confidences) flows into class initialization and method parameters; optimization functions process data and generate results; data flows through the optimization pipeline.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads; use of standard mathematical and optimization libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code implements common portfolio optimization algorithms—risk parity, Black-Litterman, and Markowitz—using standard libraries. It reads data via parameters, performs calculations, and calls scipy.optimize.minimize with user-defined objective functions and constraints. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network communication, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code appears to be a typical financial optimization module with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of portfolio optimization algorithms with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain hidden backdoors, data leaks, or harmful operations. The usage of optimization routines and mathematical functions is typical for its domain.",
