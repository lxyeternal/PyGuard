  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of portfolio optimization algorithms with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of GPU acceleration via cupy is an optimization choice, not a threat. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, with minor variations in security risk scoring that can be justified as conservative. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy."
