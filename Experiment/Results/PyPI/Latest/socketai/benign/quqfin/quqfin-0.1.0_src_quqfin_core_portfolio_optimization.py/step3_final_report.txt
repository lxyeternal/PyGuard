{
  "purpose": "Implements portfolio optimization algorithms including risk parity, Black-Litterman, and Markowitz methods, processing input data for financial modeling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments such as returns, covariance matrices, market caps, views, and view confidences.",
  "sinks": "No external data or network communication; internal calculations and optimization routines only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables through mathematical functions and optimization constraints to produce optimized portfolio weights.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of both numpy and cupy is unconventional but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard financial calculations for portfolio optimization using well-known libraries. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of cupy for GPU acceleration is unusual but not malicious. No external communication or data exfiltration is present. The logic aligns with legitimate financial modeling practices. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of portfolio optimization algorithms with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of GPU acceleration via cupy is an optimization choice, not a threat. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, with minor variations in security risk scoring that can be justified as conservative. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy.",
