{
  "purpose": "The code implements a portfolio optimization tool with risk parity, mean-variance (Markowitz), and Black-Litterman models.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters: returns, covariance matrix, market caps, views, and view confidences.",
  "sinks": "Uses scipy.optimize.minimize to perform optimization; no direct data leaks or network calls detected.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into mathematical models; optimization results are returned as arrays of portfolio weights.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Uses standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, cupy).",
  "analysis": "The code performs mathematical financial modeling for portfolio optimization using standard approaches. It employs numpy and cupy for numerical computations and scipy for optimization. No signs of obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or malicious injections. All data flows appear to be within the scope of normal numerical analysis. No unusual or suspicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of portfolio optimization algorithms without malicious intent. It relies on common scientific libraries and performs standard computations. No indicators of malware or malicious behavior are present.",
