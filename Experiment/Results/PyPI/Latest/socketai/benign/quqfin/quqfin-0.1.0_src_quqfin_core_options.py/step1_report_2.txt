{
  "purpose": "Define a class for quantum-based European call option pricing using cuQuantum's CircuitToStateVector.",
  "sources": "Imports cuquantum.CircuitToStateVector; no other data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not write data to external sources or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows to external systems or network; the flow is limited to internal class usage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears straightforward and uses standard library imports without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a quantum circuit class from cuquantum and defines a class for option pricing. It contains a constructor initializing a quantum circuit object. The method 'european_call_price' is a placeholder with no implementation, only documentation. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Usage of cuquantum library is standard for quantum computing tasks. No hardcoded credentials, environment variable misuse, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, straightforward, and intended for quantum financial modeling. No malicious or security-threatening elements detected.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
