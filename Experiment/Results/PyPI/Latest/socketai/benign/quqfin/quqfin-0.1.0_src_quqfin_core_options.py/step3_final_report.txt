  "purpose": "Framework for quantum option pricing using amplitude estimation with cuquantum library",
  "sources": "Import of cuquantum.CircuitToStateVector and numpy; class initialization",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmission; placeholder method with no execution",
  "flows": "No active data flow; method is unimplemented (pass), so no source-to-sink flow exists",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors; only a class structure with a placeholder method",
  "analysis": "The code imports a legitimate quantum computing library and defines a class for quantum finance modeling. The method intended for implementation is empty, indicating incomplete code but no malicious or security-related issues. No external data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, readable, and uses standard libraries. Given the absence of malicious logic, obfuscation, or security flaws, the overall security risk is minimal. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate, with a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to incomplete implementation but no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, incomplete framework for quantum option pricing with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It uses standard libraries and contains no external data leaks or suspicious behaviors. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero, consistent with the analysis.",
