{
  "purpose": "Implement Black-Scholes option pricing model with Greeks calculations for financial analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters: S, K, r, sigma, T (all passed as function arguments). No external data sources or untrusted input streams are used.",
  "sinks": "Returns computed option prices and Greeks; no data leakage or untrusted data output. No system or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into static methods, which perform calculations; no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with static methods to compute various financial metrics using standard mathematical formulas. It employs numpy and scipy.stats for mathematical functions. There are no external data fetches, system commands, or network operations. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of well-known financial formulas. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The use of third-party libraries is appropriate and safe. Overall, the code functions solely for financial calculations with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of the Black-Scholes model and Greeks calculations for options pricing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is a standard financial modeling snippet with no suspicious features.",
