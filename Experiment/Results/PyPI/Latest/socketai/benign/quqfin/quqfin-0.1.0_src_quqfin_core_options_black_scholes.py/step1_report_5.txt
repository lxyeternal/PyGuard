{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to calculate Black-Scholes option prices and Greeks, primarily for financial modeling and derivatives pricing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for option pricing (S, K, r, sigma, T) within static methods; no external or untrusted data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that handle untrusted data; calculations are purely mathematical and internal.",
  "flows": "Inputs are processed through mathematical formulas to produce outputs like option prices and Greeks; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, cupy) for calculations. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-known formulas for Black-Scholes options pricing and Greeks. It uses standard libraries for mathematical functions and statistical distributions. The inclusion of 'cupy' is notable but not inherently malicious; it can be used for GPU acceleration. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and consistent with typical financial computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Black-Scholes option pricing with Greeks, without any malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. The presence of 'cupy' may be for performance optimization but does not suggest malicious activity.",
