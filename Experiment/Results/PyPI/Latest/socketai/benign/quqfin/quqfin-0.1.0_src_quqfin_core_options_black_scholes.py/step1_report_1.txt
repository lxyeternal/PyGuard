{
  "purpose": "This code implements the Black-Scholes model for option pricing and related Greeks calculations, likely intended for financial analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy, scipy.stats.norm, and cupy; class methods that compute option prices and Greeks based on input parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (S, K, r, sigma, T) flow into calculations of d1, d2, and various Greeks; no external data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of cupy is noted but not utilized in any computations; code appears straightforward and conventional for financial calculations with no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static methods for calculations related to the Black-Scholes formula, including option prices and Greeks. It imports numpy for numerical operations and scipy.stats.norm for distribution functions. The inclusion of cupy, a GPU-accelerated library, is not utilized, which could suggest unnecessary dependencies but not malicious intent. The code performs standard mathematical formulas without any dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious data handling. There are no network calls, data leaks, or credential handling. All functions serve a clear purpose related to option pricing calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of the Black-Scholes option pricing model and Greeks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are present. The use of cupy is unnecessary but not malicious. Overall, the code seems safe and legitimate for its intended financial modeling purpose.",
