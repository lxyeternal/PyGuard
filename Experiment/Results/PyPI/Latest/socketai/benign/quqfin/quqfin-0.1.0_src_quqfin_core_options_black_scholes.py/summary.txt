  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of the Black-Scholes model with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The only minor issue is the unused 'cupy' import, which could be removed for clarity but does not introduce security risks. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in financial modeling."
