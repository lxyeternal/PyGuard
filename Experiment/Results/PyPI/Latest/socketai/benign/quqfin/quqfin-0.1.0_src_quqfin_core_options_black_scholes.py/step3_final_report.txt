  "purpose": "Implementation of Black-Scholes option pricing model and Greeks calculations for financial derivatives.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as S, K, r, sigma, T for calculations; no external data sources or user input within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file output; purely computational functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical functions computing d1, d2, and Greeks; no external data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'cupy' library; no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of the Black-Scholes model using numpy and scipy.stats.norm. The 'cupy' library is imported but not utilized, which is an inefficiency but not malicious. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions are deterministic and mathematically correct. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's content, with the minor concern being the unnecessary dependency, which does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of the Black-Scholes model with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The only minor issue is the unused 'cupy' import, which could be removed for clarity but does not introduce security risks. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in financial modeling.",
