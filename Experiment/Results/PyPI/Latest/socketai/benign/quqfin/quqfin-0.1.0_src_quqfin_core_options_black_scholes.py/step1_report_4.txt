  "purpose": "Implementations of the Black-Scholes model for option pricing and Greeks calculations in financial analysis.",
  "sources": "Import of numpy, scipy.stats.norm, and cupy; function parameters; static method calculations.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code performs mathematical calculations without external data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; purely mathematical computation based on function parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of cupy imported but not utilized; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a mathematical model for option pricing. It uses standard libraries (numpy, scipy) for calculations. Although cupy is imported, it is not used anywhere in the code, which may indicate unused dependencies but not malicious intent. No input/output operations, network activity, or data leaks are present. The functions are well-structured with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of the Black-Scholes model with no malicious intent or security risks. The unused cupy import could be optimized, but it does not introduce security concerns.",
