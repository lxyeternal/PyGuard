  "purpose": "Implementation of Black-Scholes model for pricing European options and calculating Greeks.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters for financial calculations: S, K, r, sigma, T.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical functions to compute option prices and Greeks; no untrusted data flow to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code performs standard mathematical operations for financial modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports well-known scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, cupy) for numerical and statistical computations. It defines static methods for calculations consistent with financial mathematics, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No external network calls, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. Usage of 'cupy' is for GPU acceleration but does not in itself indicate malicious intent; it's a normal optimization in numerical computing. The code appears standard and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of the Black-Scholes option pricing model and Greeks calculation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The presence of 'cupy' suggests performance optimization but does not introduce security risks.",
