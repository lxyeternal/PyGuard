{
  "purpose": "The code implements multiple trading strategy algorithms for analyzing stock prices, including moving average crossover, momentum, and mean reversion strategies.",
  "sources": "Input is taken from the 'prices' parameter during class initialization; data is read from the 'prices' list/array provided to the constructor.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that send data over networks, write to files, or execute external commands. No untrusted data output or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "Input prices flow into various calculations for moving averages, momentum, and z-scores; these calculations produce signals indicating buy/sell decisions. No external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The code performs standard financial calculations using numpy and pandas libraries, which are common for such tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods that perform typical technical analysis calculations using numpy and pandas. It utilizes rolling window functions for moving averages and standard deviations, as well as logarithmic returns for momentum. All operations are mathematical and standard for trading algorithms. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data handling are present. The code relies on well-known libraries and standard mathematical operations, with no external communication or secret data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a straightforward implementation of trading strategies with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard calculations without any suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. It is safe from a security perspective.",
