{
  "purpose": "The code implements trading strategies based on moving averages, momentum, and mean reversion to generate trading signals from price data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'prices' parameter provided during class instantiation, which is stored as a NumPy array.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any external data sinks or output mechanisms; it solely processes data internally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'self.prices' through calculations of moving averages, momentum, and z-scores to generate signals (buy, sell, hold).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries (numpy, pandas) appropriately. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with three methods for generating trading signals using common technical analysis techniques. The implementation appears straightforward, using standard library functions. No data leaks, network communication, or hidden operations are present. The logic follows typical financial analysis patterns without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of trading strategies without any malicious intent or suspicious activity. It performs data analysis to produce trading signals solely based on the input prices.",
