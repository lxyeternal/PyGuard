{
  "purpose": "This code implements several trading strategy algorithms based on price data, including moving average crossover, momentum, and mean reversion strategies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'prices' parameter during class instantiation. It uses numpy and pandas libraries for calculations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks like network communication, file writing, or environment variable access are present. The code solely performs in-memory calculations.",
  "flows": "Input data 'prices' flows through various calculations to generate trading signals (buy, sell, hold). There are no external data transmissions or sensitive data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code uses standard numerical methods for trading signals.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'TradingStrategies' with methods to generate trading signals based on common financial algorithms. It uses numpy and pandas for data processing. All computations are purely mathematical and in-memory. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, typical for financial modeling, and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of trading algorithms with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe to use from a cybersecurity perspective.",
