{
  "purpose": "Implementing basic trading strategies such as moving average crossover, momentum, and mean reversion based on historical price data.",
  "sources": "Prices input array provided during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; calculations are performed on internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input prices array through statistical computations and indicator signals.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Usage of standard libraries for mathematical and statistical computations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods for common trading strategies, utilizing numpy and pandas for data processing. The strategies perform standard calculations such as moving averages, momentum, and z-scores. There are no signs of malicious code such as network access, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The use of data processing libraries is typical for quantitative analysis. No suspicious input/output handling or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of trading strategies without malicious intent. It uses standard libraries and techniques for financial data analysis. No security threats or malware signals identified.",
