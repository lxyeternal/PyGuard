{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for implementing multiple trading strategies based on historical price data, including moving average crossover, momentum, and mean reversion strategies.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'prices' parameter during class instantiation; uses 'np.array' and 'pd.Series' for data manipulation; no external or untrusted data inputs are explicitly read within methods.",
  "sinks": "Computations are internal; no data is sent externally, stored insecurely, or used in insecure ways; no network connections, file writes, or external data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'prices' is processed internally through rolling calculations and differences; signals are generated internally based on computations; no external output or untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors; code performs standard statistical computations without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard trading algorithms using well-known pandas and numpy operations. It processes input price data to generate trading signals based on moving averages, momentum, and mean reversion metrics. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code is straightforward, with clear logic and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. It does not involve external data sources or sinks that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of trading strategies without any malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs internal calculations for trading signals based on provided historical data. No indicators of malware or malicious activity are present.",
