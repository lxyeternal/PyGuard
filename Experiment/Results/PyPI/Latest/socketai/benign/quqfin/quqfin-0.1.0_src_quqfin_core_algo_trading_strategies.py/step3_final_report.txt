  "purpose": "Implementation of trading strategies including moving average crossover, momentum, and mean reversion calculations using numpy and pandas.",
  "sources": "Input price data provided during class instantiation, processed internally via numpy and pandas series.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Input prices flow into calculations for moving averages, momentum, and z-scores; signals generated internally without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard financial analysis calculations with straightforward use of numpy and pandas. No external data or network activity is involved. The logic is transparent, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The signals are generated based on well-known strategies, and no suspicious data flows or anomalies are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk between 0.1 and 0.2) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, transparent implementation of common trading strategies with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current security risk scores slightly overstate the minimal risk; they can be confidently lowered to 0.1, reflecting negligible threat. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0.",
