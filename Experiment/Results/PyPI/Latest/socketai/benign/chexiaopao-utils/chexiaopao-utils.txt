      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard webhook message sender with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The only potential concern is the use of user-controlled webhook URLs, which is typical for such integrations but should be used cautiously. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low security risk score around 0.1 to 0.2."

      "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for SQL statement generation, free of malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the lack of parameterized queries, which exposes potential for SQL injection if inputs are untrusted. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly assigned as 0. The risk score should be around 0.6, reflecting moderate security risk due to injection vulnerabilities. To improve security, refactoring to use parameterized queries is recommended. The current code is benign but requires caution in usage."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. The minimal security risk stems from external trust in the webhook URL, not the code itself. Overall, the code is safe for use with standard precautions regarding webhook URL security."
