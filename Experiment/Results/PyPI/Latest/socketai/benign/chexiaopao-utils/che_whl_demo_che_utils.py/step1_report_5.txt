  "purpose": "A simple function to print a string with a prefix",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' passed to pppprint function",
  "sinks": "The print statement that outputs combined string",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows from function parameter to the print statement",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that concatenates a static string 'che' with its input parameter and prints the result. The function itself performs a straightforward operation without any external data sources or sinks that could lead to security issues. There is no indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be benign, serving a simple output purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic print function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely outputs a string with a prefix and does not involve any complex or suspicious operations.",
