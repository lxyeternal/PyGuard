  "purpose": "A simple utility function that concatenates a static prefix 'che' with input text and prints it.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' passed to the function pppprint.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs concatenated string to standard output; no untrusted data flow beyond this.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows directly into the print statement after concatenation with 'che'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that prepends 'che' to any input string and prints it. It is simple, with no external data sources, network activity, or complex logic. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscation score 0, and very low security risk scores (~0 to 0.1). The confidence in benign assessment is high. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present. The minimal risk score (0.1) in one report is acceptable but can be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is harmless and does not pose security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscation concerns. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, aligning with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
