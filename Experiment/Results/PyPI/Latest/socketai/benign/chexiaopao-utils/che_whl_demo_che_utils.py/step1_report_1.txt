  "purpose": "A simple function to print a string with a prefix",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' to the function 'pppprint'",
  "sinks": "The print statement which outputs concatenated string to stdout",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows into the print statement, concatenated with 'che' and outputted",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; the function is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that prepends 'che' to any provided input and prints it. There are no external data sources, no use of environment variables, no network activity, or other suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and appears benign. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The function's purpose seems to be a simple print utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward function for printing a modified string. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected.",
