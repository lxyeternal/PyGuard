  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The analysis states the code is benign, straightforward, with no malicious behavior.\n- The confidence is 0.9, which is high.\n- Malware score is 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- Security risk is 0.1, perhaps considering minimal potential for misuse, but overall very low.\n- No issues identified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar conclusion: benign, straightforward, no suspicious activity.\n- Confidence is 1, indicating certainty.\n- Malware score is 0.\n- Security risk is 0.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: benign, simple, no malicious intent.\n- Confidence is 1.\n- Malware score is 0.\n- Security risk is 0.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, benign, straightforward, no suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence is 1.\n- Malware score is 0.\n- Security risk is 0.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar assessment: benign, simple print function.\n- Confidence is 0.9.\n- Malware score is 0.\n- Security risk is 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Assessment:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Critical Review:\n- The code is extremely simple: a function concatenating a static prefix with input and printing.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n### Final Scores & Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on the reports and code analysis, I agree with the assessments provided. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscation concerns, and the risk is negligible.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of this simple print utility.",
