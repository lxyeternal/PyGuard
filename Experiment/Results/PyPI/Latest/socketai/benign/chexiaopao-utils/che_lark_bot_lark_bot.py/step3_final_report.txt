  "purpose": "A simple class to send messages via a webhook URL, used for notifications.",
  "sources": "The webhook URL provided externally during class instantiation; the message parameter in send_message method.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post call sends data over the network to the constructed URL; no untrusted data is directly used as code.",
  "flows": "Input webhook URL and message -> construct URL and JSON payload -> POST request -> response handling.",
  "anomalies": "The 'user' parameter in send_message is unused; no secrets or obfuscation present; URL constructed dynamically from user input.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a webhook notifier. It uses standard libraries, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The URL is built from user input, which could be misused if malicious, but this is typical for webhook clients. No malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious patterns are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is minimal (~0.1), justified by reliance on external webhook URL trust. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities. The only minor concern is the unused 'user' parameter, which does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. The minimal security risk stems from external trust in the webhook URL, not the code itself. Overall, the code is safe for use with standard precautions regarding webhook URL security.",
