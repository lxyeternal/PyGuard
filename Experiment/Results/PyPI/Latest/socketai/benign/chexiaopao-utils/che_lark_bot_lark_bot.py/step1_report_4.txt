{
  "purpose": "Define a class WxBot to send messages to a Lark (feishu) chat via a webhook URL.",
  "sources": "The webhook URL provided during initialization; the message parameter in send_message method.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post call which sends data over the network to a specified URL.",
  "flows": "The webhook URL is stored in self.webhook; send_message constructs a URL with this webhook and sends JSON data containing the message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the webhook URL is externally provided, reducing risk of hardcoded secrets. No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports requests and defines a class WxBot with an initializer that stores a webhook URL. The send_message method constructs a JSON payload and posts it to a constructed URL using the requests library. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL manipulations, or other malicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a webhook notifier for a chat application. No anomalies or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple webhook-based notifier for a chat application. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. No signs of malware, data leakage, or backdoors are present.",
