  "purpose": "A simple class to send messages via a Lark (Feishu) chatbot webhook",
  "sources": "The 'webhook' parameter provided during class initialization",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.post' call that sends data to the constructed URL, and the 'req.json()' response handling",
  "flows": "Input webhook URL -> 'send_message' method constructs URL -> POST request to Lark API -> response parsed as JSON",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code constructs a URL dynamically based on user input but does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for sending messages to a Lark chatbot via webhook URL provided at runtime. It uses standard requests library for HTTP POST, with no suspicious or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated code, no data exfiltration, and no system manipulation observed. The dynamic URL formation based on user input is normal for webhook implementations. No external or suspicious data sources or sinks are identified beyond the expected API call.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a webhook message sender for Lark/Feishu, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It relies on the user providing the correct webhook URL. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware.",
