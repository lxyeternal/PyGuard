  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward webhook message sender for Lark/Feishu, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- The primary concern is the use of user-supplied webhook URLs, which is standard but could pose risks if misused.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident.\n- The code relies on the requests library for network communication, which is typical and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware.\n- The use of user-controlled webhook URLs is expected but could be misused if the URL points to malicious endpoints; however, this is a common pattern in webhook integrations.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No coding flaws or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The code does not validate or sanitize the webhook URL, but this is standard for such simple clients.\n- No errors or logic flaws are present.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, acknowledging potential misuse of user-provided URLs, which is reasonable.\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly high (1 or 0.9), consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justifications:\n- Since the code is purely a message sender with no malicious code, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score could be slightly higher if considering the potential for misuse of arbitrary webhook URLs, but given the context, the current scores seem reasonable.\n- No report suggests any assumptions that could be challenged; all are consistent with a benign implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for misuse of user-supplied URLs, a score around 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting minimal but real concern.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a simple, legitimate webhook message sender with no malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the use of user-controlled URLs, which is standard but warrants caution.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code, with a minor security concern due to the reliance on user-provided webhook URLs.",
