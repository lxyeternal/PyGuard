  "purpose": "A simple Python class to send messages via a Lark (WxBot) webhook.",
  "sources": "The 'webhook' parameter in __init__, the message parameter in send_message.",
  "sinks": "requests.post call that sends data to a constructed URL with potential user-controlled webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Webhook URL input -> stored in self.webhook -> used to construct URL in send_message -> message content sent as JSON payload.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code structures, no obfuscated code. Use of user-controlled webhook URL could pose risk if misused but is expected functionality.",
  "analysis": "The class accepts a webhook URL during initialization and uses it to send messages via HTTP POST requests with JSON payload. The webhook URL is supplied by the user, which is normal for webhook integrations but could be misused if the URL is maliciously controlled. There are no hardcoded secrets, no code injections, and no suspicious external connections beyond the intended API call. The code appears straightforward, with proper use of the requests library and timeout handling. No anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward messaging bot interface to Lark's webhook API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. Its main potential security concern is reliance on user-provided webhook URLs, which is expected for webhook integrations but should be used carefully to avoid misuse.",
