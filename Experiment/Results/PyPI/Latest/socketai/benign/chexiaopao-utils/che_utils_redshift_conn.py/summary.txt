  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for SQL statement generation, free of malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the lack of parameterized queries, which exposes potential for SQL injection if inputs are untrusted. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly assigned as 0. The risk score should be around 0.6, reflecting moderate security risk due to injection vulnerabilities. To improve security, refactoring to use parameterized queries is recommended. The current code is benign but requires caution in usage."
