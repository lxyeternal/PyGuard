{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for generating SQL statements such as CREATE TABLE, INSERT, batch INSERT, and UPDATE for database operations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters: table_name, insert_item, insert_items, up_item, and condition.",
  "sinks": "SQL query strings constructed within each function, which could be executed against a database.",
  "flows": "Input data (parameters) flows into string formatting functions that produce SQL statements, which are potential sinks for malicious input.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs basic escaping of string values by doubling single quotes, but does not sanitize or validate input beyond this; no apparent hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The functions generate SQL statements based on provided input dictionaries. The escaping of single quotes in strings reduces some SQL injection risk but does not eliminate it, as no parameterized queries or input validation are implemented. No malicious behavior such as network communication, file modification, or data exfiltration is present. The code structure is straightforward, and no suspicious or hidden code patterns are detected. It primarily focuses on string manipulation to build SQL commands, which is common in application code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard SQL utility functions for dynamic SQL generation. While it has basic string escaping to prevent simple SQL injection, it lacks more robust security measures such as parameterized queries. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior in this code segment.",
