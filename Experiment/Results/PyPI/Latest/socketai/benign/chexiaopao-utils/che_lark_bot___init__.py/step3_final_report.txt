  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only header comments with metadata, such as encoding, timestamp, and author, and no executable code.",
  "sources": "The comments themselves serve as the source of data; no external data sources or input points are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code is non-executable comments.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist since there is no executable code; the code consists solely of comments with no data processing or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present in the comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely comments with metadata; all reports correctly identify the absence of executable or malicious content. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with high confidence. No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected. The code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of header comments. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with its non-executable nature. No further action or concern is warranted.",
