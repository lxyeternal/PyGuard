{
  "purpose": "A simple function that prepends 'che' to input text and prints it.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' passed to pppprint function.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs concatenated string to standard output.",
  "flows": "Data flows directly from 'text' parameter to the print output without modification or external access.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'pppprint' that concatenates 'che' with the input 'text' and prints it. There are no external data reads, network activity, or malicious behaviors. The code is simple, benign, and free of obfuscation. The only minor note is the function name and comments, which do not impact security. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate, reflecting minimal risk due to untrusted input potential but no actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a trivial print utility with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring is consistent with the code's simplicity. No changes are necessary.",
