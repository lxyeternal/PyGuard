{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function to print a modified version of the input text.",
  "sources": "The function takes a string argument 'text'.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statement outputs data to the console.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows into the 'pppprint' function, then concatenates with 'che' and prints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single function that prepends 'che' to any provided input and prints it. The function is straightforward with no input validation, external data sources, or network activity. The metadata comments suggest a timestamp and author, but they do not influence code behavior. No malicious intent or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely outputs a string with a prefix. The overall security risk is minimal.",
