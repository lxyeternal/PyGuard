{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function to print a string with a prefix.",
  "sources": "The function pppprint receives input 'text' from any caller, which could potentially be untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs data directly to standard output via print(), which is generally safe but could be misused if the input is maliciously crafted to exploit the environment where output is captured or processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameter 'text' to the print statement after concatenation with a static string 'che'.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'pppprint' appears unusual and redundant; the code includes a timestamp and author comments that do not influence behavior but are unnecessary. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, non-obfuscated function that prints a prefixed string. No external data sources, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. There are no signs of malicious intent or behavior. The function could be misused if untrusted input is printed in a context where it could cause formatting issues, but this is a common benign pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic print function with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or security threats. The overall risk is minimal.",
