  "purpose": "A simple function to print a modified version of input text, likely for debugging or display purposes.",
  "sources": "The function reads its input parameter 'text'.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data is transmitted externally beyond console output.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is concatenated with 'che' and printed; no external data sources or network interactions involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code is straightforward and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that prepends 'che' to the input text and prints it. There are no external data sources, no network activity, and no security-sensitive operations. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a basic print utility with no security issues.",
