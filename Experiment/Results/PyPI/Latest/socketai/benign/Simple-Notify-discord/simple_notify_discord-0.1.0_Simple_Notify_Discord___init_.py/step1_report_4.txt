{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports a class or function named Simple_Notify_Discord from a relative module and defines an __all__ list for export.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement from a local module (.Simple_Notify_Discord) and the __all__ list definition.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing a component and exposing it through __all__, with no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The __all__ list contains a string 'Simple-Notify-discord' which differs from the imported symbol's name 'Simple_Notify_Discord', potentially indicating an inconsistency or typo but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import and defines an export list. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The mismatch between the imported symbol name and the string in __all__ could be a typo but is not inherently malicious. The code is minimal and structurally normal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import and export setup with no malicious intent detected. The only anomaly is the naming mismatch in __all__, which appears to be a typo rather than malicious behavior.",
