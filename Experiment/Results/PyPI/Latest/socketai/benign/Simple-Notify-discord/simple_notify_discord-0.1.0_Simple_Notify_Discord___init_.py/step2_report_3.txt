  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and an __all__ declaration.\n   - The main concern across reports is the inconsistency in naming: the imported symbol is `Simple_Notify_Discord`, while the __all__ string is `'Simple-Notify-discord'` (with hyphens). This mismatch is likely a typo or misconfiguration.\n   - No report indicates any actual malicious behavior, data leakage, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the naming inconsistency as a probable typo.\n   - They appropriately conclude that there are no signs of malicious activity.\n   - The reports do not overstate the risk; they recognize the potential for runtime errors due to naming mismatches but not security issues.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - `securityRisk` scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), consistent with the minimal code and lack of vulnerabilities.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The `confidence` scores are high (mostly ≥ 0.8), reflecting the clear understanding that this is a benign, minimal snippet with a likely typo.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No report justifies any risk score higher than 0.5, which is correct given the evidence.\n   - The only potential concern is the typo in __all__, which could cause runtime errors but not security risks.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they only identify the typo and its implications.\n   - They do not suggest any vulnerabilities that are purely speculative.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analyses.\n   - The low security risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n  No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n  Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.\n\n- **Risk:** **0.1**  \n  The only concern is a typo in __all__, which could cause runtime errors but not security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a simple import/export declaration with a typo in the __all__ string. There is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk present. The main issue is the inconsistency in naming, which should be corrected to prevent runtime errors.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nCorrect the __all__ list to match the imported symbol, e.g., `'Simple_Notify_Discord'`, to avoid potential import or usage errors. No security concerns are associated with this code snippet.",
