  "anomalies": "The __all__ list contains 'Simple-Notify-discord' with hyphens, which does not match the imported symbol 'Simple_Notify_Discord' and is invalid as a Python identifier",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module and defines __all__ for export. The only issue is the inconsistency and invalid syntax in the __all__ string, which is likely a typo. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The typo could cause runtime import errors but does not introduce security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with a minor naming inconsistency in __all__ that should be corrected. No malware or security risks are detected. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate, though the typo should be fixed to prevent runtime errors.",
