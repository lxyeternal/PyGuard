  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue Confirmed?** Yes. The code imports a local module and defines __all__.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The __all__ string 'Simple-Notify-discord' contains hyphens, which are invalid in Python identifiers. This is likely a typo or naming inconsistency.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No malicious activity detected. The typo could cause runtime errors but not security issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue Confirmed?** Yes. Same as above, with a typo in __all__.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No malicious intent, just a naming inconsistency.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue Confirmed?** Yes. Same typo in __all__.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No signs of malicious behavior; just a likely typo.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue Confirmed?** Yes. Same typo in __all__.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No malicious activity, just a naming mismatch.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue Confirmed?** Yes. Same typo.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 — slightly higher, but still low.\n- **Comments:** No malicious activity; the small security risk score might reflect the potential for runtime errors due to naming mismatch, but not a security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's content—no malicious code, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports, correct.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0 or very low (0.1), reflecting the minor issue of a typo in __all__.\n\n**Critical observations:**\n- The main \"issue\" across all reports is the typo in the __all__ string ('Simple-Notify-discord' instead of 'Simple_Notify_Discord'). This is a naming inconsistency that could cause import or runtime errors but is not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not handle untrusted data or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust the __all__ string** to match the actual symbol name: `'Simple_Notify_Discord'`.\n- **Update the report scores** if necessary, but current scores are reasonable given the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minor typo risk, but no security concern)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with a minor naming typo that should be corrected for proper module exports. No security risks or malware present.",
