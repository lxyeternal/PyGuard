{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be an import statement and an export of a module or class related to Discord notifications.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement: 'from .Simple_Notify_Discord import Simple_Notify_Discord'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it only imports a class or function and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or data processing; the code simply imports a symbol and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "The __all__ list contains a string 'Simple-Notify-discord', which does not match the imported symbol 'Simple_Notify_Discord'. This discrepancy may indicate a typo or misconfiguration but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Simple_Notify_Discord' from a relative module, then sets __all__ to include a string that resembles a module name but uses hyphens instead of underscores. No other code or logic is present. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are evident. The mismatch in naming conventions could lead to runtime errors but does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import and export statement with a potential naming inconsistency. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
