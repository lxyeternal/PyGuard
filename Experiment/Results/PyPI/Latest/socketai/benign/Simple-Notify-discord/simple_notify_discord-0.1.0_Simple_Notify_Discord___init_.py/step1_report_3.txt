  "purpose": "Re-exporting the Simple_Notify_Discord class or module for external use",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module Simple_Notify_Discord",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this is a simple import and export statement",
  "anomalies": "Incorrect __all__ value: uses hyphens instead of underscores, which is invalid in Python identifiers; potential typo or misconfiguration",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named Simple_Notify_Discord from the current package and sets the __all__ attribute with a string. The __all__ list is intended to define public API symbols. However, the string 'Simple-Notify-discord' contains hyphens, which are invalid in Python variable names and could cause import or module export issues. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The code itself is minimal and straightforward, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import and export setup. The only concern is the __all__ string which likely should use underscores ('Simple_Notify_Discord') instead of hyphens. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected.",
