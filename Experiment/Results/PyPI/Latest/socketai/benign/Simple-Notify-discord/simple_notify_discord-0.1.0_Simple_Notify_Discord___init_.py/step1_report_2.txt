  "purpose": "Export the Simple_Notify_Discord class or function from the current module for external use.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .Simple_Notify_Discord indicates reading the module or package named Simple_Notify_Discord within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The __all__ list contains 'Simple-Notify-discord', which appears to be a misspelling or inconsistent naming compared to the imported module 'Simple_Notify_Discord'. This inconsistency could lead to import or usage errors but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module named Simple_Notify_Discord and sets the __all__ variable to include 'Simple-Notify-discord', which differs from the actual imported module name due to hyphens instead of underscores. This mismatch is likely an error or typo rather than malicious intent. The code is minimal, with no input/output handling or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any operations beyond the import and export declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export statement with a possible typo in the __all__ list. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. The main concern is the naming inconsistency, which could lead to runtime errors, but not security issues.",
