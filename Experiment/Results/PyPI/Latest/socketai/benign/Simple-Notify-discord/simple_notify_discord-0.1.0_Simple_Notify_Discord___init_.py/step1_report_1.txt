  "purpose": "Export the Simple_Notify_Discord class or function from the current module for external use",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from .Simple_Notify_Discord module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; the code only performs an import and an __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "The __all__ list contains a typo ('Simple-Notify-discord' instead of a valid identifier; typically underscores are used), which may cause issues but not malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module named Simple_Notify_Discord, likely a class or function. It then defines __all__ with a string that appears to be a typo or inconsistency in naming convention. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing. The code is minimal and appears standard for module exports. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module import and export declaration with a potential typo in the __all__ list. There are no indications of malicious activity or security risks.",
