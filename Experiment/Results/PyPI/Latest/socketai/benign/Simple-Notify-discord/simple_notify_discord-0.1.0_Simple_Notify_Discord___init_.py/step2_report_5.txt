  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports focus on a very minimal code snippet: a local import and an __all__ declaration.\n- The main issue across reports is the inconsistent naming in the __all__ string ('Simple-Notify-discord') versus the imported symbol ('Simple_Notify_Discord').\n- No signs of malicious activity, data leaks, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The code is standard for module exports, with no data flows, sinks, or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The only potential issue is the typo or inconsistency in the __all__ string, which could cause runtime errors if used improperly. However, this is a coding mistake, not a security concern.\n\n### Malware and security risk:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- Security risk scores are also 0 or very low, consistent with the absence of any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Reasoning and scores:\n- The reports' confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8-1), which is justified given the simplicity.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The malware scores are 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- The security risk scores are 0 or very low, aligning with the analysis.\n\n### Potential corrections:\n- The main correction needed is to update the __all__ string to match the imported symbol name, e.g., `'Simple_Notify_Discord'`, to prevent import/export errors.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)  \n\nThe existing scores are reasonable, but I would suggest **keeping the malware and obfuscated scores at 0** and the risk at 0, given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign, with a minor typo in the __all__ list.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n- The main concern is the typo, which should be corrected for proper module exports.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the existing scores and conclusions.**",
