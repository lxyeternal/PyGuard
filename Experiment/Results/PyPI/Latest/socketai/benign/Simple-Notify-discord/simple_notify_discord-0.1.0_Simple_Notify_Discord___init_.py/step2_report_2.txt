  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the consistency of their scoring, and any potential security implications.\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is minimal: it imports a local module `Simple_Notify_Discord` and defines `__all__` with a string that appears to be a typo or inconsistency.\n- No data flows, sinks, or external data handling are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n- The primary concern noted is the mismatch between the imported symbol `Simple_Notify_Discord` and the string `'Simple-Notify-discord'` in `__all__`. This is likely a typo or naming inconsistency, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The `__all__` list contains `'Simple-Notify-discord'` with hyphens, which is invalid as a Python identifier. It should match the imported symbol name or follow valid naming conventions.\n\n### Are the reported issues present?\n- **Yes.** All reports correctly identify the inconsistency in `__all__`. No report claims the presence of malicious code, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly note that the core code is harmless and minimal.\n- The primary flaw is the typo or inconsistency in `__all__`. No report explicitly suggests correcting it, but they mention it as a concern.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports, justified.\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports, justified.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 or near-zero, justified, since there's no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence levels:** Range from 0.8 to 1, appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Should any scores be adjusted?\n- The `malware` score remains 0, which is correct.\n- The `securityRisk` score is low, which is appropriate.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, justified.\n- The main concern is the typo in `__all__`, which is a coding mistake but not a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The inconsistent naming in `__all__` could cause runtime errors if the module is imported elsewhere, but it does not pose a security threat.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should remain **0**.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay **0**.\n- The **security risk** should remain **0**.\n- The **main issue** is the typo in `__all__`, which should be corrected for proper functionality, but it does not affect security.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\nThe code is standard, with a minor typo that should be fixed but does not pose a security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The only notable issue is the naming inconsistency in `__all__`, which is a coding mistake rather than a security vulnerability. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks.",
