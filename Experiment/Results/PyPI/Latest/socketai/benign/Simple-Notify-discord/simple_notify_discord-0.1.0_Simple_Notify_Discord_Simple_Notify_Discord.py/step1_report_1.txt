  "purpose": "Send notifications to a Discord webhook, optionally mentioning a user.",
  "sources": "self.webhook_url and self.user_id are hardcoded values used as input data.",
  "sinks": "requests.post to the webhook_url with a JSON payload containing the message.",
  "flows": "The message is constructed and sent via HTTP POST to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded webhook URL and user ID; no input validation; potential for misuse if webhook URL is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for sending notifications to a Discord webhook. It contains hardcoded credentials (webhook URL and user ID), which are security risks if exposed. The function constructs a message, optionally prepending a user ID when mention is True, and sends it via an HTTP POST request using the requests library. There is no validation of the URL or message content, but no evidence of malicious code execution or data exfiltration. The webhook URL being hardcoded could be exploited if leaked. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward notification sender with no malicious intent, but it hardcodes sensitive data, which could pose security risks if exposed. No malicious behavior or malware is detected.",
