  "purpose": "Send notifications to a Discord webhook with optional user mention.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'webhook_url' and 'user_id' attributes, and the 'message' parameter.",
  "sinks": "POST request to 'self.webhook_url' with JSON payload containing the message.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'webhook_url', 'user_id', and 'message' flows into the 'notify_discord' method; the message is sent via a POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The 'webhook_url' and 'user_id' are hardcoded as placeholder strings; no validation or sanitization of these values. The code directly posts to the URL without any security checks. No apparent obfuscation or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class to send notifications to a Discord webhook. The 'webhook_url' and 'user_id' are hardcoded placeholders, which could be replaced with actual credentials or URLs, but there is no indication of malicious intent. The method constructs a JSON payload and sends it via HTTP POST. No data leaks, credential theft, or malicious behavior are evident. The code does not perform any network reconnaissance, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. Overall, the code appears to be a benign notification utility with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward notification sender to a Discord webhook. It contains no malicious behavior or malware indicators. The presence of placeholder strings for sensitive data suggests incomplete or sample code rather than malicious intent. No security risks are identified in this implementation.",
