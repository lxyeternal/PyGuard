  "conclusion": "The code's design enables remote code execution through unsafe eval() and dynamic class resolution on untrusted input, especially over network interfaces. This constitutes a severe supply chain security vulnerability. The current pattern should be replaced with safer alternatives, such as explicit whitelists, factory patterns, or sandboxed evaluation, to mitigate remote code execution risks. The malware score should be set to 1, and the overall security risk should be rated at or near 1, reflecting the critical vulnerability present."
