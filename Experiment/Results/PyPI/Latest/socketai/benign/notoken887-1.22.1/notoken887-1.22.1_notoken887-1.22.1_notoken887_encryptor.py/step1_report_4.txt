{
  "purpose": "A simple token encryption and decryption utility that substitutes specific characters and reverses strings.",
  "sources": "The 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, which take input tokens as parameters.",
  "sinks": "The return statements that output transformed or decrypted tokens; potential for misuse if integrated improperly, but no direct data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Input token → character substitution via replacement/decryption table → string reversal → output; the reverse process during decryption.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses character substitution and reversal, which is a very basic obfuscation method. No external data access, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code is present. No suspicious imports or obfuscated code features. The code appears straightforward and lacks external side effects.",
  "analysis": "The class provides simple reversible encoding by substituting specific characters with special symbols and reversing the string. No input validation, external communication, or complex logic. It does not contain malicious functions or behaviors. The code appears to be a benign obfuscation or encoding utility with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic reversible character substitution and string reversal utility. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It functions as intended for simple obfuscation. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
