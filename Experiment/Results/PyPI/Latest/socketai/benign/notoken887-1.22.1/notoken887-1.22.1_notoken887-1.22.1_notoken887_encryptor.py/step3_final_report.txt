  "purpose": "Implements a reversible substitution cipher with string reversal for simple obfuscation or encoding.",
  "sources": "Static lookup tables for character substitution; input token to encrypt/decrypt functions.",
  "sinks": "Reversal operations and character replacements; no external data or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input token -> substitution table -> reverse -> output (encrypt); reverse -> substitution table -> output (decrypt).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with static tables and reversible operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a basic substitution cipher with static lookup tables and string reversal, with no external dependencies, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It is designed for simple obfuscation, not security. The substitution tables are static, and the methods perform character replacement and reversal in a predictable manner. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code's weakness is its cryptographic simplicity, but this does not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for reversible obfuscation with no malicious intent or behavior. The static substitution cipher and reversal are simple and easily reversible, posing minimal security risk. The reports accurately assess the code, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
