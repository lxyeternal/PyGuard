{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple reversible token transformation using character substitution and string reversal, likely for obfuscation or encoding purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'token' for the encrypt method, and 'encrypted_token' for the decrypt method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any external data sinks or network operations; it only processes and returns transformed strings.",
  "flows": "Input token → character substitution → string reversal (encryption); Encrypted token → string reversal → character substitution (decryption).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no external data handling, or obfuscation techniques present. The logic is straightforward and self-contained.",
  "analysis": "The class performs a simple character substitution using predefined tables, then reverses the string for encryption, and reverses again for decryption. No external inputs other than method arguments, no network or file I/O, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be intended for basic obfuscation or encoding rather than malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, implementing a straightforward reversible substitution cipher with string reversal. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
