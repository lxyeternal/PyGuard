{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be simple token encryption and decryption through character substitution and string reversal.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the 'token' parameter in 'encrypt' and 'encrypted_token' in 'decrypt' methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems or files, nor does it execute untrusted input directly. No external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input token -> character substitution via replacement_table -> string reversal -> output (encrypted token); Encrypted token -> reverse string -> character substitution via decryption_table -> output (decrypted token).",
  "anomalies": "The code performs only simple character substitution and string reversal with no network access, system commands, or data leaks. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The method is simplistic and easily reversible but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The class implements basic symmetric 'encryption' using character replacement and string reversal. The substitution tables are static and straightforward. No external dependencies, no network communication, no code injection, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is simple and unlikely to be malicious but also offers minimal security and could be used maliciously if misused for obfuscation. No anomalies suggest malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides a basic reversible encoding mechanism with no evident malicious intent. It does not perform any harmful operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. It is a simple encoding utility without malicious features.",
