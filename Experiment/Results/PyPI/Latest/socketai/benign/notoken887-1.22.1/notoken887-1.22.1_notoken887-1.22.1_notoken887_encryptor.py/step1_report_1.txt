{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution encryption and decryption for tokens using hardcoded lookup tables, with a reversal step for obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input tokens to the encrypt and decrypt methods",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data to external systems or leak data",
  "flows": "Input token -> substitution and reversal in encrypt method; encrypted token -> reversal and substitution in decrypt method",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks; simple substitution cipher with reversal is not secure but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The class defines static lookup tables for character substitution, with methods to encrypt (substitute characters and reverse) and decrypt (reverse and substitute back). No external input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity are present. The cipher used is weak and could be considered for malicious obfuscation, but it is not inherently malicious or harmful. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a basic reversible substitution cipher with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a simple obfuscation tool rather than malware. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security threats are evident.",
