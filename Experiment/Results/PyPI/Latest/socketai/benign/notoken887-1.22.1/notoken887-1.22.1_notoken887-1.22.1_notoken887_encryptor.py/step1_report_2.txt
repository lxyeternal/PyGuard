  "purpose": "The class provides simple token encryption and decryption functions based on character substitution and string reversal.",
  "sources": "Input to encrypt() and decrypt() methods (the token parameter).",
  "sinks": "Returns from encrypt() and decrypt() methods; potential misuse if data is assumed secure.",
  "flows": "Input token -> substitution/encryption -> reversal -> output; Encrypted token -> reversal -> substitution/decryption -> output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of straightforward substitution cipher with reversal; no external data sources; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity or system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple substitution cipher with a reversal step for both encrypt and decrypt functions. There are no external data dependencies, no system calls, and no obfuscated or malicious code structures. The substitution tables are static and do not involve sensitive information. The encryption scheme is very weak cryptographically but does not indicate malicious intent; it appears to be for obfuscation or simple encoding. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious payloads, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a basic reversible substitution cipher with string reversal. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be intended for simple encoding or obfuscation rather than security. No malicious activity or malware is detected.",
