  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools with no dynamic or malicious code.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static metadata fields in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; no external data or code execution occurs.",
  "flows": "None; setup metadata is static and not influenced by external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') are unprofessional and potentially malicious in intent, but do not affect code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with static metadata. No dynamic code, input handling, or obfuscation is present. The only suspicious elements are the author email and URL, which raise red flags but do not constitute malicious code. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score varies from 0.2 to 0.4 across reports, primarily reflecting metadata suspicion rather than code-based threats. Confidence in benign code is high (above 0.8). The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's actual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The primary concern is the suspicious metadata, which warrants caution but does not indicate active malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate and justified, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and a low to moderate risk score based on metadata suspicion.",
