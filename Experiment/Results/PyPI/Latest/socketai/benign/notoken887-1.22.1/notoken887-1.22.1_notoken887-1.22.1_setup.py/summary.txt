  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The primary concern is the suspicious metadata, which warrants caution but does not indicate active malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate and justified, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and a low to moderate risk score based on metadata suspicion."
