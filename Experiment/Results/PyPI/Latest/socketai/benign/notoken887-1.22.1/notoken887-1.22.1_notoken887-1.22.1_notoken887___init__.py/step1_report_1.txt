  "sinks": "Potential output points such as network transmissions, file writes, or system commands (not visible in the provided snippet).",
  "flows": "Data flow paths from sources to sinks are unclear due to the absence of actual code, but typically involve untrusted inputs passing through processing functions and reaching outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected due to lack of code. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or obfuscated patterns visible.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited by the absence of actual code content. Based on standard structure, no suspicious or malicious patterns are evident. No hardcoded secrets, unusual behaviors, or obfuscated code are observed. The code appears to be straightforward or placeholder, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient code provided to identify malicious behavior or security risks. Based on the available information, the code shows no signs of malware or security issues. Further review requires the actual code content.",
