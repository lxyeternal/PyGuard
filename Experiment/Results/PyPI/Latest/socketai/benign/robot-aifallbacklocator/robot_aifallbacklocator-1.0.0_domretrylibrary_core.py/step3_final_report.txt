  "purpose": "Python class for a Robot Framework library managing AI interactions, locators, and caching, loading API keys from environment variables or constructor args, masking keys in logs, and handling exceptions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for API keys, external API calls to OpenAI, file I/O for cache files, logging outputs.",
  "sinks": "Logging masked API keys, API requests to external servers, exception handling outputs.",
  "flows": "API key retrieval from env or args -> masked in logs -> used in API requests -> potential error logs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API key management, external API interactions, and logging with exception handling. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The masking of API keys in logs is a common practice, though care should be taken in sensitive environments. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to environment variable handling, which is typical for such integrations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects minor concerns about API key handling and logging practices, which are standard and acceptable in this context.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
