{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Robot Framework library for AI-assisted locator fallback using OpenAI's GPT models, managing dependencies, environment variables, and caching.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'OPENAI_API_KEY' (via load_dotenv), constructor parameters, and potentially untrusted inputs passed to keywords.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions, external API calls via AIProcessor, and file operations for cache management.",
  "flows": "The API key is read from environment or constructor; used in AIProcessor API calls. Inputs to 'ai_fallback_locator' are processed and passed to external AI API. Cache clearing modifies local storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. API key is dynamically loaded; no malicious code or obfuscation detected. No unusual network connections or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes dependencies securely, loads environment variables, and manages API keys with masking for logs. The key functions interface with external APIs and manage local cache files. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of environment variables and external API calls appears standard and intended for legitimate AI functionalities. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate library for AI-based locator fallback with standard security practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks in this snippet.",
