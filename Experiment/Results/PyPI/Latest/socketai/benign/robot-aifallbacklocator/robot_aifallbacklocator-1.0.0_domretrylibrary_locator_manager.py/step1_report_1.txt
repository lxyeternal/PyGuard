{
  "purpose": "Manages storage and retrieval of locator comparison data, including saving, loading, and clearing comparison history.",
  "sources": "File system (reading/writing 'locator_comparison.json', removing file), user inputs could influence locator data passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "File system (writes to 'locator_comparison.json', deletes file), logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Data from locator parameters flows into JSON storage, which is then read back or deleted as needed. No external network communication is present.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code handles exceptions gracefully. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic. No obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a JSON file if present, appends locator comparison data with timestamps, and writes back to the file. It can clear history by deleting the file or overwriting it with an empty list. The logging outputs are for debugging or informational purposes. No external network or system modification is performed. The code uses standard libraries and proper exception handling. The data storage mechanism appears benign and solely for tracking locator comparisons.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward locator comparison tracker with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform network activities, nor does it handle sensitive credentials or perform harmful operations. The overall risk level is very low.",
