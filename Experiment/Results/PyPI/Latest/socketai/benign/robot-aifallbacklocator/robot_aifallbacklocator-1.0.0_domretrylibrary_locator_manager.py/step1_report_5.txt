  "purpose": "Manage and store locator comparison data for robot tests, including loading, storing, retrieving, and clearing history.",
  "sources": "File system operations (reading/writing JSON files, removing files), environment variables (not used here), logger outputs.",
  "sinks": "File write operations (json.dump), file delete (os.remove), logger outputs to console and logs.",
  "flows": "Data is read from JSON files or memory (load comparisons), stored into JSON files (store_locator_comparison), retrieved from memory (get_historical_locators), or deleted (clear_history).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious data leaks, no obfuscated code, no unusual or malicious network activity, and no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code manages locator comparison data using JSON files. It performs standard file I/O with exception handling. It logs various actions but does not process untrusted data beyond reading/writing JSON data. No external network activity, no secret data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior detected. The operations are straightforward and consistent with normal data management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data management utility with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It performs expected file operations and logging without any malicious or suspicious activities.",
