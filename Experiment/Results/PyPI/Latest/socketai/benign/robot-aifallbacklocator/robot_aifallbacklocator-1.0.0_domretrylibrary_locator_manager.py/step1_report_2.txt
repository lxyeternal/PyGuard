  "purpose": "Manage storage and comparison of locators, including saving, loading, and clearing locator comparison data.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'locator_comparison.json' file, user-provided locator data via method arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'locator_comparison.json', file deletion or creation, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Loading data from file -> storing new locator comparisons -> retrieving comparisons -> clearing/deleting the storage file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation. Use of logging and file operations appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file read/write operations for managing locator comparison data. It handles exceptions properly, avoiding crashes. No untrusted data sources such as network inputs or environment variables are involved. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are detected. The functions are typical for persistent storage handling in testing or automation environments. No signs of malware, code injection, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign locator management utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It safely handles file operations and data logging without exposing sensitive data or performing harmful actions.",
