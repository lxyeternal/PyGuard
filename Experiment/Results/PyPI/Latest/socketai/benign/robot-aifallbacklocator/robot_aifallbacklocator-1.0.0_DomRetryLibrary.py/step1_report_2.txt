  "purpose": "Importing the DomRetryLibrary class from the domretrylibrary.core module, likely for retry logic or similar functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from an external library",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as code does not process data beyond import and version declaration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a specific class from an external library and defines a version string. There is no data processing, input/output handling, or suspicious behavior. The imported library's source and its potential maliciousness are not evaluated here, but the code itself appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with a version declaration and shows no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
