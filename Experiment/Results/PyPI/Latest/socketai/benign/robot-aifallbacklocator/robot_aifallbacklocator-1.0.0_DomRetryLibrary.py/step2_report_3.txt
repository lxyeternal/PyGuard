  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of import statements and a version string assignment.\n   - No functions, data processing, network activity, or other suspicious operations are present.\n   - The import is from a package named `domretrylibrary.core`, which appears to be an external dependency.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n   - They appropriately note the absence of hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The conclusion that the code is safe and minimal is consistent with the code snippets.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Mostly low (0 or 0.1), which aligns with the minimal, benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume malicious intent beyond the code snippet, which is correct.\n   - They acknowledge that the actual behavior of `domretrylibrary` cannot be assessed here, but the code itself is safe.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code only imports a library and sets a version, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity.\n   - The dependency `domretrylibrary` could be malicious, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet and should be assessed separately.\n\n**Summary of Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No changes are necessary based on the provided information.\n- The risk scores should remain low, given the minimal code and benign analysis.\n\n**My Overall Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal security risk due to import of external library, but no malicious activity)\n\n**Final Note:**\n- The critical aspect is the trustworthiness of `domretrylibrary`. Since the code only imports it, the main concern shifts to whether this dependency is malicious or compromised. That assessment requires separate review of the package itself, not just this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are needed based on this minimal code snippet.",
