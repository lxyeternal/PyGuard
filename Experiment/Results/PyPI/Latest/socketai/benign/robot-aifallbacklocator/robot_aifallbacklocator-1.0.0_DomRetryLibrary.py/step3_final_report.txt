  "purpose": "Minimal import of a class from an external library and setting a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'domretrylibrary.core' and the version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "None; the code only imports and sets a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, containing only an import statement and a version string. No functions, data processing, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. The import appears standard, assuming the library is legitimate. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues is detected. The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment. The potential concern about the trustworthiness of 'domretrylibrary' is outside the scope of this snippet; based solely on the code, the risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
