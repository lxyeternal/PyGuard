  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code content, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Content Summary:**\nThe code is minimal:\n```python\nfrom domretrylibrary.core import DomRetryLibrary\n\n__version__ = \"1.0.0\"\n```\nIt only imports a class from an external library and sets a version string. There are no functions, data flows, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import and version assignment.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states the code is minimal with no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.8, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate. The confidence is slightly high but justified given the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Import class for retry logic.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; code is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores seem reasonable. The zero malware score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Import class and set version.\n- **Analysis:** Minimal, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Import class for DOM operations.\n- **Analysis:** Same benign conclusion.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Import module and set version.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score is reasonable, given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- **Code presence:** The code snippet is very straightforward; no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), which is acceptable for minimal import code, though arguably could be 0 since no security issues are present.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** Overall, the scores are consistent with the code snippet.\n- **Potential improvements:** Since the code is trivial, the security risk could be uniformly set to 0 for clarity, but the current scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk from this code snippet)\n\n**Summary:** All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this minimal import code. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** If further context or code beyond this minimal snippet exists, reassessment would be necessary. But based solely on this, the current evaluation is appropriate.",
