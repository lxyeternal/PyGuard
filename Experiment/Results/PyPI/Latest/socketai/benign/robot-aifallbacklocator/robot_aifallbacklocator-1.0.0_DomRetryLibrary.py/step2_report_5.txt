  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the validity of conclusions.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe minimal code: just import statements and version assignments.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources beyond import statements.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code snippets are extremely simple and standard for setting up dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n\n**Code Content:**\n```python\nfrom domretrylibrary.core import DomRetryLibrary\n\n__version__ = \"1.0.0\"\n```\n- The code only imports a module/class and sets a version string.\n- No malicious code, no network activity, no data processing.\n- The import appears straightforward, assuming the package is legitimate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No issues are present in the code itself.** All reports correctly identify this.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing the reasoning, logic, and summaries:\n\n- All reports conclude the code is benign, with no suspicious activity.\n- They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n**No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.**\n\n---\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- Since there's no evidence of malicious intent, this is appropriate.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n**Security Risk Score:**\n- All reports assign very low risk scores (0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal risk.\n- Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, these scores are reasonable.\n\n**Scores consistency:**\n- The scores align well with the analysis.\n- No report seems to overstate or understate the risk.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- The reports mention importing from a third-party library but do not evaluate the library's trustworthiness.\n- The actual behavior of `domretrylibrary` cannot be assessed here; the reports focus only on the snippet.\n- If the library itself is malicious, the import could be a vector, but based solely on this code snippet, no evidence suggests that.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The code is benign, and the scores reflect that.\n- The high confidence levels are justified.\n- No modifications needed unless additional context about the library's trustworthiness is provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Issue | Presence | Reasoning |\n|--------|------------|------------|\n| Malicious activity | No | No suspicious code or behavior. |\n| Obfuscation | No | Clear, straightforward code. |\n| Risk level | Very low | No vulnerabilities or malicious intent detected. |\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to dependency import, but minimal)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWithout further code or context, the import statements and version assignment are safe. The scores and conclusions in the reports are appropriate and consistent.",
