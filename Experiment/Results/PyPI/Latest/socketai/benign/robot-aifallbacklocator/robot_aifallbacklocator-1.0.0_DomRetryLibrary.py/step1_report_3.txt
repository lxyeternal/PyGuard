  "purpose": "Import the DomRetryLibrary class from the domretrylibrary.core module and set the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a class from an external library.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed; only import and version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of an import statement and a version assignment. There are no inputs, data processing, or outputs that could be exploited. The import appears standard for including a library class, and the version string is typical. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears benign, serving only to import a library component and define a version. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
