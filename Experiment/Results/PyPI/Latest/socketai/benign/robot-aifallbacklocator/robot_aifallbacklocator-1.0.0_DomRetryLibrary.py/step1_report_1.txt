  "purpose": "Importing the DomRetryLibrary module from the domretrylibrary.core package and defining the version.",
  "sources": "Import statement from domretrylibrary.core",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data handling or output functions",
  "flows": "No data flow beyond import and version assignment",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious operations",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement and a version string assignment. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or other operations that could indicate malicious intent. The import appears to bring in a library named 'domretrylibrary', but without further code, its behavior cannot be assessed. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward, performing an import and defining a version string. No malicious activity or security issues are detectable here.",
