  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Evidence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a simple import statement from `domretrylibrary.core` and a version string assignment.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or other suspicious activities.\n   - The code snippets are minimal and do not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n   - Based solely on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The reasoning that the code is harmless is sound given the minimal snippet.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Mostly low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable since the code does not perform any risky operations.\n   - **Confidence Scores:** High (0.8 to 1), reflecting the certainty that the code is benign.\n   \n   These scores seem appropriate given the evidence.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Justifications:**\n   - Since the code is only an import and version declaration, the risk is negligible.\n   - The only caveat is that the actual `domretrylibrary` could be malicious, but this cannot be determined from the import statement alone. However, the reports correctly do not attribute maliciousness to the library without further evidence.\n   \n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the minimal code snippet and do not speculate beyond what is visible.\n   \n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal risk, mostly due to import of external library, but no direct threat evident)\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- If the library `domretrylibrary` is known to be trustworthy, the overall risk remains very low.\n- If the library source is unknown or suspicious, further investigation into the library itself would be warranted, but based on this snippet alone, no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the current scores are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.",
