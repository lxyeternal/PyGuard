{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Robot Framework library named DomRetryLibrary, intended to enhance test reliability by using AI to generate locators dynamically when primary locators fail.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module imports, version, author info, and the get_library_instance() function which instantiates DomRetryLibrary.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process or handle untrusted input data directly; it primarily creates an instance of a class and writes errors to standard error stream.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling get_library_instance(), which attempts to instantiate DomRetryLibrary and handles exceptions by writing to sys.stderr, but does not involve data from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior are present. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network activities. The code is straightforward, focusing solely on instantiating a class and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal library definition with version, author info, and a single function that creates an instance of DomRetryLibrary. It uses standard exception handling and writes errors to standard error. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The library’s purpose is well-defined, and there are no suspicious operations or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and solely serves as a wrapper to instantiate a Robot Framework library class with error handling. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
