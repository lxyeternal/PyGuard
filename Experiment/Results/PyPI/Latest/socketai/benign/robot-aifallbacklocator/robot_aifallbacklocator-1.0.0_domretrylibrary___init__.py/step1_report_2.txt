{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Robot Framework library called DomRetryLibrary, intended to enhance test reliability by using AI-powered fallback locators for web elements.",
  "sources": "The code imports the DomRetryLibrary class from a relative core module and defines a function to instantiate this class.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into security-sensitive operations; the code does not process external inputs directly.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling get_library_instance() to create a DomRetryLibrary object; however, no untrusted input influences this flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The comment about AI-powered fallback suggests external AI calls might be involved in the actual library implementation, but that is not visible here.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing a class and providing a factory function with exception handling. No external data input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The mention of AI-powered fallback is in a comment, and no related logic is implemented within this fragment. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple, benign library loader with no malicious behavior or security risks evident within the provided snippet.",
