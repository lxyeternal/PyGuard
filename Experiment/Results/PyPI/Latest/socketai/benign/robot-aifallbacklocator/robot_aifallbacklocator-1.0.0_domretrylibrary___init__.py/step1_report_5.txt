{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Robot Framework library with fallback capabilities for locators using AI (OpenAI), intended to improve test reliability by generating element locators dynamically.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local core module; no external input sources are directly used in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "None apparent in this fragment; no data output or network communication is performed here.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks within this code; the main function creates an instance of DomRetryLibrary and handles exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is straightforward and does not include suspicious or unusual behavior. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. No direct use of external data or network connections is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module and provides a function to instantiate a class, with error handling that writes to standard error. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The mention of AI-powered fallback for locators suggests advanced functionality, but that logic is presumably within the core module, which is not provided here. The code appears standard and secure based on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides a factory function for a Robot Framework library with proper exception handling.",
