  "purpose": "Provides a factory function to instantiate the DomRetryLibrary class with error handling.",
  "sources": "Import of DomRetryLibrary from local module; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Function get_library_instance() creates and returns an instance of DomRetryLibrary, handling exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class, defines metadata, and provides a simple factory function with exception handling. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. Comments mention AI-powered fallback, but no such logic exists here. The code is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. Scores across reports are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, free of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The mention of AI fallback is only in comments and does not impact security. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
