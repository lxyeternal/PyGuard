{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Robot Framework library with AI-powered fallback for locator variables, facilitating automated testing.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the import statement for the DomRetryLibrary class and the internal function call to instantiate it.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the get_library_instance function simply creates an instance of a library class and handles exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code appears straightforward, with standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a core library, defines version and author metadata, and provides a function to instantiate the library with error handling. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious network activity. The only potentially noteworthy aspect is the use of AI-powered fallback in the description, but that is a comment and does not impact execution. The code appears to be a benign component of a testing framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured module for creating an instance of a Robot Framework library. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected based on the provided code. It appears safe and legitimate.",
