  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward Python module that imports a class (`DomRetryLibrary`) and provides a factory function (`get_library_instance`) with basic exception handling.\n   - No evidence of dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network activity.\n   - The code is minimal, primarily for instantiating a class with error handling.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Obfuscation**:\n   - No reports indicate obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or signs of malware.\n   - The code is clear, with no signs of backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.\n   - The mention of AI-powered fallback is in comments or documentation, not in executable code, and does not suggest malicious activity.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities & External Interactions**:\n   - No external inputs are processed; the code does not perform network operations, file I/O, or execute dynamic code.\n   - The only external component is the imported `DomRetryLibrary`, which is assumed to be a legitimate class.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear code.\n   - **Security Risk**: Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, but given the code's simplicity and lack of external data handling, this is likely an overestimate. The minimal risk is due to the potential for the core library or the AI fallback logic (not shown here) to introduce issues.\n\n5. **Summary & Recommendations**:\n   - The code appears safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The mention of AI-powered fallback is purely descriptive; no AI logic is present in this snippet.\n   - The risk scores, especially malware and obfuscated, should remain at 0.\n   - The security risk score could be reduced to 0, considering the lack of any external data processing or network activity.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0 (or very close to zero)\n\nThis code is a benign, standard component of a testing framework with no security concerns based on the provided snippet.",
