{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Robot Framework library for DOM retries with AI-powered fallback for locators, primarily for testing automation.",
  "sources": "Import statement for core.DomRetryLibrary, version, author, email, license metadata, and the get_library_instance() function.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code does not handle untrusted input or perform sensitive operations such as network communication, file I/O, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The function get_library_instance() creates an instance of DomRetryLibrary and returns it; error handling writes to stderr if instantiation fails.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard for a Python library; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a core module to instantiate a library class, provides metadata, and includes basic error handling with stderr output. No external data inputs, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. The get_library_instance() function encapsulates object creation with exception handling but does not process or transmit data. No obfuscation or unusual language features are used.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, legitimate Python library module for Robot Framework, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
