  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'robot_aifallbacklocator' Python project, defining dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; specifies package requirements and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> uses setup() to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It reads the project README for description and specifies dependencies such as robotframework, python-dotenv, and requests. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data manipulation is present. The code follows typical packaging conventions without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. It solely configures package installation parameters.",
