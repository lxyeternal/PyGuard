  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for packaging a project with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, importing setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setup() call with metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and follows typical packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script that reads a README file, specifies dependencies, and calls setup() with package info. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and very low security risk (~0 or 0.1). The code's simplicity and reliance on common packages further confirm its safety. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in all reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
