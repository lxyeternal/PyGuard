  "purpose": "Unit tests for the geometry module's Circle and Triangle classes, verifying area calculations, right-angled detection, and input validation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for Circle and Triangle instances, such as radius and side lengths.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising for invalid inputs; no data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (radius, sides) to validation checks and calculations within the classes; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for unit testing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard unit tests for geometric classes, checking for correct calculations and proper exception handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The reports provided are empty, indicating no identified issues or vulnerabilities. Assuming the classes are implemented correctly, the tests are appropriate and do not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe set of unit tests with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The absence of report details suggests no known issues. Scores should be minimal, reflecting no malware, no obfuscation, and low risk.",
