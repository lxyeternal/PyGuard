  "purpose": "Import classes for geometric shapes (Circle, Triangle, Rectangle) from sibling modules within a package.",
  "sources": "Relative import statements importing classes from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code only performs static imports.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow or external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward relative import statements for shape classes. No logic, data processing, external communication, or malicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and clarity support the conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module import pattern with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
