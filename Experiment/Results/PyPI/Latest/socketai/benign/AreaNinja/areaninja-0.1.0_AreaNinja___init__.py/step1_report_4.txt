{
  "purpose": "The code imports three classes (Circle, Triangle, Rectangle) from local modules, likely for use in geometric calculations or graphical representations.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; imports are static, predefined code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from relative modules, which is typical for organizing code in Python packages. There are no functions, data processing, or external data sources. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. This appears to be standard module import syntax for a geometric shapes package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard import statements for local modules with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
