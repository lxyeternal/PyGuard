{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes related to geometric shapes (Circle, Triangle, Rectangle) from local modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the package",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data paths are evident",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of relative imports of shape classes, which is common in Python packages for modular design. No external input, data processing, or potential vulnerabilities are present. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import statement with no malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate part of a package structure for importing shape classes.",
