{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a package or module that imports geometric shape classes (Circle, Triangle, Rectangle) from sibling modules within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statements retrieving classes from local modules within the package",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present",
  "flows": "Import statements load classes into the current module; no data flow or untrusted input processing observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from relative modules within the package. No runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. The structure is typical for organizing classes in a Python package. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident based on these lines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement set for organizing geometric shape classes; no malicious or security concern signals are identified.",
