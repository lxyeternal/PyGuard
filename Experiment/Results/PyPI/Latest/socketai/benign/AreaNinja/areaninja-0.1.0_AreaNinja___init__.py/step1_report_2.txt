{
  "purpose": "This code imports three classes (Circle, Triangle, Rectangle) from local modules within a package, likely for geometric shape operations or rendering.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code consists solely of relative import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal set of import statements using relative imports to include classes from sibling modules. It does not include any logic, data handling, or external communication. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are observable within these lines. The structure is straightforward and typical for organized Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import block with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It is standard practice in Python package development and does not pose any security risk.",
