{
  "purpose": "This code imports classes for geometric shapes from relative modules, likely for use in a larger application involving shape manipulation or calculations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are observable in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The imports are straightforward relative imports of classes.",
  "analysis": "The code contains three import statements for classes Circle, Triangle, and Rectangle from relative modules. These are standard Python import statements used in modular code design. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or hidden backdoors. The structure and content are typical for Python packages that organize shape classes into separate modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be part of a normal module import process without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.",
