{
  "purpose": "Define a Rectangle class that inherits from a Figure class, providing methods for validation and calculating area.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' for side lengths, assigned during object initialization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not perform any data output, network operations, or file writes.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the class via __init__, then used in _validate and area methods; no untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition with simple validation and calculation methods. It imports 'Figure' from a local module, which is standard. The methods perform basic checks and arithmetic without any dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal class definition for geometric calculation with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
