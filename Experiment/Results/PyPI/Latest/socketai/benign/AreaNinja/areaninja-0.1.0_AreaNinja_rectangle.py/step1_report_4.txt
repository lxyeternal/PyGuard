{
  "purpose": "Define a Rectangle class that inherits from a Figure class, with methods for initialization, validation, and calculating area.",
  "sources": "The class constructor (__init__) and the _validate method, which access input parameters 'a' and 'b'.",
  "sinks": "The 'raise ValueError' in _validate, which could potentially be used to disrupt flow if triggered; however, it is standard validation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' are stored in instance variables and validated before use in 'area' method; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code, or unusual language features are present. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple geometric class with basic validation. It imports from a local module '.geometry', which could be external, but the code itself does not perform any suspicious operations or external communication. The validation method enforces positive side lengths, and the 'area' method calculates a standard geometric property. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of a Rectangle class with proper validation. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks.",
