  "purpose": "Define a Rectangle class inheriting from a Figure base class to compute area after validation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters a and b in __init__, attribute access self.a and self.b, and the _validate method.",
  "sinks": "The raise ValueError in _validate method if sides are non-positive, and the return statement in area().",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to object attributes, then _validate() may be called to check validity, and area() returns the computed value.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Figure class and defines a Rectangle class with attributes for sides a and b. The __init__ method initializes these attributes. The _validate method checks that sides are positive and raises an error if not. The area method computes the rectangle's area. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or unusual control flow. The code appears to be a straightforward geometric calculation class with proper validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard geometric class definition with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs basic validation and computation without any suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
