{
  "purpose": "Define a Rectangle class that inherits from a Figure class, with methods for validation and calculating area.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' during object instantiation, and the imported 'Figure' class.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code does not send data over the network, access sensitive data, or perform destructive actions.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of Rectangle -> calls __init__ -> optional call to _validate -> use of area method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The _validate method is defined but not called within the class, which may indicate incomplete validation but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Figure class and defines a Rectangle subclass with an initializer accepting side lengths. It includes a _validate method that checks for positive side lengths but does not invoke this method automatically, which might be an oversight but is not inherently malicious. The code performs standard object-oriented programming for geometric calculations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward geometric class definition with no malicious intent or security risks. The only minor concern is the unused _validate method, which does not affect security but may indicate incomplete validation logic.",
