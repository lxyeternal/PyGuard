{
  "purpose": "Define a Rectangle class inheriting from a Figure base class, with methods for validation and calculating area.",
  "sources": "Import statement for .geometry.Figure, class attributes self.a and self.b, and the _validate method reading these attributes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "Attributes a and b are set during initialization, used in _validate and area methods; no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code appears straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with basic validation and calculation methods. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious logic. The import statement is typical for modular code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. The code is simple, with clear purpose and no anomalous patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a Rectangle class for geometric calculations. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
