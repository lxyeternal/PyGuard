{
  "purpose": "Define a Rectangle class inheriting from Figure with side validation and area calculation.",
  "sources": "Attributes self.a and self.b set during __init__, _validate method for side validation.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Input sides a and b flow into the object; _validate can raise exception if sides are invalid; area computes based on stored sides.",
  "anomalies": "The _validate() method is defined but not invoked automatically in __init__, which could allow creation of invalid objects if validation is not called explicitly.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious code. The only issue is that _validate() is not called during initialization, which could lead to invalid side lengths but does not constitute a security vulnerability. No suspicious behaviors, external data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The import is from a local module, and methods are standard. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns confirm benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a rectangle class with minor validation oversight. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score of 0.1 appropriately reflects the minor logical flaw without indicating a security threat.",
