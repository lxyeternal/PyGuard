  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for geometric figures with methods for calculating area and input validation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class and method definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely structural code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard abstract class.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple abstract class with two abstract methods, serving as an interface. It contains no executable logic, external calls, or data handling. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and confidence of 1. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard abstract class with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
