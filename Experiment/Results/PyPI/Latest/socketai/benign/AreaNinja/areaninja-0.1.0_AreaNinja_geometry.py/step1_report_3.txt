  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for geometric figures with methods for calculating area and input validation.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs are present; the code is purely class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data passing from sources to sinks occurs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an abstract class with two abstract methods: 'area' and '_validate'. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external calls. The use of ABC and abstractmethod indicates a design pattern rather than executable logic. No potentially malicious or obfuscated code is present; it appears to be a standard interface definition for subclasses. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign abstract class definition intended for extension. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or suspicious code present.",
