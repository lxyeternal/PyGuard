  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class 'Figure' for geometric shapes with methods for calculating area and validation.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing logic involving inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code declares an abstract class 'Figure' using Python's ABC module, with two abstract methods: 'area' and '_validate'. Both methods are placeholders for subclasses to implement specific behavior. No data input, external calls, or dynamic code execution present. The code is standard for defining interfaces in object-oriented design. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward abstract class definition with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It serves as a structural component for other classes.",
