  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class 'Figure' with abstract methods for calculating area and validation.",
  "sources": "Importing 'ABC' and 'abstractmethod' from the 'abc' module; class definition; abstract method definitions",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is being read from external sources or written to untrusted destinations",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines abstract methods without implementation or data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a standard implementation of an abstract class with methods for shape area calculation and validation",
  "analysis": "The code imports the ABC module components, defines an abstract class 'Figure' with two abstract methods 'area' and '_validate'. The methods are placeholders meant for subclass implementation. There is no input/output, no data handling, nor any dynamic or unsafe operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure aligns with standard object-oriented design patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward abstract class definition for geometric figures, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It serves as a base for subclasses to implement specific shapes. No signs of malware or security risks are present.",
