  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for geometric figures with methods for calculating area and input validation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no code execution or data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths; code consists solely of class and method declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code contains standard abstract class definitions with no hidden or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'Figure' with two abstract methods: 'area' and '_validate'. There are no input/output operations, data handling, or external interactions. The code appears to be a straightforward interface definition for geometric shapes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. It does not perform any operations that could be exploited or that indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract class for shapes, with no malicious or security-risk elements. It serves as a blueprint for subclasses to implement specific behaviors. There are no security concerns or malicious activities associated with this code.",
