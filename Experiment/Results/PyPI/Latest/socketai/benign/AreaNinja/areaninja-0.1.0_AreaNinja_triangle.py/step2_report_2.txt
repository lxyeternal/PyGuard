  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and compare them to the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a Triangle class inheriting from Figure.\n- Validates side lengths (positive and triangle inequality).\n- Calculates area using Heron's formula.\n- Checks if the triangle is right-angled via Pythagoras theorem with side sorting.\n- Uses standard math.sqrt from the math module.\n- No external data flows, network operations, or suspicious code patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **Presence of all core functionalities**: validation, area calculation, right-angle check.\n- **No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior**.\n- **No external data sinks or data leakage points**.\n- **Code is straightforward and standard for geometric calculations**.\n\n**Verdict:** The code does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is a typical implementation of a geometric utility class.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n- **Reports 1-6:** All consistently state that the code is standard, straightforward, with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks. They mention the use of Heron's formula, validation, and Pythagoras check, all correct.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - `malware`: 0 in all reports, which is accurate.\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 in all reports, correct.\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 in all reports, justified.\n\n- **Confidence levels:** All high, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Potential issues in reasoning:** None. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation).\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk).\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The code is well-structured, standard, and performs common geometric calculations.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified.\n- No suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | Code is clear, straightforward, and standard.               |\n| Security Risk   | 0            | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious activities.   |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, clean, and performs its intended purpose without security concerns.**",
