  "purpose": "Defines a Triangle class for geometric calculations, including validation, area computation, and right-angle check.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: a, b, c for triangle sides; imported math.sqrt and geometry.Figure",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in potentially dangerous operations or external communications",
  "flows": "Input side lengths -> validation and calculations -> output (area, is_right_angled property)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or code patterns. The code appears straightforward and mathematically focused.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes triangle sides, validates them for positivity and triangle inequality, computes area using Heron's formula, and checks for right angles via Pythagoras. No external data is fetched or sent; no suspicious code patterns or malicious logic detected. The import of sqrt is from math, which is standard. No potential for code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of geometric calculations for a triangle. It appears safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
