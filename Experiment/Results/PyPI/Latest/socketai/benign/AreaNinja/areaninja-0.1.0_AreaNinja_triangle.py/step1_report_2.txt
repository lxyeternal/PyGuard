  "purpose": "Define a Triangle class for geometric calculations, including validation, area calculation, and right-angled check.",
  "sources": "Input parameters a, b, c for triangle sides; the imported sqrt function from math module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input side lengths flow through validation and area calculations; side lengths are used to determine if the triangle is right-angled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious constructs. The code performs standard geometric calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports math.sqrt, defines a Triangle class inheriting from Figure, and validates the triangle sides. It calculates area using Heron's formula and checks if the triangle is right-angled by Pythagoras. There are no external data reads beyond input parameters, no sinks, no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The logic is straightforward, typical for geometric calculations, with proper validation and property usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard geometric utility class with no malicious intent. There are no suspicious behaviors or security risks present. It is safe and does not perform any malicious actions.",
