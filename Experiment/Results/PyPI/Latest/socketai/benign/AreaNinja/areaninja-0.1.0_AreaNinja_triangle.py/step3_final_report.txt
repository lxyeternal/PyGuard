{
  "purpose": "Defines a Triangle class with validation, area calculation, and right-angled check, serving as a geometric utility.",
  "sources": "Input side lengths provided during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; computations are internal.",
  "flows": "Input sides -> validation and calculations (area, right-angle check).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only math.sqrt and a local Figure class, validates sides for positivity and triangle inequality, calculates area using Heron's formula, and checks for right-angled triangles via Pythagoras. No external data or network activity is present. The implementation is clear, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. Validation logic is correct, and the calculations are mathematically sound. No suspicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are detected. The code's purpose is purely geometric, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of a Triangle class with proper validation and calculations. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores are consistent with the analysis.",
