{
  "purpose": "Defines a Triangle class for geometric calculations and validation",
  "sources": "No external input sources; data is passed via constructor parameters a, b, c",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data in a harmful manner; no output or network operations",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters through validation and area calculation methods",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; the code performs standard geometric computations",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sqrt' from math, defines a Triangle class inheriting from a geometry base, with validation for positive side lengths and triangle inequality. It calculates the area using Heron's formula and checks for right-angled triangles. No external data sources, network operations, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears to serve a standard purpose of geometric calculations with proper validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of triangle properties with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It performs standard geometric computations without any suspicious features.",
