  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward implementation of a Triangle class, performing standard geometric calculations with proper validation.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors, external data flows, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The code uses well-known math functions, imports are standard, and the logic is clear and typical for such geometric classes.\n- The reports consistently assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code matches the descriptions; no discrepancies or issues are present.\n- No evidence of code obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports are thorough and do not identify any flaws in logic or implementation.\n- The validation and calculations are standard and correct.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code's clarity.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The confidence levels are mostly 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n- One report has a confidence of 0.95, but given the consistent findings, this is acceptable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe implementation of a Triangle class with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is secure, unobfuscated, and free of malware. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.",
