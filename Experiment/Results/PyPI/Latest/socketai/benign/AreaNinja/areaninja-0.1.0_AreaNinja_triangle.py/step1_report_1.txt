  "purpose": "Define a Triangle class for geometric calculations, including validation and property checks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters a, b, c for side lengths, imported 'sqrt' function, and internal validation methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data leakage or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input side lengths -> validation -> area calculation -> right-angled check; no external data flow or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geometric calculations for a triangle, with input validation to prevent invalid shapes. It uses well-known math functions and standard class properties. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code appears straightforward, with no external network access, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a Triangle class for geometric purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
