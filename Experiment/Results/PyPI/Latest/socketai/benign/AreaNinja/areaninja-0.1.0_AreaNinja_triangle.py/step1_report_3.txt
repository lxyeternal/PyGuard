  "purpose": "Define a Triangle class for geometric calculations, including validation and area computation.",
  "sources": "Input data for triangle sides: a, b, c provided during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; no external data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Input data (a, b, c) flows into validation and area calculation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected. The code performs standard geometric calculations with input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Triangle class with methods to validate sides, compute area, and check for right angles. It imports 'sqrt' from math for calculations, imports a local Figure class, and uses standard Python features. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious code is present. The validation ensures positive side lengths and triangle inequality. The area calculation uses Heron's formula. The right-angled check sorts sides and compares squares. No anomalies such as malicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard geometric utility class with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
