{
  "purpose": "Override and extend functionality of the 'budget.control' model in Odoo to filter certain lines based on a KPI reference.",
  "sources": "Reading the current record ('self') with ensure_one(), calling super() to get lines, and referencing an external record via env.ref.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write to files, make network calls, or handle untrusted input data.",
  "flows": "Input: self (current record), env.ref to get KPI record. Output: filtered lines based on a condition.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; usage of env.ref is standard in Odoo, but it depends on external data which could be manipulated if the reference is misconfigured. No suspicious or unusual code constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code extends an Odoo model, uses ensure_one() for safety, calls the parent method, and filters the result based on a specific KPI record. No unsafe code patterns, no data leaks, no network or file operations. It appears to be a straightforward extension for business logic with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Odoo module extension to filter data; there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this fragment.",
