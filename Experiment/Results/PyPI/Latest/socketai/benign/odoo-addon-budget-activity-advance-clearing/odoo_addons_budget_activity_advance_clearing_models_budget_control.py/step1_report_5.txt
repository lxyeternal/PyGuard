  "purpose": "Override and extend the behavior of the _get_lines_init_date method in an Odoo model to filter certain KPI lines.",
  "sources": "self.env.ref() call to retrieve a specific record reference.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "self.env.ref() retrieves a record, then the filtered lambda applies to existing data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard Odoo model extension.",
  "analysis": "The code extends an Odoo model method to filter lines based on a KPI reference. The env.ref() method retrieves a record with a specific XML ID, which is standard in Odoo. The filtering logic is straightforward, removing lines associated with a specific KPI. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual patterns are present. The code is simple and appears to be a typical extension of existing functionality without any obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension of an Odoo model method to filter data based on a known record. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and intended for legitimate filtering purposes.",
