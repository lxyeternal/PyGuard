{
  "purpose": "Override the _get_lines_init_date method to filter out lines associated with a specific KPI.",
  "sources": "The method self.env.ref to retrieve a reference to a KPI record.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior or leaks.",
  "flows": "The method retrieves a reference, then filters lines based on a condition, without external input or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or unusual code constructs. Uses standard Odoo ORM methods.",
  "analysis": "The code inherits from an existing model and overrides a method. It calls the superclass method to get initial lines, then retrieves a reference record via self.env.ref. It filters the lines to exclude those associated with a specific KPI record. The code appears to perform a legitimate filtering operation without external inputs or malicious logic. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical method override in an Odoo module, intended to filter certain records. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be standard, safe code within its intended context.",
