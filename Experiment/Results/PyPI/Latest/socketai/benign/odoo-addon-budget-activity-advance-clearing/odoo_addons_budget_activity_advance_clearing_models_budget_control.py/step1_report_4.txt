{
  "purpose": "Override a method in an Odoo model to filter specific KPI-related lines in budget control.",
  "sources": "Reads the current record (`self`) and a referenced KPI record (`self.env.ref`).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data outputs or network calls.",
  "flows": "Retrieves and filters data based on a reference KPI, with no external data or untrusted inputs involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, inheriting and overriding a method, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from an Odoo model, overriding a method to filter lines excluding a specific KPI record. Uses standard Odoo ORM methods (`env.ref`, `filtered`). No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. No external network calls or credential handling are involved. The code appears to be standard business logic for filtering data based on references.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign override of a method in an Odoo model with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply filters budget lines based on a KPI reference. No anomalies, malware, or security threats detected.",
