{
  "purpose": "This code extends an Odoo model 'budget.control' by overriding the '_get_lines_init_date' method to filter out lines associated with a specific KPI record identified via 'env.ref'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the KPI record via 'self.env.ref' and the lines via the superclass method.",
  "sinks": "The code filters data in memory; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Source: 'env.ref' retrieves KPI record; flow: filtering lines where 'line.kpi_id != kpi_advance'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. Reliance on 'env.ref' assumes the XML ID exists, but this is standard in Odoo.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly overrides a method, calls the parent, and filters lines based on a KPI reference. It uses standard Odoo ORM practices with no suspicious or malicious constructs. No external inputs, network calls, or secrets are involved. The logic is simple and intended for business filtering. The use of 'env.ref' depends on external data but is common and not inherently insecure. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe extension of an Odoo model, performing legitimate filtering based on a KPI reference. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified and should remain as is.",
