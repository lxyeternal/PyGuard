  "conclusion": "Based solely on the manifest and the absence of detailed report data, there is no indication of malicious intent or security issues. The code is standard, and the reports do not reveal any vulnerabilities or malware. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscated scores are set to 0. The risk score remains low due to incomplete data but without any evidence of problems."
