  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code consists solely of straightforward import statements and a license comment.\n   - No dynamic code execution, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and does not contain any issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a simple module import setup with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks, a high risk score is unjustified.\n   - The current scores of 0 or 0.5 are appropriate.\n   - **Note:** The reports do not specify a `risk` score explicitly, but the `securityRisk` is 0, which is correct.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` as 0.\n   - This is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malware behavior is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on observable facts.\n   - They correctly identify the code as non-malicious.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities present.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign module import file with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed; the assessment aligns well with the code's nature.",
