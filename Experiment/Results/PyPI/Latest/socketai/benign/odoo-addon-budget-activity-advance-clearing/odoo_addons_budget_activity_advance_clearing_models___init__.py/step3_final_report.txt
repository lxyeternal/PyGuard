{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing various components related to budget and expense management within a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the license comment and static import statements from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only performs static imports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply imports modules without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment and static import statements for internal modules. There is no dynamic execution, data processing, or external communication. The code's structure is simple and standard for a modular Python application. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module import setup with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe and straightforward nature. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
