{
  "purpose": "The code is part of a module that imports 'models' from the current package, likely for use in a larger application or framework.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package (__init__.py or similar) and license comment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a license comment; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a license declaration and a single import statement. It appears to be part of a package setup or initialization, with no runtime logic, data processing, or network activity. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The import from '.models' suggests a dependency on a local module, common in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package boilerplate with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It serves as a simple import and licensing notice, with no indications of malicious behavior.",
