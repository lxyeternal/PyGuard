{
  "purpose": "Minimal Python package module initialization with a license comment and an import statement for 'models'.",
  "sources": "The license comment and the import statement (`from . import models`).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leakage or network activity.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and only imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a license comment and a simple import statement, indicating a standard module setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's benign and minimal nature. Confidence levels are high due to the simplicity. No further analysis or action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No adjustments are needed.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
