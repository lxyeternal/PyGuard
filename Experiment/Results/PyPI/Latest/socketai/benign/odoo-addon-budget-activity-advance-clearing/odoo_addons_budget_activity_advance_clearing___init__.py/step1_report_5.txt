{
  "purpose": "The code appears to specify a license for a software project and imports a module named 'models'.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the import statement, which loads the 'models' module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are identifiable due to the minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a license declaration comment and a single import statement. There is no executable logic, data processing, or dynamic behavior. Importing a module does not, by itself, introduce malicious behavior or security risks. The license comment indicates open-source licensing; it does not influence security directly.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal module with a license declaration and an import statement. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code is benign, and no suspicious activity is evident.",
