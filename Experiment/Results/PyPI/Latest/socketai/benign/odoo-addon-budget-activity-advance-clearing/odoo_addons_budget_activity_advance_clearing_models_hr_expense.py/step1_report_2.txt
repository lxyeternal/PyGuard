{
  "purpose": "Extend and customize the behavior of HR expense and expense sheet models in Odoo for handling advance sheets and clearing activities.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from model fields (e.g., self.advance_sheet_id.expense_line_ids, line.clearing_activity_id, self.env.ref). It also reads input from onchange event (self.advance).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks involving untrusted data. No system commands, network connections, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input from user triggers onchange, which sets activity_id based on internal references and model fields. Data flows from user inputs and database lookups to model fields.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. Use of self.env.ref is typical in Odoo modules for referencing records; no obfuscation or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code extends existing models to add new fields and behaviors related to expense clearing activities. It performs standard data filtering, reference lookup, and onchange handling. All operations are within expected Odoo framework practices. No signs of malicious code, such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate customization of Odoo expense models, with no malicious intent or security risks. It follows typical patterns and does not introduce suspicious behavior.",
