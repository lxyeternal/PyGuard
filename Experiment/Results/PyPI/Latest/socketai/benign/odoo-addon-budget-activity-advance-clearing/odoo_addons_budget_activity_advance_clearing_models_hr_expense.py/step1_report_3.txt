{
  "purpose": "Enhance and customize HR expense sheet and expense models within Odoo for handling advance sheets and clearing activities.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from self (model instances), related fields, and environment references like env.ref.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input fields like 'advance', 'clearing_activity_id', and related expense lines to model methods and field updates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of lambda filters and env.ref is standard in Odoo modules.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily modifies and extends existing models with custom logic for expense clearing activities. It uses standard Odoo ORM features such as field definitions, environment references, and onchange methods. No external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The use of super() calls and field filtering appears typical. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward extension of Odoo models for expense management, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It performs intended functionality within the scope of expense handling without any evident security risks.",
