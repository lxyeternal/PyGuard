{
  "purpose": "Extend 'budget.activity' to update the expense account of a related product when the account_id changes, based on specific reference records.",
  "sources": "Reads self.account_id, self._origin.id, and references via env.ref to specific XML IDs.",
  "sinks": "Calls update() on a product record to modify 'property_account_expense_id'.",
  "flows": "On change of account_id, if the current record matches a specific budget activity reference, update the product property.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, external network calls, obfuscation, or hardcoded credentials observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Odoo model extension that reacts to onchange events. It retrieves specific records via env.ref() using static XML IDs, then conditionally updates a related product record's expense account. The logic is standard for Odoo customizations, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external dependencies. The use of self._origin.id ensures the record is correctly identified during onchange. The code operates within expected patterns, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Odoo customization with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores of zero malware and obfuscation, with very low security risk, are appropriate and accurate.",
