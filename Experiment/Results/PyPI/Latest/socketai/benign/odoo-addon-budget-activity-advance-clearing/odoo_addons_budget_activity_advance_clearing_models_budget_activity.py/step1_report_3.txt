  "purpose": "Override the onchange method to update expense account based on the budget activity record",
  "sources": "Reads 'self.env.ref' for specific record references and 'self._origin.id' to check current record origin",
  "sinks": "Calls 'update' method on a record to modify 'property_account_expense_id'",
  "flows": "Reads reference records, checks condition, then updates a record property",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, straightforward reference and update pattern",
  "analysis": "The code extends a model to modify account properties when a certain activity is selected. It retrieves specific records using 'env.ref', checks if the current record matches a particular reference, then updates another record's property accordingly. No untrusted input processing, no dynamic code execution, and no external network activity are present. The logic appears standard for Odoo module customization, with proper use of API and reference handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a typical data update operation within an Odoo module, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely references records and updates properties without exposing sensitive data or executing malicious actions.",
