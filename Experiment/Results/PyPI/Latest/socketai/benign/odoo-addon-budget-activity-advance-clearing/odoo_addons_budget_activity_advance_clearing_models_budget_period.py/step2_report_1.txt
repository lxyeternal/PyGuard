  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward Odoo model extension, overriding `_get_budget_avaiable` to filter out lines linked to a specific KPI (`budget_kpi_advance`) before calling the parent method.\n- The logic is transparent, uses standard Odoo ORM patterns (`env.ref`, `filtered`), and includes clear comments.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or malicious code patterns are evident.\n- The filtering is based solely on business logic, not security-sensitive operations.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly identifies the code's intent and how it reads the KPI reference.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is a standard extension with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.  \n  The low security risk score seems reasonable, given the code's nature.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning is sound, and the score aligns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly describes the filtering process.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Accurately states that the code is typical for Odoo customizations, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n  The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities are introduced.\n- **Verdict:** Well reasoned and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Similar understanding.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard filtering extension.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.  \n  Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) might be due to referencing external records, but no actual risk exists.  \n  This seems marginally high but still acceptable given the context.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Properly states the code is a typical extension with no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.  \n  These are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- **Verdict:** Sound reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly summarizes.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriately notes that the code performs controlled filtering without malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.  \n  The low security risk is justified; no vulnerabilities are introduced.\n- **Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, with scores at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are reasonable, given the code's context as a business logic extension, not a security risk.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, related to external references, but not risky.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and appropriately scored. The code is a standard, transparent extension with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed. The analysis and scoring are appropriate.",
