{
  "purpose": "This code extends the 'budget.period' model in Odoo to customize the behavior of budget availability calculations, specifically excluding certain KPI-related lines from budget checks.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment reference 'self.env.ref' to retrieve a specific KPI record and inspects 'template_lines' to filter based on 'kpi_id'.",
  "sinks": "The code calls a superclass method '_get_budget_avaiable', passing potentially filtered 'template_lines'.",
  "flows": "The code reads KPI reference data, filters 'template_lines' based on KPI, then proceeds to invoke the parent method with the filtered data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code logic appears straightforward, focused on filtering and inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Odoo model extension, with standard use of environment references, filtering, and method overriding. It filters out lines associated with a specific KPI before calling the parent method. No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The logic is transparent and aligns with typical Odoo development practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard model extension for custom business logic in Odoo. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code simply filters specific lines based on a KPI reference and delegates further processing to the superclass.",
