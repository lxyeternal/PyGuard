  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent extension implementing business logic to exclude certain budget lines based on KPI. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score is justified by its internal, business-specific filtering, and the malware score remains zero. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
