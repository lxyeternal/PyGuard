{
  "purpose": "This code extends the 'budget.period' model in Odoo to modify the behavior of budget availability calculations, specifically filtering out certain KPI-related lines.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data via 'self.env.ref' and input data via 'template_lines' parameter, including its filtered result.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity. It calls a superclass method for further processing.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'template_lines' (filtered) flows into the superclass method '_get_budget_avaiable', which handles further calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; the code performs standard filtering and inheritance without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code extends an Odoo model to filter out KPI-related lines in budget templates before calculating budget availability. It uses a reference to an external record 'budget_kpi_advance' and performs filtering based on this reference. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The purpose appears to be standard business logic extension.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate extension of the Odoo budgeting module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs data filtering and inheritance without dangerous operations.",
