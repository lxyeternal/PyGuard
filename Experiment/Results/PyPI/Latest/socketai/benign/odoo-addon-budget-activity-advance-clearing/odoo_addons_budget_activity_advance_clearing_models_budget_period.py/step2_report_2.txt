  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core logic: filtering out budget template lines associated with a specific KPI ('budget_kpi_advance') before calling the superclass method.\n- The code uses standard Odoo practices: env.ref for record references, filtered for recordset filtering, and method overriding with super().\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external network activity are noted.\n- The purpose appears to be legitimate business logic for budget management, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code's logic matches the reports' descriptions.\n- The filtering based on KPI reference is straightforward and transparent.\n- No issues are present in the code that would suggest malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the code or the reports' reasoning.\n- The logic is consistent, and the use of environment references and filtering is correct.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0. The code performs standard filtering; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which seems reasonable given the code's nature. The code's operations are internal and do not introduce external attack vectors.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The risk scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- The malware score should remain 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score should remain 0.\n- The security risk score can stay as is, reflecting minimal but non-zero concern due to reliance on external references, which is standard in modular systems.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** (appropriate for business logic extension with external references)\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, legitimate, and well-structured.** No supply chain or security issues are evident from this review.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard Odoo model extension implementing filtering logic based on KPI references.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain unchanged.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep all scores as they are; the code poses no security concern.",
