  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines simple math tools and placeholders; sources are benign strings and parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or sensitive data flows; functions return straightforward results.\n- **Anomalies:** Commented-out code for image processing and resources, but inactive.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no external data access, no obfuscation, and no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, straightforward, and secure.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the framework setup and simple functions.\n- No active malicious code, just placeholders.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Defines tools and resources, including potential for image processing and code review prompts.\n- No active external data handling or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar structure, with placeholders and simple functions.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Focuses on simple math functions with commented placeholders.\n- No active malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe benign, straightforward code implementing simple functions and placeholders.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only minor concern is the presence of commented-out code that could be activated in the future, but as-is, it poses no risk.\n- **Scores Justification:** The assigned scores seem appropriate given the benign nature. No active malicious behavior warrants a malware score above 0. The security risk remains low, given the lack of external data handling or network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should stay at 0, since no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Could be slightly lowered to 0 in some reports, but 0.2 is acceptable considering the placeholders and potential future extensions.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or very close to it, e.g., 0.1) due to the presence of commented-out code that could be misused if activated.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code appears safe, with no active malicious elements or obfuscation. The current scores are reasonable, but I would recommend setting the malware and obfuscated scores to 0, and the overall security risk to near zero, given the evidence.",
