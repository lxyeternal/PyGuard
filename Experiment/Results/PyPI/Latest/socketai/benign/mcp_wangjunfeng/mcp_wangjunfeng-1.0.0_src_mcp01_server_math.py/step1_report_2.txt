{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of tools and resource functions for a FastMCP (Multi-Chain Processing) framework, primarily for mathematical operations and potentially for code review or debugging support.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as 'a', 'b', 'code', and 'error'. It also includes commented-out resource functions that could read configuration data, user profile data, or images if uncommented.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations, external systems, or insecure functions in the active code. The commented-out code could potentially involve file operations or image processing if enabled, but as-is, they are inactive.",
  "flows": "The input data (parameters) flows into simple mathematical operations. No external or untrusted data sources are actively used. Commented functions suggest potential data flows, but they are not active.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The commented code suggests additional functionality that might be sensitive if enabled, but they are currently inactive.",
  "analysis": "The active code imports a class from an external library 'mcp.server.fastmcp', sets up a FastMCP instance, and defines two basic mathematical functions decorated as tools. These functions perform straightforward addition and multiplication without any input validation, external data access, or security-sensitive operations. Commented-out sections suggest additional resource and prompt functions, but these are inactive and do not pose security concerns in their current state. Overall, the code appears to be a standard setup for a tool framework with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for a FastMCP framework, defining simple mathematical tools. There are no active malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The commented sections, if enabled, could introduce additional functionality but do not currently pose risks.",
