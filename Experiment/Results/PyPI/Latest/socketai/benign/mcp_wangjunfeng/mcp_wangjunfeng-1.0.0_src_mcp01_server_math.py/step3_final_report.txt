{
  "purpose": "Defines simple mathematical tools and placeholders for a modular framework, including functions for addition and multiplication.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'a', 'b', and string literals within functions; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "Return statements of functions; no external data leaks or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions and their results are returned directly; no external or untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code for image processing, resource retrieval, and prompts; inactive and not executed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward, benign functions with no external data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The commented sections are inactive placeholders. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, though the risk could be lowered further given the inactivity of placeholders.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign scaffold for a modular framework, containing only simple arithmetic functions and inactive placeholders. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, but the overall security risk score can be set to 0 for a more accurate reflection of the code's safety.",
