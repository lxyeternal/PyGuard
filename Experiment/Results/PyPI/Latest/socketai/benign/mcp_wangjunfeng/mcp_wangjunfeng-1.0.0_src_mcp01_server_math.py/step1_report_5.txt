{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of tools and resource functions for a FastMCP instance, primarily for mathematical operations and placeholders for additional resources and prompts.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'code', 'error', 'user_id', 'image_path') and potentially from commented resource functions (e.g., 'get_config', 'get_user_profile').",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could be used if external inputs are incorporated into sensitive operations, but no explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data leaks are present in active code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters to return values; no complex data flows or external communications are established. Commented code suggests possible resource access but is inactive.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. Commented sections indicate placeholders for resource handling or image processing but contain no active malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The active code solely provides mathematical functions 'add' and 'multiply' with straightforward implementations. The rest of the code consists of commented-out sections that define resource functions for configuration, user profiles, and prompts. There are no network operations, no code execution, no use of environment variables, nor any suspicious behaviors. The commented code could be placeholders or examples, but they are inactive. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected in the current active code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign setup of tools and resource functions for a FastMCP framework, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The inactive sections do not introduce any threat in their current state.",
