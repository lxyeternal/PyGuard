{
  "purpose": "The code defines a module with several tools and resource functions for use with the mcp framework, primarily providing simple mathematical operations and placeholders for additional functionalities such as image processing and user data retrieval.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings (e.g., 'Math' for FastMCP initialization), function parameters (a, b, user_id, code, error), and potentially image file paths in commented sections.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include return statements that output data, especially in commented functions that could process and return image data or user info, and the print/logging could be in the mcp framework, but not explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "The flow involves input parameters to functions (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'user_id', 'code', 'error') being processed within functions, with some functions returning data directly. There are no external data flows or network operations visible.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code for image processing and configuration resources, but no active code performs file I/O, network operations, or handling untrusted input in a suspicious manner. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The active code primarily implements simple mathematical functions with no input validation or external data handling. The commented sections suggest potential future extensions but are inactive. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The framework appears to be a scaffold for a larger application. No security risks are evident from the visible code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and lacks any malicious or suspicious behavior. It functions as a simple toolset within the mcp framework, with no active malicious payloads or security risks present.",
