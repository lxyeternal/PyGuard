  "conclusion": "The code is a benign scaffold for a modular framework, containing only simple arithmetic functions and inactive placeholders. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, but the overall security risk score can be set to 0 for a more accurate reflection of the code's safety."
