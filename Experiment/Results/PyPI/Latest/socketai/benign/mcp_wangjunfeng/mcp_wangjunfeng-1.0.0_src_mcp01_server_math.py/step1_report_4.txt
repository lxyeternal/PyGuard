{
  "purpose": "Define a set of tools and resource functions for a system called FastMCP, including mathematical operations and potential placeholders for image processing, configuration, user data, and chat interactions.",
  "sources": "Code reads hardcoded string inputs and function parameters, such as 'code', 'error', 'user_id', and string literals within functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted external data or perform sensitive operations like network access, file writing, or system modification.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and function arguments to return statements and message outputs, with no evidence of external or untrusted data being transmitted or processed insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out functions suggest placeholders for image processing, configuration, user data, and chat prompts, but these are inactive and do not pose risk. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a class 'FastMCP' with several decorated functions that perform basic operations such as addition and multiplication. The commented sections hint at potential expansion for image processing and resource management, but they are inactive. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The current implementation appears to be straightforward and secure, assuming the external 'FastMCP' library functions as intended.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks based on the current content. It appears to be a benign setup of utility functions with placeholders for future features. No evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities was detected.",
