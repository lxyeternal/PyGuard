{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of tools and resources using the mcp.server.fastmcp library for various operations, including simple arithmetic functions and placeholders for additional functionalities like image processing, configuration retrieval, and code review prompts.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from function parameters (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'code', 'error', 'user_id') and potentially from external resources if uncommented (e.g., image files, configuration data).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted input (like 'code' in review_code) is returned or processed without validation, but currently, the code only formats strings or returns parameters. No evident sink that leads to system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into return statements or string formatting; no dangerous flows to system calls or network operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code involving image processing and resource retrieval suggests placeholders for more complex functions but currently inactive. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up functions with the mcp library, including simple arithmetic and placeholders for additional features. All functions are benign, with no direct or indirect malicious behaviors. The commented-out sections hint at potential future functionalities but do not contribute to current security concerns. No suspicious data handling, external connections, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard, benign setup for a modular system using the mcp library. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on current implementation. The code is well-structured and free from anomalies or suspicious activity.",
