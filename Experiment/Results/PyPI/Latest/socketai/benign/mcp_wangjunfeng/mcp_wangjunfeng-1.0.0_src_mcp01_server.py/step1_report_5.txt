{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class 'FastMCP' from a module within the 'mcp.server' package and instantiates it with the argument 'MCP Server'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'FastMCP' from 'mcp.server.fastmcp', and the instantiation of 'FastMCP' with a string argument.",
  "sinks": "The instantiation of 'FastMCP' may be a sink if 'FastMCP' executes untrusted input or performs sensitive operations upon creation.",
  "flows": "Import 'FastMCP' -> instantiate 'FastMCP' with a string argument 'MCP Server'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no external data input or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple import statement and an instantiation of a class with a static string parameter. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no user input processing are visible. The 'FastMCP' class is imported from a local package path, but without additional context or source code for 'FastMCP', there are no signs of malicious behavior. The use of a straightforward class instantiation with a static string does not inherently suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, performing a standard import and object creation. There are no indications of malicious activity or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
