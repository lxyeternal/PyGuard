{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize an instance of the FastMCP class, likely for interacting with or managing an MCP server.",
  "sources": "The code imports the FastMCP class from the mcp.server.fastmcp module and creates an instance with a string argument.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is being read from untrusted sources or written to external systems in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing the class, then instantiating it with a fixed string argument; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward and uses a common pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and creates an object instance with a static string. There is no evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity. The import path suggests a package structure related to MCP servers, but nothing malicious is indicated. The code is minimal and appears to be part of a larger program.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is benign, performing standard import and object instantiation without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
