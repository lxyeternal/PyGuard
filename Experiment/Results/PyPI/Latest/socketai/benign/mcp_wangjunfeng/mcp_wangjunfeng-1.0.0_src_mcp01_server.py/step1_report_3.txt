{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class 'FastMCP' from a module 'mcp.server.fastmcp' and instantiates an object with the argument 'MCP Server'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'mcp.server.fastmcp'. The instantiation of 'FastMCP' with a string argument.",
  "sinks": "The instantiation of 'FastMCP' with a string parameter; potential for misuse if 'FastMCP' processes or exposes this data insecurely.",
  "flows": "Import source -> object instantiation with string argument.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a class from a package and creating an instance with a string argument. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. Without additional context about 'FastMCP' or what it does with the argument, this appears to be standard initialization code. No external data inputs or outputs are present. The code does not perform any network operations or data manipulation beyond class instantiation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and standard, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this snippet. It simply imports and initializes a class with a parameter.",
