  "purpose": "Importing the FastMCP class from the mcp.server.fastmcp module and creating an instance with a descriptive string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from mcp.server.fastmcp, instantiation with string \"MCP Server\"",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects are present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "Import of class -> instantiation with static string; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and instantiation, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal: it imports a class and creates an object with a static string. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are evident. The class's internal behavior cannot be assessed, but based solely on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard import and object creation with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
