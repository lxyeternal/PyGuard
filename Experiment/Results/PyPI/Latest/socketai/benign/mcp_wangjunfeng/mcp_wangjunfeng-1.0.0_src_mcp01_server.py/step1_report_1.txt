  "purpose": "Import the FastMCP class from the mcp.server.fastmcp module and instantiate it with a string parameter.",
  "sources": "Import statement from mcp.server.fastmcp module, instantiation of FastMCP with a string argument",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of FastMCP object; potential use of the object depends on further code not provided",
  "flows": "Import module -> instantiate FastMCP with 'MCP Server' string",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected in the provided snippet",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a module and creates an instance with a string parameter. Without further context, this appears to be a straightforward setup or initialization process. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present in the snippet. The import and instantiation are typical patterns in Python applications, and no indications of malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing a simple import and object instantiation without any malicious behavior or security risks visible in this fragment.",
