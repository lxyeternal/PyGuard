  "purpose": "Instantiate an object of the FastMCP class from the mcp.server.fastmcp module, likely to set up or interact with an MCP server.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'FastMCP' from 'mcp.server.fastmcp'.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of 'FastMCP' object with a string argument, potentially used internally for server setup or communication.",
  "flows": "Import of class -> creation of object with a string argument.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and object creation with a static string.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a module and creates an instance with a string parameter. There are no evident signs of malicious code such as dynamic execution, network connections, or secret data. The class name suggests it might handle server functionality, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign code snippet that imports a class and creates an instance with a descriptive string argument. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this code.",
