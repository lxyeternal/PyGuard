  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the original code snippet:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\nfrom mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\n\nmcp = FastMCP(\"MCP Server\")\n```\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Import `FastMCP` and instantiate with `\"MCP Server\"`.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. It's a straightforward setup.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is benign. The malware score of 0 is appropriate, and the security risk is minimal. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; initializes `FastMCP` with a string.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies, straightforward pattern.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code appears benign. No modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Import and instantiate `FastMCP` with `\"MCP Server\"`.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity or obfuscation; standard initialization.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Import and instantiate `FastMCP` with `\"MCP Server\"`.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; straightforward.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; simple import and instantiation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious indicators; standard pattern.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct given the code's simplicity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above 0.1, but given the simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and appropriate.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks is present.\n- The code snippet is a standard import and object instantiation pattern.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.",
