  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, potential system/network/file operations, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "System commands, network communications, file writes, data leaks, environment variables.",
  "flows": "From sources (inputs, env vars) to sinks (system/network/file), potentially via eval/exec or dynamic features.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code features flagged but not confirmed malicious.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no concrete evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. They identify dynamic features like eval() but lack evidence of misuse. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious patterns. Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting cautious awareness of potential dynamic code execution risks. Confidence levels are moderate to high, based on thorough review but limited by lack of actual code snippets. No significant anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The assessments are internally consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and malware remains at zero. Vigilance should be maintained if code evolves to include eval/exec or obfuscation, but current evidence supports a safe status.",
