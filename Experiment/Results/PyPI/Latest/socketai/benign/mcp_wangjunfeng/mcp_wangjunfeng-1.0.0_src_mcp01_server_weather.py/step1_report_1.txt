{
  "purpose": "Define a set of tools, resources, and prompts for a weather-related application using the mcp framework.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; function parameters such as 'location' and 'user_id' could be user input but are not processed directly here.",
  "sinks": "Return statements in functions returning static or dynamic data; no unsafe data handling or external data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "User input parameters ('location', 'user_id', 'error') flow into functions but are used only in controlled string formatting or static returns; no direct flow to external systems or insecure handling.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes standard framework setup with resource and prompt decorators, no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a framework for handling weather info, configuration, user profiles, and prompts for review/debugging. No user input is directly processed in a malicious manner. The functions return static or formatted data without executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data insecurely. No external calls, network activities, or potentially malicious operations are present. The overall structure appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard setup for a toolset using the mcp framework, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It primarily provides static responses and prompt definitions without dangerous behaviors.",
