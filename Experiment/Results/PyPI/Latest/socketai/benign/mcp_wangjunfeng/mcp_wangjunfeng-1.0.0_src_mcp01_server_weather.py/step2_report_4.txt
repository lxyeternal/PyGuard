  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n- The code consists of straightforward resource and prompt definitions, returning static or formatted data.\n- No external network calls, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code are evident.\n- The parameters such as 'location', 'user_id', 'code', 'error' are used only in string formatting or message creation, not in dangerous operations.\n- The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippets are consistent with their described purpose. No issues are detected in the code structure or logic.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports find signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree that the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** The overall risk scores are low (~0.1), aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justifications:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (~0.1), indicating minimal but non-zero residual risk—probably due to the presence of user inputs, which are handled safely here.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- Since no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The overall assessment should remain that the code is safe and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Systematic Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent to handling user input, but no actual risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are thorough and accurate. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and should be maintained.\n\n**My final assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the evidence presented.",
