{
  "purpose": "Define a set of tools, resources, and prompts for a FastMCP instance related to weather information and code review functionalities.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from function parameters (e.g., location, user_id, code, error). It also imports modules and classes from external packages.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly send data to external networks, write to files, or perform potentially malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data (location, user_id, code, error) flows into functions and returns static or dynamic responses, with no external data leaks or harmful operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The functions return static or formatted data. No obfuscation or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of decorated functions that serve as tools, resources, and prompts for a FastMCP instance. All functions return static or formatted strings without performing any external or unsafe operations. The use of async in get_weather suggests non-blocking I/O but no actual network calls are implemented here. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The overall structure is straightforward and intended for a controlled environment. No suspicious or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign configuration script setting up a framework for weather information retrieval, configuration access, user profile management, and code review prompts. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks in this implementation.",
