  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, mainly defining resource endpoints, prompts, and static or formatted responses.\n- No external network calls, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code are present.\n- The functions do not process untrusted input in a malicious way; parameters are used for string formatting only.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard setup for a framework, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. The report's conclusion that the code is benign and safe is accurate.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the report's reasoning.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, correct.\n  - Security risk: 0.1 or 0, depending on the report. Given the benign code, a score of 0 or very close to 0 is justified.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as safe.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5:** None of the reports assign a high risk score. The highest is 0.1, which is reasonable.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, justified by the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Flow analysis:** Correctly notes that data flows are limited to string formatting and static responses, with no external or unsafe data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- The reports are consistent and thorough. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The reasoning is sound, and no assumptions about vulnerabilities are unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on all the reports and my own review, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks present)\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, safe setup for a framework, primarily serving static responses and prompt definitions, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary. The code is benign, with scores reflecting its safe nature.",
