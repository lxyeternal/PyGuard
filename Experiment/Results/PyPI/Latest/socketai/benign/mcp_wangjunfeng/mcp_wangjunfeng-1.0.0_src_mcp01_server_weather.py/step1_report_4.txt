{
  "purpose": "This code defines a server with various resource endpoints and prompts for interaction, primarily related to weather information, configuration data, and user profiles.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from function return values and user input (e.g., 'location' and 'user_id' parameters).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data in a way that leads to data leakage or system compromise; no network calls, file writes, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like 'location' and 'user_id' are used within return statements, but are not passed to untrusted sinks or external systems. No complex data flows or external data manipulations are evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The functions are simple and do not perform suspicious operations. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines resource and prompt functions for a server framework (FastMCP). All functions return static or formatted data with no external calls, data processing beyond string formatting, or security-sensitive operations. The use of async and decorators aligns with standard patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of providing mock responses and prompts for an API.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, implementing simple resource endpoints and prompts without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.",
