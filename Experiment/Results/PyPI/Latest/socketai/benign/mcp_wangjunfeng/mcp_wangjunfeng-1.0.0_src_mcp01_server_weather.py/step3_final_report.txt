{
  "purpose": "Define tools, resources, and prompts for weather, configuration, user profiles, and debugging within a framework.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as 'location', 'user_id', 'code', 'error' used in string formatting and message creation.",
  "sinks": "None; data is used only locally in string responses and message objects, with no external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into string formatting functions, generating static or formatted responses without external effects.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in static weather response ('New Work' instead of 'New York'), but no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a framework setup with resource endpoints and prompts, returning static or formatted strings. No external calls, data leaks, or code execution of untrusted input. No obfuscation or secrets are present. The functions are straightforward, and parameters are used safely. The overall structure indicates benign, configuration-like code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, safe, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified given its static nature and lack of external interactions. All signals point to a safe implementation with no vulnerabilities.",
