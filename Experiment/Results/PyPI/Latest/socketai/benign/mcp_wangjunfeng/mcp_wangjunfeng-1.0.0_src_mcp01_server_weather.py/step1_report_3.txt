{
  "purpose": "This code defines a FastMCP-based framework with various tools, resources, and prompts for a weather-related application and code review/debugging functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the 'code' parameter in review_code, 'error' parameter in debug_error, and possibly external data from user interactions or API calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the return statements that output data; especially the review_code function which returns a string potentially based on input code, but no direct unsafe operations or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input (code, error messages) into the prompt functions, then outputs strings or message lists. There are no complex source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data leading to dangerous actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. All functions perform straightforward data returns or message constructions.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a framework with functions for weather info, configuration, user profiles, and prompts for code review and debugging. The review_code function simply formats the input code into a prompt; no processing of untrusted code occurs that could execute maliciously. The debug_error function creates message objects for debugging purposes. There are no signs of malicious behaviors, such as network calls to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The overall structure is typical for a modular API, and the code appears clean and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign framework setup with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It primarily facilitates structured prompts and resource definitions without executing or mishandling sensitive data.",
