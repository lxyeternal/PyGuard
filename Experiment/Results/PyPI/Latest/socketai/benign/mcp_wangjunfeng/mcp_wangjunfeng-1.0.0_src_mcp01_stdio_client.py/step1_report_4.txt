{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize and run an AI agent that interacts with an external server process, using environmental variables and external tools for processing.",
  "sources": "load_dotenv() loads environment variables; await load_mcp_tools(session) loads tools possibly from external sources; agent invocation with user input.",
  "sinks": "Printing tools and responses; potential for sensitive data exposure if tools or responses contain secrets.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> load_mcp_tools -> create_react_agent -> agent.ainvoke -> print response",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns detected. External process invocation is via a standard subprocess call with specified args, not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables, initializes an AI model and server parameters, sets up communication with an external process using asyncio and custom client sessions. It loads tools dynamically, creates an agent, and invokes a response based on user input. All external interactions seem standard; no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The only notable activity is the invocation of an external Python script ('./server_math.py') which is a typical design choice and not suspicious in itself. No hardcoded secrets or insecure practices are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard asynchronous AI agent framework, interfacing with external tools and processes. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code snippet.",
