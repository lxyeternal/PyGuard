{
  "purpose": "Set up an asynchronous AI agent environment that loads tools, invokes an external server script, and processes a math query.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via dotenv; external script './server_math.py' invoked as a subprocess; user message input passed to the agent.",
  "sinks": "External script './server_math.py' execution; agent invocation with user message; environment variables.",
  "flows": "load_dotenv() -> external script invocation -> agent processing user message -> output response",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets; reliance on external script without validation; no input sanitization shown.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables, sets up an external process ('./server_math.py') via subprocess, establishes async communication, loads tools, creates an AI agent, and invokes it with a math query. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The main risk stems from the external script and environment variables, which could be malicious if compromised. The code itself appears benign, with scores reflecting no malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and a moderate security risk (~0.2-0.3) due to external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for an AI agent with external tool integration. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident within this snippet. External dependencies, especially 'server_math.py', could pose risks if malicious, but within this code, no malicious activity is detected. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, and risk is approximately 0.2-0.3.",
