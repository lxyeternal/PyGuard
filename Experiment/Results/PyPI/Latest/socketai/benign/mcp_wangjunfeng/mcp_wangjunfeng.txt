There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, but the overall security risk score can be set to 0 for a more accurate reflection of the code's safety."

External dependencies, especially 'server_math.py', could pose risks if malicious, but within this code, no malicious activity is detected. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, and risk is approximately 0.2-0.3."

Vigilance should be maintained if code evolves to include eval/exec or obfuscation, but current evidence supports a safe status."
