  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, user inputs, or external libraries that may load data; however, no explicit input sources are visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network calls, file writes, or system commands, but no such actions are evident in the code provided.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows visible in the snippet; the code mainly contains function definitions and control structures without external data interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code structure appears typical, with no obfuscated elements or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of standard Python functions, control flow, and library calls. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or unauthorized system access, is evident. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets or malicious anomalies. The absence of external network or system calls reduces suspicion. Given the limited snippet, no malicious intent can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and does not contain malware or suspicious anomalies.",
