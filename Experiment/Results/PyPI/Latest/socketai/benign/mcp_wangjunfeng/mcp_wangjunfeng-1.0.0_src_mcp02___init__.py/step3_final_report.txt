  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network connections, file operations, input functions, external libraries, control structures, and data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, files, system commands, environment variables, or other output points where untrusted data could cause leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input sources (e.g., environment, network, user input) flowing into processing functions, then to sinks such as network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code constructs detected. No anomalies beyond limited context or missing code.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of suspicious or malicious code, with scores for malware and obfuscation set to zero. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited or absent code snippets. Risk scores are low (around 0.2), reflecting cautious assessment due to limited context but no evidence of threat. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious activities are identified. The evaluations are consistent and reasonable, with no contradictions or overlooked signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks based on the provided information. The scoring and confidence levels are appropriate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary at this time.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
