  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific function or task, but without the actual code provided, it's unclear what that is.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions, reading from files, environment variables, or network connections, but no specific code is provided to identify these.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network transmissions, file writes, or database queries. No specific sinks are identifiable without the code.",
  "flows": "Flow analysis cannot be performed without concrete code, but generally involves tracing data from sources to sinks to detect malicious pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified due to the absence of actual code content. Cannot determine if there are hardcoded secrets, obfuscated segments, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "No code provided to analyze step-by-step. Cannot identify data flows, suspicious behavior, or security issues without specific code snippets.",
