  "purpose": "Set up an AI agent with external tools for mathematical calculations and weather queries, executing local scripts and connecting to local services.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via load_dotenv(); local script './server_math.py'; local SSE endpoint 'http://localhost:8000/sse'.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of external script './server_math.py' and connection to local SSE endpoint; no untrusted data handling or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables loaded -> model initialized -> connections configured -> MultiServerMCPClient established -> create_react_agent created -> messages sent to agent -> responses received and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup. External script invocation ('./server_math.py') could be a concern if compromised, but no malicious code detected within this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables, sets up a model, configures local and internal connections, and invokes an agent asynchronously. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. External dependencies ('server_math.py' and local SSE endpoint) are typical in development but could pose supply chain risks if compromised. The code itself does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The external script invocation is a potential vector but outside the scope of this code review. Overall, the code appears benign, with low security risk primarily related to external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured setup for an AI agent interacting with local tools and services. No malicious or obfuscated elements are detected. The main supply chain concern is external scripts, but within this code, no malicious activity is evident. The security risk score remains low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero.",
