{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a multi-server client and interacts with a language model and external tools to process mathematical and weather queries.",
  "sources": "load_dotenv() loads environment variables; import statements; connection configuration for 'math' and 'weather' tools.",
  "sinks": "Awaited invoke calls on the agent, which could potentially execute code or fetch external data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Client initialization -> Agent invocation with messages -> External tool communication (local script and HTTP SSE endpoint).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. Use of environment variables is standard. External connections are to localhost and a known SSE endpoint, which is typical for local integrations.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables, sets up connections to local services (a Python script and a local HTTP SSE server), and interacts asynchronously with a language model agent. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or system manipulation are detected. External connections are limited to localhost and are used for local tools or services, which is common in development or controlled environments. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code appears to be a legitimate integration of AI components with local tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for integrating an AI model with local tools and external services. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are observed. It appears safe within the context provided.",
