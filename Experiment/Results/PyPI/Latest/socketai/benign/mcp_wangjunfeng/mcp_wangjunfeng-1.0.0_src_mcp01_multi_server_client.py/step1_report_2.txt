{
  "purpose": "The code initializes environment variables, sets up connections to external services, and creates an agent to process user queries related to math and weather information.",
  "sources": "load_dotenv() reads environment variables; the 'connections' dictionary reads configuration data for server connections; 'async with MultiServerMCPClient' reads connection parameters; 'agent.ainvoke()' reads user message inputs.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statements output responses, but do not directly process untrusted data in a security-sensitive way. No file writes, network transmissions, or external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables loaded → connection configurations read → connections established → user queries processed via 'ainvoke' → responses printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code straightforwardly creates an agent to handle questions about math and weather. No malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables, defines server connection details, and creates an asynchronous client to connect to multiple services. It constructs an agent using 'create_react_agent' with a specified model, then invokes two queries asynchronously. The flow appears typical for a chat agent setup, with no signs of malicious data handling or suspicious activity. The usage of external modules and environment variables seems standard and non-malicious. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network calls, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for an AI-powered agent handling math and weather queries, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe based on the provided code fragment.",
