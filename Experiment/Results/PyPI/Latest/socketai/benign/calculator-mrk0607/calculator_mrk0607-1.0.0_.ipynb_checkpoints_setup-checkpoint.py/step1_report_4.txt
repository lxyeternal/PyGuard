{
  "purpose": "To define and configure the setup parameters for a Python package named 'calculator-mrk0607'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'Readme.txt' and 'changelog.txt' files for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or untrusted data flows; no data leaks or security-sensitive operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Source: File reads of documentation files -> no data flow to sinks that affect runtime security.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() for reading files directly in setup(); potential risk if files are missing or manipulated, but this is standard practice and not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script configuring package metadata with no reliance on external inputs during execution. It reads static documentation files for long description, which is standard. No code injection, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated code are present. All dependencies are empty, indicating no external malicious dependencies. No network calls or system modifications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup configuration script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate, serving the purpose of packaging a basic calculator module.",
