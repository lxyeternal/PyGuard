  "purpose": "Setup script for a basic calculator Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'Readme.txt' and 'changelog.txt' files for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "File reading sources are used to compose long_description; no data flows to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() calls to read files without error handling; no suspicious code, secrets, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads description files for metadata, defines classifiers, package info, and dependencies. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious operations. The file reading for long_description is typical, although it lacks error handling, which is a minor concern but not malicious. The overall structure is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and standard for Python packaging. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
