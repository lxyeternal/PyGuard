{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python module, defining metadata and reading description files.",
  "sources": "Reading 'Readme.txt' and 'changelog.txt' files for long_description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling; no network or secret leaks",
  "flows": "File reading operations to populate setup parameters; no data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without error handling; filename 'Readme.txt' possibly a typo",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with static file reads and no dynamic or malicious code. No external data, network activity, or secrets are involved. The only minor concern is the lack of error handling for file operations and the filename typo, but these do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Minor issues are non-security related and do not affect the overall safety.",
