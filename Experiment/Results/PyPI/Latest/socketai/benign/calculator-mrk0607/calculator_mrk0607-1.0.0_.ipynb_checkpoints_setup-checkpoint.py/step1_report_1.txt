  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a basic calculator Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'Readme.txt' and 'changelog.txt' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no user input, network, or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> setting long_description -> setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Potential typo in filename 'Readme.txt' (commonly 'README.md' or 'README.txt'); no other unusual code patterns or secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python module. It imports setup tools, defines classifiers, reads description files, and calls setup() with package info. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation. The filename 'Readme.txt' may be a typo but is not malicious. No external data is read from untrusted sources or sent anywhere. The code appears straightforward and typical for a package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
