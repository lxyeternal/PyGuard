  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python calculator package",
  "sources": "Reading 'Readme.txt' and 'changelog.txt' files for long description, importing setuptools for package setup",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is directly used in a vulnerable manner",
  "flows": "Reading files for long description during setup, which is a benign operation, and defining package metadata",
  "anomalies": "Reading 'Readme.txt' and 'changelog.txt' without validation could lead to issues if these files contain malicious content, but it is a standard practice and not inherently malicious. No other anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to configure a Python package. It reads documentation files for the long description, defines package metadata, and specifies dependencies and package inclusion. There are no suspicious code behaviors, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or credential handling. The code structure and logic are standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate and standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It merely prepares package metadata for distribution.",
