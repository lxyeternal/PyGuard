  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of a basic calculator Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading 'Readme.txt' and 'changelog.txt' files for long description, accessing package metadata such as name, version, description, URL, author details, classifiers, keywords, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the code reads files and sets package metadata without executing or processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads ('Readme.txt' and 'changelog.txt') into the 'long_description' parameter, and static strings or variables into setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations observed. The file performs standard package setup procedures. The only potential concern is reading external files, which is typical and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package configuration, reading description files and setting metadata. No user input, environment variables, or external commands are executed. The code appears straightforward and conventional for a Python package setup script. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or suspicious network activity. The use of open() for reading files is standard practice. The overall structure and content do not indicate malicious intent or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It merely reads description files and sets package metadata for distribution.",
