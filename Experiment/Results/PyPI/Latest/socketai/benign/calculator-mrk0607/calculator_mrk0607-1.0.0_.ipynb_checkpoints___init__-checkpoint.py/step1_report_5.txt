{
  "purpose": "Provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root calculation, along with some test print statements.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from hardcoded numeric literals within the function calls (e.g., 7, 8, 4, 5, 25). No external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The only output is via print statements; no untrusted data is sent over network, written to files, or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded numeric literals into functions, then the results are printed. There are no external or untrusted data flows or manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code performs straightforward mathematical calculations with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several simple arithmetic functions and calls them with hardcoded numeric values. The functions perform basic mathematical operations. There is no user input, network activity, or external data handling. The print statements output the results of these calculations. The code appears clean, straightforward, and free from suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple calculator implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, no external data sources, and no security risks. It appears to be benign, with no security concerns identified.",
