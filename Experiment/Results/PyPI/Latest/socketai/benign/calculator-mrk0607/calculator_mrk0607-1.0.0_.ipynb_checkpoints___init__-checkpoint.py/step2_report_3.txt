  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the justification for risk levels.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no external inputs, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The code consists solely of basic arithmetic functions with hardcoded test calls.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are indicated.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The functions are standard and correctly implemented.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Data flows:** Only hardcoded literals and print statements; no external or untrusted data.\n\n### Issues or Flaws:\n- The reports do not identify any issues with the code itself; they all conclude benignity.\n- No logical flaws or security concerns are raised.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — appropriate, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware:** 0 — appropriate, no malware detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — appropriate, no security issues.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since all reports assign a malware score of 0 and the code is trivial, there is no justification for increasing malware or security risk scores.\n- The risk score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a simple, benign demonstration of arithmetic functions with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores and analysis are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
