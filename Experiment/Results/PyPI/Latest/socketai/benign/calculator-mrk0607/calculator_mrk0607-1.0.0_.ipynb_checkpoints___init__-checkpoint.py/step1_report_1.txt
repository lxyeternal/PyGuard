  "purpose": "Basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root calculation.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided directly within function calls; no external data sources or inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are printed to standard output via print statements.",
  "flows": "Inputs to functions are hardcoded literals; output is directly printed, no external data flows or data leaks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation or unusual language features. All functions perform straightforward calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple arithmetic functions and demonstrates their usage with fixed values. There are no external inputs, no data processing from untrusted sources, and no suspicious code behaviors. The functions are basic mathematical operations with safe implementation. The print statements output static results. Overall, the code appears to serve a basic educational or utility purpose without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing straightforward mathematical calculations with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hidden backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads.",
