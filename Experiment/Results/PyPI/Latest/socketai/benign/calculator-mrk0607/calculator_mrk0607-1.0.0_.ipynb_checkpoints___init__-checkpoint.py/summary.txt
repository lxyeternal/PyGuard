  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of basic arithmetic functions with hardcoded test calls. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code."
