  "purpose": "Basic mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root calculation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: num1, num2 in add, sub, mul, div, exp; num1 in sqt.",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output the results of functions.",
  "flows": "Function inputs (num1, num2) are processed internally; results are printed directly without external or untrusted data affecting flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple mathematical functions with straightforward operations. All functions are used with hardcoded literal arguments in print statements, with no external input or data sources. The operations are mathematically valid and standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious side-effects. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation present. The code appears to serve purely as a basic calculator demonstration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, implementing simple mathematical functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not read external untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain malicious patterns.",
