  "purpose": "Basic arithmetic functions with hardcoded test calls demonstrating simple mathematical operations.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded literals in function calls (e.g., add(7,8), div(4,5), exp(4,3), sqt(25)).",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting results; no untrusted data or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Input literals flow directly into arithmetic functions, then results are printed; no external or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines basic arithmetic functions with fixed inputs and outputs, executed via print statements. No external data sources, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The functions perform standard calculations without any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The code is simple, clear, and benign, with no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data leaks. The overall structure and content indicate a benign utility or demonstration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of basic arithmetic functions with hardcoded test calls. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
