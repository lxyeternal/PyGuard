  "flows": "Input parameters to functions, functions returning values, values printed to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious input handling, no network activity, no unusual or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code defines basic arithmetic functions such as add, sub, mul, div, exp, and sqt. These functions perform straightforward mathematical operations with numeric inputs. The code then calls these functions with literal arguments and prints the results. There are no external data sources, no user inputs, and no potentially malicious behaviors like data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The functions and print statements are standard and benign. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be simple utility functions and test calls, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of mathematical functions with test calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and normal in its scope.",
