  "purpose": "Basic mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root calculation.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (num1, num2) and constant literals used in function calls.",
  "targets": "Print statements displaying computed results; no external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through functions and produce output via print statements; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution. Arithmetic functions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines basic arithmetic functions without any malicious or suspicious constructs. The functions operate on provided parameters, and results are printed directly. There are no signs of data leakage, external network communication, or malicious payloads. The code is simple and intended for mathematical calculations only.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, implementing standard mathematical functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious behavior, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
