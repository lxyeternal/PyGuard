  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a basic calculator Python package, including metadata and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'Readme.txt' and 'changelog.txt' files for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads ('Readme.txt' and 'changelog.txt') into the long_description parameter.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() calls during setup for reading description files; no validation or sanitization; no indication of malicious intent, but reliance on external files without validation could be risky if files are maliciously replaced.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads description files and defines package metadata without executing or including any executable code from untrusted sources. There are no code injections, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The open() calls are typical for reading files, and no secrets or credentials are embedded. The overall structure is straightforward and consistent with common packaging practices. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent. It relies on external files for descriptions, which is typical. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
