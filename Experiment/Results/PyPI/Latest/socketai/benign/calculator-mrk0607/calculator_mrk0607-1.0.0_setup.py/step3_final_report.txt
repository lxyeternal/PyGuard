  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, defining metadata and reading description files.",
  "sources": "Reading 'Readme.txt' and 'changelog.txt' files for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data effects present.",
  "flows": "External files are read into variables used in setup(), no data flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without validation or error handling; reliance on external files could be manipulated but is typical in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools. It reads static description files without validation, which is common but could be improved with error handling. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The files are static and used solely for package metadata. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The reliance on external files without validation poses minimal risk in this context, typical for packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The minimal security risk stems from reading external files without validation, which is acceptable in this context. All signals indicate a safe supply chain, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low risk score (~0.1).",
