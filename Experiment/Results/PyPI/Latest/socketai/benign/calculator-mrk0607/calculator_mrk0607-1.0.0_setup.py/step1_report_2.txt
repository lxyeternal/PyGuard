  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'calculator-mrk0607'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'Readme.txt' and 'changelog.txt' files for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Read files for long description during setup; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, defines package classifiers, and calls setup() with metadata including package name, version, description, long description (read from local files), URL, author details, license, classifiers, keywords, packages, and dependencies. It appears to be a standard package configuration script with no unusual code or malicious logic. The only minor concern is the reading of description files without error handling, but that does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It functions solely to define package metadata for distribution.",
