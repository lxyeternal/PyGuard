  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The minimal security risk stems from reading external files without validation, which is acceptable in this context. All signals indicate a safe supply chain, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low risk score (~0.1)."
