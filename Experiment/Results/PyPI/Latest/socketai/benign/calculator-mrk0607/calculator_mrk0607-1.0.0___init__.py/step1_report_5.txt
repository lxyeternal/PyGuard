  "flows": "Inputs (numbers) to functions, then outputs to print",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious data handling, no obfuscated code, and no external data sources or sinks present",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple arithmetic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root. It then calls these functions with constant numeric arguments and prints the results. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious or malicious logic detected. The functions perform straightforward calculations. The print statements only output calculated numerical results. Overall, the code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign set of mathematical functions with test calls. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious operations. The code is safe.",
