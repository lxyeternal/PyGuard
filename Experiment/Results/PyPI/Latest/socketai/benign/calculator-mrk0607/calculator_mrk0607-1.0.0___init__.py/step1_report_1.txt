{
  "purpose": "The code provides basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root calculation, and demonstrates their usage with sample inputs.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are hardcoded function arguments within the code (e.g., 7, 8, 4, 5, 25). There are no external data inputs or user-provided data sources.",
  "sinks": "Print statements output the results of calculations; these are benign and do not pose a security risk.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function arguments through arithmetic operations and then to print statements, with no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The code uses straightforward arithmetic operations with safe inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several basic arithmetic functions and calls them with fixed numeric arguments. All operations are standard mathematical calculations with no external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The functions and calls are safe, and the overall structure is simple and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of basic arithmetic functions with hardcoded inputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be purely educational or demonstrative in nature.",
