{
  "purpose": "Provide basic arithmetic functions and demonstrate their usage with sample inputs.",
  "sources": "Input data is hardcoded within the function calls in the print statements.",
  "sinks": "Output is printed to standard output; no external data sinks are used.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function arguments through the arithmetic operations to the print outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. Functions are standard arithmetic operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple arithmetic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root. These functions are invoked with fixed sample inputs, and results are printed. No external inputs, no data from untrusted sources, and no dynamic code execution or external network activity. The code is straightforward, with clear functionality, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple arithmetic utility with sample usage; it shows no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
