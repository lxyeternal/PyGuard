{
  "purpose": "The code defines basic arithmetic functions and demonstrates their use with fixed inputs, serving as a simple calculator or educational example.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded function arguments within the script",
  "sinks": "Print statements displaying the results of calculations",
  "flows": "Function inputs (constants) → calculations within functions → output via print statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward arithmetic operations with no external data or dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple arithmetic functions (add, sub, mul, div, exp, sqt) with fixed inputs. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The functions perform standard mathematical operations, and the print statements output their results. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code is static, clear, and benign, serving an educational or demonstrative purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of basic arithmetic functions with fixed inputs. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
