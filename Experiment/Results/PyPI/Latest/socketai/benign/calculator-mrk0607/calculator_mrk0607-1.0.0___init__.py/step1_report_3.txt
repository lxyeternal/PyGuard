  "purpose": "Basic mathematical operations and demonstrations of arithmetic functions",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions, specifically 'num1', 'num2' in add, sub, mul, div, exp, and sqt",
  "sinks": "Return statements and print outputs; no external data or system interaction observed",
  "flows": "Function inputs -> calculations -> return or print outputs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines basic arithmetic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root. It then demonstrates their use with fixed arguments and prints the results. There are no external data sources, no user input handling, no network communication, nor any suspicious code patterns. The functions perform straightforward calculations. The print statements are for demonstration only, with no apparent malicious intent or covert behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple mathematical utility script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs arithmetic operations and outputs results for fixed inputs.",
