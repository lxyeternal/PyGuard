  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Summary of the original code:**\n- Defines basic arithmetic functions: add, sub, mul, div, exp, sqt.\n- Calls these functions with fixed inputs and prints results.\n- No external input, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.\n- All operations are straightforward mathematical calculations.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5**:\n- **Purpose:** They state that the code performs basic arithmetic operations with fixed inputs.\n- **Sources:** Hardcoded function arguments.\n- **Sinks:** Print statements.\n- **Flows:** Data flows from function arguments through calculations to output.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** All reports agree that the code is simple, benign, and straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. They assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0, which are appropriate given the content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of scoring:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. Correct, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. Correct, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0. All reports agree on this, which is appropriate.\n\n**Are any adjustments needed?**  \nNo. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the code and descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code does not handle external inputs or execute dynamic code.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The functions are simple and safe.\n- The print statements are benign demonstrations.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the thorough reviews and the code's simplicity, I concur with the existing scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Code presence of issues:** No.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate and justified.\n- **Overall risk assessment:** Very low; the code is benign.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward demonstration of basic arithmetic functions with hardcoded inputs, posing no security or malicious risk. The current scores and assessments are accurate and should remain as they are.",
