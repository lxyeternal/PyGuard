  "purpose": "Basic mathematical operations functions including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root calculation.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (num1, num2) and literals within the code (e.g., 7, 8, 4, 5, 25, 3).",
  "sinks": "Print statements which output results to standard output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical functions, and results are output via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors. No network activity, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of simple mathematical functions with straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several basic mathematical functions and demonstrates their usage with sample inputs. All operations are standard arithmetic calculations. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data leaks, nor any external data handling. The functions perform safe, well-understood operations. No suspicious or malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no external communications, or hidden behaviors. The print statements only output computed results. Overall, the code is straightforward and lacks malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple demonstration of mathematical functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs basic calculations and outputs results. No anomalies or security concerns are present.",
