  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward implementation of basic arithmetic functions with hardcoded inputs.\n- No external data sources, user inputs, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The functions perform standard mathematical operations, and the print statements only output results.\n\n**Assessment of Each Report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**\n   - Purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, analysis, conclusion, confidence all point to benign, simple code.\n   - Malware score: 0, security risk: 0, obfuscated: 0.\n   - **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n2. **Report 2:**\n   - Similar to Report 1, with identical reasoning.\n   - Malware score: 0, security risk: 0, obfuscated: 0.\n   - **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n3. **Report 3:**\n   - Same conclusion: straightforward, safe, no malicious behavior.\n   - Malware score: 0, security risk: 0, obfuscated: 0.\n   - **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n4. **Report 4:**\n   - Again, similar reasoning; no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n   - Malware score: 0, security risk: 0, obfuscated: 0.\n   - **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n5. **Report 5:**\n   - Same assessment: benign, simple arithmetic functions with fixed inputs.\n   - Malware score: 0, security risk: 0, obfuscated: 0.\n   - **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and aligns with the code's actual behavior.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The code is a simple, static demonstration of arithmetic functions with no security concerns.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The scores are appropriate given the code's nature. No changes needed.",
