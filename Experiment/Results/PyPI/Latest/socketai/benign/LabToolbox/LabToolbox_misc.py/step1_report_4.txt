{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for statistical data analysis and visualization, including printing results, plotting histograms, and residuals analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays (x, sigmax, y_data, y_att, sy), parameters, and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "Generates plots using matplotlib, prints statistical measures, and performs calculations on input data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through calculations (e.g., residuals, histogram statistics), to plotting functions, and outputs printed results and visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret keys; no obfuscated code or suspicious variable names; all calculations and plotting appear typical of scientific analysis. No external network calls or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple functions for data analysis: PrintResult formats and prints statistical results; histogram creates histograms with Gaussian overlays; residuals plots residuals with confidence intervals and statistical metrics. The functions perform standard statistical calculations, data normalization, and plotting. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code's structure and variable usage are consistent with scientific data processing routines. No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or malicious data transmission. The code operates solely within the local environment, producing plots and console outputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific data analysis toolkit without any signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It performs standard statistical calculations and visualizations in a typical manner. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
