{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for data analysis and visualization, including printing formatted results, plotting histograms, and residual analysis, primarily used for statistical and experimental data interpretation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters such as x, sigmax, y_data, y_att, and other numerical arrays and parameters passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially influence plotting functions or string formatting, but there are no clear sinks that lead to data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through calculations (e.g., residuals, histograms, statistical metrics) to plotting and printing functions, with no external or network communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or hidden functions, is present. The code strictly performs statistical computations and plotting.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises functions for statistical analysis and visualization, utilizing standard libraries like numpy, matplotlib, and scipy. It performs calculations for mean, sigma, histograms, residuals, and statistical tests, with proper handling of data and no evident malicious activity. No obfuscated code, suspicious string manipulations, or network calls are present. All operations are consistent with normal data analysis tasks. No potential backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful actions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate statistical analysis and plotting utility without malicious intent. It processes data safely, with no signs of sabotage, malware, or security risks.",
