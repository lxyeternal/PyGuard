{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for statistical analysis and visualization, including plotting histograms, residuals, and formatting statistical results.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input arrays passed as function parameters (e.g., x, sigmax, y_data, y_att).",
  "sinks": "Outputs include printed summaries and generated plots; no external data transfer or network activity occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through calculations (mean, sigma, skewness, kurtosis, chi-square) to plotting routines and print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical computations and plotting routines typical in scientific data analysis. It uses common libraries and straightforward logic. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The functions process data passed as arguments, generate visualizations, and print summaries. The only minor concern is the 'securityRisk' score in one report, which is not justified by the code's behavior, as it does not involve external communication or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and intended for scientific data analysis. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and overall security risk is negligible. The slight securityRisk score of 0.2 in one report appears overly cautious and should be lowered to 0.",
