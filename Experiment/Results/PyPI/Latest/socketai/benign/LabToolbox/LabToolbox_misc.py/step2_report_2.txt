  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as statistical analysis and visualization functions, with data coming from function parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks or malicious data flows are indicated.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The code uses standard libraries and performs typical statistical calculations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is legitimate, with high confidence (0.95). No malware or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the functions' roles and data inputs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or data exfiltration evident.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious behaviors. The code is straightforward, using standard libraries.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid conclusion, high confidence (1). No malware or security concerns.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states functions for analysis and visualization.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks or malicious flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is typical for scientific analysis.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9). No malware or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the functions and data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data exfiltration or malicious communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors detected. The mention of \"securityRisk\": 0.2 is notable, but the reasoning is that the code could be misused or has minor vulnerabilities, not that it is malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Reasonable. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects minor concerns, perhaps about misuse, but no malicious activity. Confidence is high (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the functions' roles.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code performs standard statistical analysis.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate, with high confidence (0.95). No malware or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code behavior:** All reports agree that the code performs standard statistical analysis and plotting functions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors in any report.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign a very low or zero security risk, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no significant security risk.\n\n**Note:** The only minor point is the \"securityRisk\" score of 0.2 in report 4, which seems to reflect a cautious stance about potential misuse rather than actual malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided code is a legitimate scientific data analysis utility, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.",
