{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for statistical analysis, data visualization (histograms, residual plots), and formatting of results, likely intended for scientific data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters passed to functions (x, sigmax, y_data, y_att, sy, etc.). Uses imported libraries for mathematical operations and plotting.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted strings and plots. No data is written to external locations, files, or network communications within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through calculations (e.g., residuals, histograms) to visualization and print statements. No untrusted data flow to external systems is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. Commented out code is harmless and typical in development.",
  "analysis": "The code predominantly performs statistical plotting and formatting functions. It uses standard libraries (numpy, matplotlib, scipy.stats) for common statistical tasks. The calculations involve standard formulas for histograms, residuals, skewness, kurtosis, and confidence intervals. No external communication, file I/O, or malicious commands are present. The code does not contain obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns. The import statement 'from LabToolbox import ...' suggests reliance on external, possibly custom, libraries, but nothing malicious is inferred from their usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data analysis utility with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs standard statistical and plotting functions typical in scientific data analysis. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage activities are detected.",
