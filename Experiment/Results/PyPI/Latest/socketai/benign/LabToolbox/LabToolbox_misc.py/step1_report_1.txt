{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for statistical data analysis and visualization, including printing formatted results, plotting histograms, and residuals analysis for data fitting.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include arrays from parameters such as x, sigmax, y_data, y_att, sy, and other parameters for plotting functions; these are passed as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code generates plots and prints statistical summaries; no data is written to files, sent over the network, or used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays into statistical calculations (mean, sigma, skewness, kurtosis) and into plotting functions. Calculated residuals and statistical metrics are displayed via print and plot functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, backdoors, or hidden functionalities are present. No hard-coded credentials, external network calls, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard statistical and plotting libraries (numpy, scipy.stats, matplotlib) to analyze and visualize data. Functions are well-structured, with no indication of malicious intent. All calculations involve common statistical formulas (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, chi-square) and standard plotting procedures. There are no signs of code injection, network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's complexity and operations are consistent with legitimate data analysis tasks. The only potential concern might be if the functions are misused with malicious data, but as written, there is no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data analysis and visualization script with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs standard statistical computations and plotting, adhering to expected behaviors for such tasks.",
