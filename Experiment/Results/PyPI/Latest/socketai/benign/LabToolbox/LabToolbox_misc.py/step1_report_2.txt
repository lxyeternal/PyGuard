{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for statistical data analysis and visualization, including result printing, histogram plotting, and residuals analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from array-like parameters such as x, sigmax, y_data, y_att, sy, and other parameters passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct data sinks that send data over a network or write to files; it primarily generates plots and prints output to the console.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions (histogram, residuals, PrintResult) which process the data and generate visual outputs (plots) or print statements; no external data transfer or malicious data exfiltration is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and well-structured; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected. There are no hidden or malicious behaviors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of several data analysis and plotting functions, including statistical calculations, histogram plotting with Gaussian fits, and residuals analysis. All operations involve standard mathematical and plotting routines. No network communication, file writing, or other potentially malicious behaviors are present. The use of external libraries (LabToolbox, numpy, scipy, matplotlib) is consistent with typical scientific workflows. The code performs calculations, plotting, and printing of statistical metrics without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code performs data analysis and visualization tasks typical for scientific scripts. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. All operations are consistent with legitimate data processing and visualization. Therefore, it can be considered safe based on the provided code fragment.",
