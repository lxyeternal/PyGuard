  "purpose": "The code provides functions to propagate uncertainty through numerical derivatives and Monte Carlo or delta methods, for uncertainty analysis in scientific computations.",
  "sources": "Input arrays `x_vars`, `sigma_x`, and `x_arrays`; data read within `uncert_prop` initialization and `np.diff`; function inputs `f`, `func`, `uncertainties`, `params`.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data points used in derivative calculations and uncertainty propagation; `uncert_prop` potentially using external data sources.",
  "flows": "Input data → Numerical derivative or Monte Carlo simulation → Calculation of uncertainties and confidence bands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code, malicious system calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms observed. Usage of external library `uncert_prop` is standard for uncertainty analysis and does not by itself suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard numerical methods for uncertainty propagation, including finite differences and Monte Carlo simulations. It reads input data arrays and uncertainties, performs derivative calculations, and uses an external library `uncert_prop` for Monte Carlo uncertainty estimation. All data handling appears consistent with scientific computing practices. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or system manipulation are evident. The external dependency `uncert_prop` is a known library for uncertainty analysis, not inherently suspicious. The code’s structure and content are typical for scientific analysis scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical scientific uncertainty propagation implementation with no apparent malicious intent. It uses standard libraries and techniques, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
