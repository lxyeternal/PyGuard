  "purpose": "The code implements numerical and probabilistic uncertainty propagation methods for scientific analysis, utilizing finite differences and Monte Carlo techniques via an external 'uncert_prop' library.",
  "sources": "Input arrays 'x_vars' and 'uncertainties', as well as parameters passed to functions, where data is read for processing.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'uncert_prop' methods for uncertainty calculations; no external data transmission or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through derivative calculations or into 'uncert_prop' for probabilistic analysis, with results returned as propagated uncertainties and confidence bands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; external dependencies are standard for scientific computing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard uncertainty propagation techniques, including finite difference derivatives and Monte Carlo simulations. Input validation is present; data handling is consistent. Usage of 'uncert_prop' appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system tampering is evident. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with typical scientific analysis practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific tool for uncertainty analysis, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities detected. External dependencies are used appropriately, and the code structure does not suggest obfuscation or sabotage. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score of 0.2 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
