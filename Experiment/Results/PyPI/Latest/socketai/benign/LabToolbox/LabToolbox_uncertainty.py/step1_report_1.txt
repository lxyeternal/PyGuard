  "purpose": "This code performs uncertainty propagation in numerical functions, calculating propagated uncertainties and confidence bands using derivative approximation and Monte Carlo methods.",
  "sources": "Input arrays x_vars and uncertainties; function f; parameters params; method parameter; MC_sample_size parameter.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into uncertainty_propagator.SEM() and confband() methods; potential data leaks or external network interactions are not evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays and uncertainties into uncertainty propagation calculations; derivative-based and Monte Carlo methods process data to output uncertainties and confidence bands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior observed. Use of a custom 'uncert_prop' class might warrant review, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for uncertainty propagation, utilizing derivative approximation and Monte Carlo methods via an imported 'uncert_prop' class. It reads input data arrays and uncertainties, computes derivatives or performs Monte Carlo simulations, and outputs propagated uncertainties and confidence intervals. The code appears to be a standard implementation for scientific calculations, with no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is minimal and appears legitimate. The functions handle data validation, array copying, and parameter passing appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard scientific uncertainty propagation functions with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It uses legitimate calculations, input handling, and data flow. There are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies detected that would suggest malicious code or malware.",
