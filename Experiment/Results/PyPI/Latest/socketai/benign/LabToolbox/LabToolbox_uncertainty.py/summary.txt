  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific tool for uncertainty analysis, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities detected. External dependencies are used appropriately, and the code structure does not suggest obfuscation or sabotage. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score of 0.2 are justified and consistent with the analysis."
