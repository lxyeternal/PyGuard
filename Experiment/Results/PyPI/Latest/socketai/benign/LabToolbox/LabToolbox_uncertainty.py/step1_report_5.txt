  "purpose": "The code provides functions for propagating uncertainty through mathematical models, specifically via numerical derivatives and Monte Carlo or delta methods, to estimate output uncertainty based on input uncertainties.",
  "sources": "Reads input arrays (x_vars, x_arrays), parameters (params), and uncertainties (sigma_x, uncertainties). Calls external functions and modules, including LabToolbox and uncert_prop.",
  "sinks": "Uses the uncert_prop class for uncertainty propagation, which may perform statistical computations. Does not contain any sinks that leak data externally or send data over networks.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the input arrays and uncertainties to the functions, which compute derivatives or propagate uncertainty via uncert_prop, returning results including confidence bands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names. No unusual code constructs. The code uses external uncertainty propagation library but does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'uncertainty_diff' for numerical derivative-based uncertainty propagation, and 'propagate_uncertainty' which utilizes an external 'uncert_prop' class for uncertainty propagation, supporting Monte Carlo and delta methods. Both functions perform standard numerical and statistical computations for uncertainty propagation. They validate input sizes, create derivative estimates, and utilize an external library for uncertainty estimation. No data exfiltration, system manipulation, or network activity is observed. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are present. The external library is used for statistical processing, which is common in scientific applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard scientific computation tool for uncertainty analysis, with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is well-structured, uses external libraries appropriately, and does not contain suspicious code segments. Overall, it is safe with low security risk.",
