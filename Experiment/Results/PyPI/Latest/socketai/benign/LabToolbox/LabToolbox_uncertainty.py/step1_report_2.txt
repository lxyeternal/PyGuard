{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for propagating uncertainty through numerical and Monte Carlo methods, enabling uncertainty analysis of mathematical models with input variabilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data arrays (x_vars, x_arrays), function parameters, and uncertainties. It also imports modules 'LabToolbox', 'np', and 'uncert_prop'.",
  "sinks": "The code calls functions from 'uncert_prop' which may perform probabilistic calculations. It does not perform data leaks or system modifications. No network, file, or sensitive data operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data arrays are used as sources; uncertainties are modeled via covariance matrices; wrapped functions and uncertainty propagators process data to produce uncertainty estimates and confidence bands.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The imported module 'LabToolbox' is non-standard and could be examined further for malicious functions, but no such behaviors are evident here. The use of external libraries for uncertainty propagation is consistent with scientific computation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for uncertainty propagation: 'uncertainty_diff' uses numerical derivatives, and 'propagate_uncertainty' offers a flexible approach via Monte Carlo or delta methods. Both functions validate input sizes, generate necessary computations, and utilize the 'uncert_prop' class for probabilistic analysis. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or system harm behaviors are present. The code's structure is typical for scientific uncertainty analysis. 'LabToolbox' is an external, possibly custom module; its content is unknown, but no suspicious activities are apparent from its usage here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for uncertainty propagation in scientific models. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. Its purpose is scientific, not malicious. No signs of sabotage or harmful activities are present.",
