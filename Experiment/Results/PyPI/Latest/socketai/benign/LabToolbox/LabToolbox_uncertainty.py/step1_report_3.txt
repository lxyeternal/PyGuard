  "purpose": "The code provides functions for propagating uncertainty through mathematical models, specifically using numerical derivatives and Monte Carlo methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input arrays (x_vars, x_arrays) and parameters, and calls user-defined functions (f, func).",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations with the results of these functions, including computing derivatives, propagating uncertainties, and generating confidence bands.",
  "flows": "Input data from x_vars/x_arrays is processed through function calls; uncertainties are used to compute covariance matrices; the uncertainty propagator processes these inputs to produce output uncertainties and confidence intervals.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. Use of external library 'uncertainty_prop' appears consistent with its intended purpose. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard numerical uncertainty propagation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'uncertainty_diff', which calculates numerical derivatives for uncertainty propagation, and 'propagate_uncertainty', which handles general uncertainty propagation using either delta or Monte Carlo methods. Both functions include input validation and perform calculations according to common practices. The 'uncertainty_diff' uses finite differences with adaptive step size based on data spacing, which is standard. The 'propagate_uncertainty' constructs covariance matrices from provided uncertainties or assumes diagonal covariance. It then creates an 'uncert_prop' object to perform the propagation, calling methods to compute uncertainties and confidence bands. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network communication, file operations, or system modification, is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for uncertainty propagation in numerical models. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or malware. Its purpose is to facilitate uncertainty analysis, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
