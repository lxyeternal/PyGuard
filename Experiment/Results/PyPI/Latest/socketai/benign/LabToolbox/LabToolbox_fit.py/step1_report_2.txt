{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for performing linear and general curve fitting with visualization, including uncertainty propagation and residual analysis, primarily for data analysis and visualization in scientific contexts.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data arrays (x, y, sy, sx), model parameters (p0), bounds, and options for plot configuration; it also reads from imported modules and functions such as LabToolbox, sm, np, plt, chi2.",
  "sinks": "The code generates plots for data and fit results, including residuals and confidence intervals; it does not include any network connections, file writing, or system modification operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays into model fitting functions, propagates through calculations of residuals and uncertainties, and outputs plots with annotations and fit parameters; no external data transfer or malicious data handling is observed.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code constructs; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious functions are present. The code appears to be standard scientific data analysis routines. No obfuscated language features or misleading variable names are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two main functions for data fitting and visualization: 'lin_fit' and 'model_fit'. Both functions perform data fitting using robust statistical methods, compute fit parameters, uncertainties, and statistical metrics such as chi-square and p-value, then generate detailed plots including residuals and confidence intervals. All computations involve standard libraries, and the plotting routines use standard matplotlib calls. No external network calls, file modifications, or system commands are present. The functions seem designed solely for scientific data analysis, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. The import statements suggest reliance on open-source or trusted libraries. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate scientific analysis utility, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard scientific data fitting and visualization module with no malicious behavior detected. It performs data analysis tasks securely and transparently, with no indicators of sabotage, backdoors, or harmful operations.",
