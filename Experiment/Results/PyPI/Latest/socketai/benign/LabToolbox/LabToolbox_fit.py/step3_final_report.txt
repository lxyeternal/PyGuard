{
  "purpose": "The code performs linear fitting (weighted or ordinary least squares) and visualization, including residuals and confidence intervals, for scientific data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays (x, y, sy, sx), and uses functions from 'LabToolbox' for statistical calculations and plotting.",
  "sinks": "No external network, file, or system modifications; all operations are local computations and visualizations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through statistical calculations, fit results, and into plotting routines for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden malicious operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries and functions for data fitting, residual analysis, and plotting. It does not perform network communication, file manipulation beyond visualization, or any obfuscated code segments. The scoring in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) aligns with the code's benign and transparent nature. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific analysis utility with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
