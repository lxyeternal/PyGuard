  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the security implications, potential malicious signals, and the consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code performs standard linear fitting and visualization, with residuals, confidence intervals, and uncertainty propagation. No network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious behavior observed.\n\n- **Security Risk**: 0.2 — very low, considering the code's scientific purpose and absence of suspicious operations.\n\n- **Justification**: The code is purely computational and visualization, with no external communication or hidden malicious logic. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, standard fitting and plotting routines, no network or malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — consistent with the absence of malicious signals.\n\n- **Security Risk**: 0 — appropriate given the code's straightforward nature.\n\n- **Justification**: The detailed reasoning confirms no malicious behavior. The score remains reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Same as previous, standard data fitting, residuals, and plotting, no external or malicious operations.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no signs of malware.\n\n- **Security Risk**: 0 — justified.\n\n- **Justification**: The code is typical for scientific analysis; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, standard fitting and visualization routines, no suspicious code or external activity.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — aligns with the findings.\n\n- **Security Risk**: 0 — justified.\n\n- **Justification**: No malicious signals detected; the code is a legitimate data analysis tool.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Same pattern—scientific fitting and plotting, no external activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — consistent.\n\n- **Security Risk**: 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Justification**: No malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports indicate no obfuscation, score = 0.\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports agree on 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n- **Risk Score**: The minimal risk scores (0 or 0.2) are reasonable, considering the code's purpose and lack of malicious features.\n\n---\n\n### Final Step: My own estimates\n\n- **Malware**: 0 — no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — code is clear, well-structured, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk**: 0.1 — very low, given the purely scientific and visualization functions, no external data leaks, no network activity, and no hidden code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate. The code appears to be a legitimate scientific analysis utility with no security concerns.",
