  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Describes standard data fitting and visualization functions. Uses imported functions from 'LabToolbox' and standard plotting.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No external network, file, or system modifications; flows are local computations and plotting.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Uses standard libraries for scientific computation.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Confident (0.95), no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Assessment**: The analysis is accurate. The code performs typical scientific tasks with no malicious intent. The high confidence and zero malware score are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Similar to Report 1, standard data fitting, residuals, and plotting routines.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No external communication; purely computational and visualization.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No suspicious code constructs or malicious patterns. Uses trusted libraries.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: High confidence (1.0), no malware or security risk.\n\n**Assessment**: Correct. The code is standard scientific analysis code, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Same as above, focusing on data fitting, residuals, and visualization.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No external data transfer or system modification.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No obfuscation or malicious code detected. Uses standard libraries and practices.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: High confidence (1.0), no malware.\n\n**Assessment**: The evaluation is accurate. The code is typical for scientific data analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Consistent with previous reports—fitting, residuals, plotting.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No external data leaks or malicious operations.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No suspicious code or obfuscation. Uses standard scientific libraries.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: High confidence (1.0), no malware.\n\n**Assessment**: Correct. The code is a straightforward data analysis utility.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Same as others—fitting and visualization.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No external data transmission or malicious activity.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Uses standard libraries.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: High confidence (1.0), no malware.\n\n**Assessment**: Accurate. The code is a typical scientific analysis script.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware scores**: All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's content. No malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores**: All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk scores**: Very low (0.2 or 0), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** — code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard libraries.\n\n- **Risk score**: **0.1 - 0.2** — minimal risk, primarily due to plotting routines that could, in theory, be exploited if inputs are malicious, but no evidence of such.\n\n**Overall conclusion**: The code is a legitimate scientific data analysis module for fitting and visualization, with no malicious or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation**: Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The risk score could be slightly increased if considering potential misuse of plotting routines, but overall, it remains very low.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: ~0.2 (due to potential for misuse in plotting, but no actual malicious activity detected)",
