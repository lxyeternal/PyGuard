  "purpose": "Scientific utility for uncertainty propagation analysis, supporting Monte Carlo and delta methods.",
  "sources": "Input variables 'x', function 'func', covariance matrix 'cov_matrix', sampling parameters, and data used for plotting.",
  "sinks": "Plot outputs, console messages; no external data transmission or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs into sampling, gradient computation, statistical analysis, and plotting routines.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard statistical and plotting functions for uncertainty analysis, with proper use of libraries. Error handling via print and sys.exit() is typical. No malicious behavior, external communication, or obfuscation is present. The logic is straightforward and consistent with its scientific purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard scientific utility for uncertainty propagation with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, aligning with the analysis.",
