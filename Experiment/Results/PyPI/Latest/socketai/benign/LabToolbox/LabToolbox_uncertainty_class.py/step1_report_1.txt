{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for uncertainty propagation analysis of a scalar function with options for Monte Carlo and delta methods, including plotting capabilities.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include function 'func', variable array 'x', covariance matrix 'cov_matrix', and optional parameters such as method and sample size.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; plotting functions save figures to files, but do not transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into class attributes, which are used to generate Monte Carlo samples or compute gradients, and then to statistical calculations and plots.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code structures are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of uncertainty analysis routines with plotting. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports well-known scientific libraries and defines a class with methods for Monte Carlo sampling, gradient calculation, plotting, and confidence interval computation. The class appears to be a straightforward utility for uncertainty propagation, with no signs of external data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior. All functions perform expected statistical and plotting operations. The use of cache decorators and plotting routines are standard and do not raise suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical scientific utility for uncertainty analysis with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It functions as an analytical tool without performing any harmful actions. No security risks are apparent based on the provided code.",
