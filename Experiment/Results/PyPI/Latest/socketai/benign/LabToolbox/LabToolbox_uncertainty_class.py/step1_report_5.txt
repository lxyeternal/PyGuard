{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for uncertainty propagation analysis of scalar functions with respect to input variables, supporting Monte Carlo and delta methods for uncertainty quantification, as well as plotting functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads input variables 'x' and 'cov_matrix' from arguments during initialization; uses 'func' callable; reads 'MC_sample_size' and 'method' parameters; accesses class attributes for computations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs plots to files via 'save_name' parameters; prints messages to console; computes and returns numerical results for uncertainty measures.",
  "flows": "Input 'x' and 'cov_matrix' are used to generate Monte Carlo samples or compute gradients; samples and gradients are used to calculate uncertainty measures; results are visualized or returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Usage of standard scientific libraries and straightforward method implementations. No obfuscated code or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation for uncertainty analysis, using standard techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation and delta method. It employs caching for sample generation and distribution plotting, and performs calculations for confidence bands. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage mechanisms are present. It relies on publicly known libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn) and does not contain any suspicious external network activity or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific utility for propagating uncertainties in scalar functions with respect to input variables. There are no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It functions as intended for scientific and engineering uncertainty quantification without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
