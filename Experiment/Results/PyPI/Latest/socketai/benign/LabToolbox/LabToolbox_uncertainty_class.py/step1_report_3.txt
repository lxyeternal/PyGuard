{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for uncertainty propagation analysis of scalar functions with methods for Monte Carlo sampling, gradient computation, and plotting distributions. It appears intended for statistical and numerical analysis in scientific applications.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from class attributes 'x' and 'cov_matrix', and the function 'func'. Uses external libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn) for data processing and plotting.",
  "sinks": "Produces visualizations (plots) of distributions; no evidence of data leakage, external network communication, or data exfiltration; no file writing or system modification beyond plotting.",
  "flows": "Input data ('x', 'cov_matrix') used to generate samples ('x_MC_samples') and evaluate the function ('f_MC'). Results are plotted for analysis, with no evidence of untrusted data flows outside intended outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code segments observed. The code relies on standard numerical methods and plotting routines without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a class for uncertainty quantification, using standard numerical techniques: Monte Carlo sampling from multivariate normal distributions, numerical gradient approximation, and plotting via matplotlib. The code checks input validity, uses caching for repeated calculations, and provides statistical methods for confidence bands. No network operations, file manipulations (beyond saving plots), or malicious behaviors are present. The functions are straightforward, and external libraries are used as intended. The code appears to be a legitimate scientific computation utility with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of uncertainty analysis tools with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a benign scientific computation module.",
