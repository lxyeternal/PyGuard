{
  "purpose": "Importing various scientific computing and statistical libraries for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy, math, matplotlib, statsmodels, scipy, and a custom external module 'uncert_prop'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present; the code is primarily import statements.",
  "flows": "The imports bring in functionalities for computations and plotting, but no data flow from untrusted sources or sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The __all__ list clearly defines exported symbols, indicating intentional modularization.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from well-known scientific libraries and a custom module, along with a __all__ export list. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution present. No signs of malicious or suspicious activity are detected. The use of standard libraries and explicit exports suggests legitimate purpose. The code appears to be a typical setup for a scientific data analysis script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements for data analysis, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard setup for a scientific project.",
