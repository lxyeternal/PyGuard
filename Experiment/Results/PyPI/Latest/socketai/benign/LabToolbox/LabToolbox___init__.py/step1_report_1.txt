{
  "purpose": "The code imports various scientific computing libraries and modules, likely to perform data analysis, statistical modeling, or visualization tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy, math, matplotlib, statsmodels, scipy, and a custom external module 'uncertainty_class'. No input reading or data ingestion is explicitly shown in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in this snippet. The code only imports modules and specifies exports.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as this code only consists of import statements and module exports without executing any logic or processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behaviors are evident. All imported modules are standard for scientific Python workflows. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import section establishing dependencies for a scientific or statistical project. It imports standard numerical and plotting libraries (numpy, math, matplotlib, statsmodels), specific scipy modules, and a custom external class 'uncert_prop'. The '__all__' list defines what symbols are exported. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated segments, or hidden behaviors. It appears to be a benign setup for subsequent data analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard, benign setup for scientific data analysis and visualization. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The code's purpose is to prepare the environment with necessary libraries and modules.",
