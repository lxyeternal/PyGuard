{
  "purpose": "Import various scientific computing libraries and define exports for a Python module related to statistical and data analysis.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports and external package imports; specifically numpy, math, matplotlib, statsmodels, scipy, and a local custom module 'uncert_prop'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; code primarily imports libraries and defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only performs imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements from common scientific libraries and a local custom module. It also specifies an __all__ list for module exports, which is typical in Python packages. There are no dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious logic. The imports are all from reputable sources, and no network or file operations are present that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of import statements for a scientific Python module. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears legitimate and focused on data analysis functionalities.",
