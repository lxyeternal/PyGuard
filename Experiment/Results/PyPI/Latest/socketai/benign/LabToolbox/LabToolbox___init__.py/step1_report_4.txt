{
  "purpose": "The code imports various mathematical, statistical, and plotting libraries for data analysis and visualization, along with a custom module 'uncert_prop' for uncertainty calculations.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy, math, matplotlib, statsmodels, scipy, and a local module 'uncert_prop'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing points identified; the code is only importing modules and defining __all__.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all statements are imports and a list definition.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is standard library import statements and __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements for well-known libraries and a local module, with an explicit __all__ list for exports. There are no dynamic code executions, data handling, or network operations. The code appears to serve as a module setup or initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import and export declaration for a Python module related to data analysis, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
