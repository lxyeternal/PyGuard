{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an import setup for a scientific Python project, importing various libraries and defining the module's exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from numpy, math, matplotlib, statsmodels, scipy, and a custom module 'uncert_prop'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data from sources to sinks; only static imports are used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a module export list (__all__). It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All imported modules are reputable scientific libraries, and the custom module 'uncert_prop' appears to be a legitimate dependency. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as safe.",
