  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code, focusing on potential security concerns, correctness, and consistency of the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, performing statistical calculations and formatting, with no external data sources, network activity, or file I/O.\n- The only potential concern raised is the import statement: `from LabToolbox import np`. Without additional context, this could be a custom or obscure package, which might be suspicious if malicious.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious logic, or backdoors is present in the code snippets themselves.\n- The functions are standard and mathematically sound.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Presence & Code Analysis**\n\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  The reports correctly state that the code is benign and performs standard statistical functions. No malicious or suspicious code segments are identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and thorough. They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, external data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- They do mention the import from `LabToolbox`, which could be an external or custom package, but this alone isn't a security issue unless the package is malicious. The reports appropriately flag this as a potential concern but do not assume malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Score Justifications & Recommendations**\n\n#### **Malware Score:**\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of **0**, which is appropriate given the code content.\n- **Justification:** No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present.\n\n#### **Obfuscated Score:**\n\n- All reports assign **0**, which is correct.\n- **Justification:** The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n\n#### **Security Risk Score:**\n\n- Most reports assign **0.1** or **0**, citing the import from `LabToolbox` as a minor concern.\n- **Recommendation:** Since the code itself is benign, and the only potential concern is the origin of `LabToolbox`, a security risk score of **0** or **0.1** is reasonable. If `LabToolbox` is untrusted, that could elevate the risk slightly, but without evidence of malicious behavior, a low score suffices.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Overestimations or Underestimations**\n\n- The scores seem reasonable; none are inflated.\n- Given the benign nature of the code, a **malware** score of **0** and an **obfuscated** score of **0** are justified.\n- The **security risk** could be marginally increased if `LabToolbox` is untrusted, but with no evidence, keeping it at **0.1** or **0** is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Risk Assessment & Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear.\n- **Security risk score:** **0.1** — minimal concern due to external import, but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the source of `LabToolbox`, which warrants verification but does not impact the code's security directly.\n\n---\n\n**Final Note:**  \nIf I were to assign my own estimates based on this review, I would keep:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to external dependency)  \n\nThese are consistent with the detailed analyses and the evidence provided.",
