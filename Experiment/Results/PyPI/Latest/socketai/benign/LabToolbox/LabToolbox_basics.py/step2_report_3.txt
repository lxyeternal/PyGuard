  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, correctness of the scoring, and consistency with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a collection of statistical functions and formatting routines.\n- The code imports 'np' from 'LabToolbox', which could be a custom or obscure module. While this is unusual, it does not inherently indicate malicious intent.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data exfiltration points are identified.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The functions perform standard statistical calculations and formatting, with appropriate handling of edge cases.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The functions are straightforward and perform standard statistical operations. No issues are present.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports identify any malicious activity, and the code does not contain any suspicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is detected.\n- **Security risks:** The overall security risk is minimal, mainly due to the import of 'LabToolbox', which could be untrusted but is not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Review of scores:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Justification:** The code performs benign statistical functions; no malware or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation detected.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- Mostly very low (0 or 0.1), consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Justification:** No external data leaks, no system calls, no network activity, and no malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only point of concern is the import statement: `from LabToolbox import np`. If 'LabToolbox' is malicious or compromised, it could introduce risks. However, based solely on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior originating from this import.\n- The reports correctly do not assign higher scores based solely on the import.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports seem reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No adjustments are necessary unless further context about 'LabToolbox' is provided.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to the import, but not a direct security risk)\n\nThe code is benign, standard, and safe for supply chain purposes, assuming 'LabToolbox' is trustworthy.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's content. No malicious or obfuscated activity is detected, and the low security risk score is justified.",
