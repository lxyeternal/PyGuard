  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, performing standard statistical calculations and formatting.\n- The import from 'LabToolbox' is noted but not suspicious without further context.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or file operations are present.\n- No obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which seems appropriate given the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, benign code, import from 'LabToolbox' noted but not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 (low, possibly due to external import concern).\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk is reasonable, but the malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity, import noted.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, straightforward functions, no external threats.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, standard functions.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, functions are typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is justified given the code content.\n- **Security risk scores:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Potential issues:** The only external concern is the import from 'LabToolbox', which could be malicious if the package is compromised. However, the code itself does not demonstrate malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** Based on the detailed review, I agree with the current scores:\n  - Malware: 0 for all reports.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 for all reports.\n  - Security risk: Very low, mostly 0, with a slight 0.1 in the first report due to external import.\n\n- **Additional note:** If the 'LabToolbox' package is untrusted or malicious, that could introduce security concerns outside this code snippet. But based solely on the code and reports, the current scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1 (very low, mostly due to external import, but not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, well within safe bounds for supply chain security. No adjustments needed unless further context about 'LabToolbox' emerges.",
