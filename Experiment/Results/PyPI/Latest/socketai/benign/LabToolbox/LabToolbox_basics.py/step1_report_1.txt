{
  "purpose": "The code provides statistical functions for data analysis and formatting numerical output with uncertainties, including mean, covariance, variance, linear modeling, and value formatting.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data sources explicitly. It relies on input parameters provided to functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data leakage or external communication sinks are present. No code writes to files, sends network requests, or exposes data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data; the functions process data passed as arguments without external data interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present. The import statement imports 'np' from 'LabToolbox', which may be a custom module; however, this is not inherently suspicious. All functions perform standard statistical calculations and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward statistical functions that rely on numpy operations, with no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The import from 'LabToolbox' could be unusual if 'LabToolbox' is a custom or obscure package, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The functions perform typical calculations and formatting with proper handling of edge cases, errors, and units. No external or untrusted data sources are accessed, and no suspicious side-effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign collection of statistical and formatting functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The import from 'LabToolbox' is noted but not suspicious without further context. Overall, the code does not present security concerns.",
