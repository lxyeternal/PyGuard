{
  "purpose": "The code provides statistical functions for data analysis, including weighted mean, covariance, variance, linear modeling, and value formatting with error propagation.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data inputs are read; all data appears to come from function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations like network I/O, file writing, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are confined within mathematical computations and formatting functions; no external or untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard mathematical operations and formatting techniques.",
  "analysis": "The functions implement common statistical calculations and formatting, with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or suspicious behavior. The use of numpy for numerical operations is standard; no external data sources or sinks are present. The formatting function includes error handling and scaling, which are typical for scientific data presentation. No malicious or harmful code behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of statistical and formatting functions with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use in data analysis contexts.",
