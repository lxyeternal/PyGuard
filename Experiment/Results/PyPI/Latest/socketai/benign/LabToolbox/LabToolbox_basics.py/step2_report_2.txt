  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, focusing on the security implications, correctness, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, performing statistical calculations and formatting, with no suspicious behavior. The import from 'LabToolbox' is noted but not suspicious.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code itself is straightforward and safe.\n  - The only concern is the import of 'LabToolbox'. Without further context, this could be a local or obscure package, but not inherently malicious.\n  - The security risk score of 0.1 seems slightly elevated given the benign code; perhaps it accounts for the unknown source of 'LabToolbox'.\n\n- **Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the import from 'LabToolbox' as a potential concern.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Slightly more conservative with securityRisk=0, reflecting that the code itself is benign.\n  - The import remains a potential vector but without evidence, scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard, with no external data source or suspicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Fully aligned with the benign nature of the code.\n  - No concerns about obfuscation or malware.\n\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, straightforward statistical functions, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Fully consistent with the code content.\n\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard statistical and formatting functions, no external threats.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.95, obfuscated=0\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Slightly lower confidence but still high.\n  - No suspicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. No evidence suggests malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly varies but remains low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the unknown 'LabToolbox' import.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The import from 'LabToolbox' is the only external factor that could pose a risk if the package is malicious or compromised. If 'LabToolbox' is an obscure or untrusted package, a higher security risk score might be warranted. However, based solely on the code, no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the code's content and context.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (to reflect potential concern about 'LabToolbox' source, but overall low risk)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior. The minor security concern hinges on the trustworthiness of 'LabToolbox', which cannot be assessed here but does not impact the code's internal security. The scores provided are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
