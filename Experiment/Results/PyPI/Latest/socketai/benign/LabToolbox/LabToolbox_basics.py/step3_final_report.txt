{
  "purpose": "The code provides statistical functions for mean, covariance, variance, linear modeling, and formatted output, likely for data analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters; no external data sources or user inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not write to files, network, or system resources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into calculations within functions; no external untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The import from 'LabToolbox' is unusual and could be a custom or obscure package, but this alone is not suspicious or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard statistical functions and formatting routines, with clear logic and no obfuscation. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The only external dependency is 'LabToolbox', which could be a source of concern if untrusted, but the code itself does not demonstrate malicious activity. The scoring aligns with this assessment, assigning zero malware and obfuscation scores, and a very low security risk score (0.1) primarily due to the external import. Overall, the code appears benign and safe for supply chain use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, free of malicious behavior, and well-structured. The only minor concern is the external 'LabToolbox' import, which warrants trust verification outside this code review. The provided scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
