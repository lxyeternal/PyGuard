{
  "purpose": "The code provides statistical functions for weighted mean, covariance, variance, linear modeling, error propagation, and formatting numerical outputs, likely used in data analysis or scientific reporting.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read untrusted input or external data sources; data is passed as function arguments. The code imports 'np' from 'LabToolbox', which is presumed to be a local or third-party library.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or dangerous system calls are present; the code performs mathematical calculations only.",
  "flows": "The calculations operate on data passed into functions, with no external data flow or untrusted input processing occurring within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code features are present. The functions perform standard statistical operations. The import from 'LabToolbox' could be suspicious if 'LabToolbox' is malicious or untrusted, but this is external and not evident from this code alone.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of statistical and formatting functions: weighted mean, covariance, variance, linear model calculations, error propagation, and value formatting. All functions perform straightforward mathematical operations with no evidence of malicious behavior. The import statement from 'LabToolbox' could be a concern if the package is malicious, but based solely on this code, there is no indication of malicious intent. No external data inputs or system calls are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic patterns are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard statistical utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior. The only potential concern is the imported 'LabToolbox', which should be verified for trustworthiness, but that is outside the scope of this code review. Overall, the code is safe based on the provided content.",
