  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, correctness of scoring, and consistency with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, straightforward statistical functions with no suspicious behavior. The only concern is the import from 'LabToolbox', which could be a custom or obscure package, but this alone isn't malicious.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** Given the benign nature and no evidence of malicious activity, the malware score is appropriate at 0. The security risk is minimal, as the only potential concern is the import source, which isn't inherently malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the import from 'LabToolbox' being a potential concern if malicious.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies no malicious activity. The security risk score is zero, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The functions are standard, with no malicious behavior. The only concern is the import from 'LabToolbox'.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** The scores are consistent with the analysis. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard statistical functions with no suspicious behavior. No external data or system interactions.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the scores.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard for scientific data processing, with no malicious activity. No external data sources or system interactions.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low risk (0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the benign analysis.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\nBased on the review, **the current scores are justified and consistent** with the code content and analysis. The only external concern is the import from 'LabToolbox', which warrants verification of the package's trustworthiness, but this is outside the scope of this code review.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (acknowledging the import source as a minor concern, but not malicious)\n\nThe code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious activity.",
