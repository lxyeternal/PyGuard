{
  "purpose": "The code provides statistical functions for data analysis and formatting numerical outputs with errors, likely for scientific or engineering applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (x, y, w, m, c, sigma_m, sigma_c, cov_mc, val, err, unit, scale). No external data sources or inputs are directly used in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, files, or network connections. It performs calculations and formats output strings locally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through statistical calculations and formatting functions without external or untrusted data influencing the logic directly. No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks like network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and conventional for statistical data processing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are evident.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform common statistical operations such as weighted mean, covariance, variance, linear model calculation, error propagation, and value formatting. All operations are mathematical and formatted string outputs. No network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications are observed. Usage of numpy functions is standard; no suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, intended for scientific data processing and presentation formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code is standard, clean, and functionally consistent with its purpose.",
