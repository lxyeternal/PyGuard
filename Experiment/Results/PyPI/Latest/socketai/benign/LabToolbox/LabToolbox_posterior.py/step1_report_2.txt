  "purpose": "The code performs Bayesian parameter estimation and model fitting for a user-defined function using MCMC sampling, visualizing posterior distributions and estimating parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays (x, y, sy), model function f, initial parameters p0, and uses imports from external libraries (emcee, corner, lmfit, numpy, matplotlib).",
  "sinks": "Generates plots (corner plot), prints statistical summaries, and calculates likelihoods. No data is written to external sources or files.",
  "flows": "Input data x, y, sy -> curve fitting with curve_fit -> log-probability calculation -> MCMC sampling with emcee -> posterior analysis and visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The prior only restricts parameters to positive values; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No network activity or malicious system commands present.",
  "analysis": "The script conducts a standard Bayesian fitting procedure using emcee and lmfit. It initializes parameters, performs initial curve fitting for estimates, defines a log-probability function with a simple prior, runs an MCMC sampler, and visualizes/post-processes the results. All operations are typical for statistical analysis and model fitting. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The code functions as intended for scientific data analysis. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate Bayesian parameter estimation with standard Python scientific libraries. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is a normal data fitting script with no suspicious activity.",
