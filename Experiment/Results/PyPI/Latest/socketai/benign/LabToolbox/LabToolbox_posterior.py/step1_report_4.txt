{
  "purpose": "Perform Bayesian parameter estimation using MCMC with emcee, fit a model to data, and visualize posterior distributions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays (x, y, sy), initial parameter guesses (p0), and model function (f).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data leaks or untrusted data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through model fitting, likelihood calculations, and into MCMC sampling; posterior samples are visualized and summarized.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior. Usage of standard libraries and typical Bayesian analysis procedures. The prior enforces positivity on parameters, which is common in physical models but not suspicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Bayesian parameter estimation workflow with proper initial fitting, likelihood calculation, and MCMC sampling. It includes standard plotting of posterior distributions and summaries. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no data exfiltration or malicious commands detected. The prior enforces positivity constraints which are typical in physical modeling contexts. All operations appear consistent with legitimate scientific analysis routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard Bayesian MCMC analysis for parameter estimation without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. The code is legitimate scientific code for model fitting.",
