{
  "purpose": "The code performs Bayesian parameter estimation using emcee, starting with an initial curve fit via lmfit's curve_fit. It defines a simple uniform prior restricting parameters to positive values, runs MCMC sampling, visualizes the posterior with corner, and reports medians, credible intervals, and the maximum likelihood estimates.",
  "sources": "Data arrays x, y, sy; model function f; initial parameters p0.",
  "sinks": "Posterior corner plot visualization; printed summaries of medians, credible intervals, and MLE parameters.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into initial curve fitting, then into the log-probability function during MCMC sampling; posterior samples are used for visualization and statistical summaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected. Prior enforces positivity constraints, which are standard in physical models.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Bayesian analysis routines with initial estimation, MCMC sampling, and posterior visualization. It uses common scientific libraries without malicious behavior. The prior restricts parameters to positive values, typical in physical modeling. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific routine for Bayesian parameter estimation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
