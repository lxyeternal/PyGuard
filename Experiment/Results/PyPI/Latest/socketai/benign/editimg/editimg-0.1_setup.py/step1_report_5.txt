  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'editimg' Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external output beyond setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content as long_description (source) to package metadata (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' without exception handling or context manager; no suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools to define package metadata. It reads the 'README.md' file for the long_description, which is typical. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code flows. No external network activity, code injection, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward and conforms to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script with no signs of malware or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks safely.",
