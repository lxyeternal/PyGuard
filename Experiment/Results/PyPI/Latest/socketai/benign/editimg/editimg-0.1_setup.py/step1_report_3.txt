  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'editimg' Python project",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Reads file content ('README.md') during setup for long description",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open' to read 'README.md' directly without try-except; no validation or sanitization, but this is standard for setup scripts",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. The only noteworthy operation is reading a markdown file for the long description, which is common practice. No suspicious or malicious code, no hidden data flows, no dynamic execution, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package setup code with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It primarily reads a file for descriptive purposes and sets up package metadata.",
