  "purpose": "Import the Image class from a local imagekit module, likely for image processing tasks.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .imagekit import Image",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, external input/output, or network activity present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code is a simple import with no runtime data processing",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the comment indicating the year 2025, which is in the future and likely a typo or placeholder",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward import statement with no data handling, network activity, or complex logic. The only unusual aspect is the future year in the comment, which does not impact security. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions suggest a very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The only minor concern is the future year in the comment, which should be corrected but does not pose a security threat.",
