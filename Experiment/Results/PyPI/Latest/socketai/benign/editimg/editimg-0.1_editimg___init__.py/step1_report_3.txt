  "purpose": "The code appears to define or import a module related to image processing, specifically importing 'Image' from a local module 'imagekit'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own file for its content, and possibly imports data from the 'imagekit' module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any evident sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leakage within this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows are apparent in this fragment as it only involves an import statement and a comment.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future relative to current date, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment block with licensing and copyright info, followed by an import statement for a local module. There are no active code executions, data processing, or network interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this fragment, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is a straightforward import statement with a license comment. No malware, anomalous behavior, or security concerns are evident.",
