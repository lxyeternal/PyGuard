  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable in this fragment; it only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the copyright date '2025', which is in the future relative to the current date (2023), indicating potential misstatement or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, consisting of a comment block and an import statement. There are no signs of malicious code, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The future-dated copyright could be a typo but does not imply malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or insecure practices are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement within a well-commented file. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The only notable point is the future year in the copyright, likely a typo.",
