{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple module that imports the Image class from a local package named imagekit, likely used for image processing or manipulation.",
  "sources": "The only source of data in this code is the import statement, which loads a class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; it does not process or output data beyond the import.",
  "flows": "No data flow is demonstrated in this snippet; it's purely an import statement without data processing or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code. The comment about copyright is standard, though the year 2025 is in the future relative to the training data, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a license comment and an import statement. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks, and no flow of data. The import statement is straightforward and from a local module, which is standard practice. The presence of a future copyright year is unusual but not suspicious or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import operation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard module import with no data handling or external communication.",
