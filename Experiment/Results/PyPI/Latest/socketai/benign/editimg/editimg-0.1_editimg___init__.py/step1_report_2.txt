  "purpose": "Import a class 'Image' from a local module 'imagekit' for image processing or manipulation.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.imagekit' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable as no data processing occurs in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (October 2023), indicating a potential inconsistency but not maliciousness; no suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module, which is typical for a package structure. The only notable point is the future copyright year, which may suggest an oversight or placeholder. There are no signs of malicious code such as data leakage, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated behavior. The code structure is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing a simple import operation with no malicious intent. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is unlikely to be malicious but warrants a review for correctness.",
