  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of a comment block and an import statement.\n- No data flows, input/output processing, or external communications are present.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies a simple import.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate, none present.\n- **Anomalies:** Future year noted, but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Valid; no issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no risks.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - Confidence: 1 — justified given the simplicity.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1.\n- **Anomalies:** Same future year noted.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — perhaps slightly high given the minimal code, but considering the future year anomaly, it's acceptable.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.\n  - Confidence: 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable, though the security risk score could be slightly lowered to 0, given the absence of any actual risk.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Report 3**\n- Same findings as above.\n- **Anomalies:** Future year.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Report 4**\n- Same as previous, with consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — again, possibly slightly overstated.\n  - Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Report 5**\n- Same conclusions.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — acceptable but could be 0.\n  - Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Security risk:** The only potential point is the future copyright year, which is more of an typo or placeholder than a security risk. Therefore, a security risk score of 0 or 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust securityRisk scores:** Given the lack of actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, I suggest lowering the `securityRisk` score from 0.1 to **0** across all reports for accuracy.\n- **Malware, obfuscated scores:** Correct at 0.\n- **Confidence scores:** Appropriately high given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | SecurityRisk | Confidence | Justification |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            | 1            | No issues, straightforward import, benign. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            | 0.9          | No issues, minor anomaly (future year). |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0            | 0.9          | Same as above. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            | 0.9          | Same as above. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0            | 0.9          | Same as above. |\n\n---\n\n### **Final note:**\n\nBased on this review, **the code is benign**, and the scores should reflect that. The only minor point is the future year, which is likely a typo rather than a security concern.\n\n**My overall estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.",
