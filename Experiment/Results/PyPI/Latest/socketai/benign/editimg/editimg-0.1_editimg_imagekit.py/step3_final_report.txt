  "purpose": "A Python module for image processing, including loading, creating, selecting regions, filling with colors, blending, and saving PNG images.",
  "sources": "File input via decode(), pixel data access within image_data structure, external functions decode(), encode(), save_file()",
  "sinks": "save_file() function writes image data to disk; no network or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "decode() loads image data -> manipulate pixel data in image_data -> encode() prepares data -> save_file() writes to disk",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing tasks with clear structure. It uses external PNG encoding/decoding functions assumed to be safe. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The blending function implements typical alpha compositing. External dependencies are a potential risk if compromised, but within this code, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate image processing utility with no malicious intent or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to reliance on external functions whose integrity cannot be verified here.",
