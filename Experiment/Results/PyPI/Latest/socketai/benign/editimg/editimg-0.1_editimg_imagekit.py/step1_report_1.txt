{
  "purpose": "This code provides image manipulation functions such as creating, loading, saving, selecting, and filling regions within an image, primarily for editing PNG images.",
  "sources": "Reads image file via decode(file_path, return_chunks=True) during initialization; reads image data from self.image_data in create_new_image; reads pixel values in fill() and blend_rgba().",
  "sinks": "Saves image data to disk via save_file in save() and save_as().",
  "flows": "Image data is loaded from a file (source), manipulated through fill() and create_new_image(), and then saved back to disk (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. The code structure is straightforward and typical for image processing. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles image data manipulation: loading images with decode(), creating blank images, selecting regions, filling regions with blended colors, and saving images with encode() and save_file(). The blend_rgba() function performs standard alpha blending calculations. No external or untrusted data is executed or transmitted. All operations are consistent with normal image processing functions. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard image processing module with no malicious intent. It does not contain suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The functions and logic are typical for an image editing library, and no security risks are identified.",
