  "purpose": "PNG image decoding and encoding, handling PNG chunks, CRC validation, decompression, filtering, and image data reconstruction.",
  "sources": "File input reading; PNG chunk data extraction; decompression of IDAT data.",
  "sinks": "Reconstructed image data stored in memory; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "File read -> chunk validation -> CRC check -> decompression -> filtering -> pixel data extraction -> image data output.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder filter function always returns 0; license comment with future year (2025); no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard PNG processing with proper CRC validation, decompression, and chunk handling. No suspicious behaviors, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The placeholder filter function is benign, and error handling is appropriate. The code is transparent and straightforward, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate PNG encoder/decoder with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are accurate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
