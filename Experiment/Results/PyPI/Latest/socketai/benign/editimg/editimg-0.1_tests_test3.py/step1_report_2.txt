{
  "purpose": "The code loads an image, performs multiple square selections and fills with semi-transparent colors, and then saves the modified image.",
  "sources": "Reading the image file 'tests/white.png'",
  "sinks": "Saving the image as 'tests/test3.png'",
  "flows": "Loading image -> selecting areas -> filling areas -> saving the image",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Usage appears straightforward. No network activity, system commands, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script uses the 'editimg.imagekit' library to load and manipulate an image. It performs two square selections, fills these selections with semi-transparent colors, and saves the resulting image. The operations are standard image editing steps with no signs of malicious intent. The timing around the operations is likely for performance measurement. There are no inputs from untrusted sources beyond reading a local file, and no outputs other than saving the image. No suspicious code or behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign image processing script without any malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard operations using a third-party library for image manipulation. No malware, data leakage, or sabotage indications are present.",
