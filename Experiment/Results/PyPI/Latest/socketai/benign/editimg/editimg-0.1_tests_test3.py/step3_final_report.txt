{
  "purpose": "The code loads a local image, performs two square selections, fills them with semi-transparent colors, measures execution time, and saves the output image.",
  "sources": "Reads image from 'tests/white.png', performs square selections, and writes to 'tests/test3.png'.",
  "sinks": "File system for reading and writing images; no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Image loaded -> selections made -> fills applied -> image saved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward image processing with standard library functions, no network activity, environment variable usage, or obfuscation. The timing measurement is for performance profiling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code's operations are deterministic and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard image manipulations without malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify its harmless nature, with scores reflecting minimal concern.",
