  "purpose": "This code loads an image, performs square selections and fills on it, and saves the modified image.",
  "sources": "Reading the image file 'tests/white.png' from the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Saving the processed image to 'tests/test3.png'. No other untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Image is loaded -> Square selections are made -> Fill operations are performed -> Image is saved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No suspicious network activity or obfuscation present. The image manipulation appears straightforward and legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an image processing library and loads an image from a local path. It measures execution time for selecting regions and filling them with semi-transparent colors, then saves the resulting image. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The functions used are typical for image processing tasks. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors identified. The code appears benign and intended for image editing.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard image processing script performing basic selection and fill operations. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code is safe for use.",
