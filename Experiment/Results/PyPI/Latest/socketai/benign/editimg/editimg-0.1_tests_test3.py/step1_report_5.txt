{
  "purpose": "The code loads an image, performs some square selections and fills with semi-transparent colors, then saves the modified image.",
  "sources": "Input image file 'tests/white.png'",
  "sinks": "File output 'tests/test3.png'",
  "flows": "Image file read -> image processing (selections and fills) -> image saved",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation observed. The code performs straightforward image manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a module to manipulate images, loads a specific image file, performs two square selections, fills those areas with semi-transparent colors, measures the operation duration, and saves the result. No user input, network activity, or suspicious behavior detected. The image processing appears to be standard operations. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are present. The usage pattern and functions suggest intended image editing functionality without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate image processing script performing basic operations with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
