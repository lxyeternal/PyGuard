{
  "purpose": "The code loads an image, performs square selection and fill operations on it, and then saves the modified image.",
  "sources": "The code reads an image file from 'tests/white.png'.",
  "sinks": "The code saves an image to 'tests/test3.png'.",
  "flows": "Image file is read as input; modifications are applied via selection and fill operations; resulting image is saved to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of image processing functions appears standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses a known image processing library to load an image, perform rectangular selections, fill them with semi-transparent colors, and save the modified image. The use of standard library functions and straightforward file operations suggests typical image processing tasks. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The timing measurement is likely for performance profiling, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic image editing operations without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign script for image modification.",
