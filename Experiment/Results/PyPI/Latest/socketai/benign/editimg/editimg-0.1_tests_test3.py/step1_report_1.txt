{
  "purpose": "The code loads an image, performs two square selections and fills them with semi-transparent colors, then saves the modified image.",
  "sources": "Reading the image file 'tests/white.png'",
  "sinks": "Saving the modified image to 'tests/test3.png'",
  "flows": "Image file is read as input, image manipulations occur in memory, final image is written to disk",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious file paths, no unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports an image processing library and performs basic image editing operations: selecting regions and filling them with colors. The image is loaded from a local file, manipulated in memory, and saved back locally. No user input, network activity, or environment variables are used. No embedded or suspicious code segments, no obfuscated or malicious patterns, and no suspicious external calls or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard image manipulation tasks without any malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks identified. It appears to be a benign image processing script.",
