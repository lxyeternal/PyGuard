{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple module that exposes the AITutor class for interacting with AI Tutors via a REST API.",
  "sources": "Importing AITutor from ai_tutors.client, which could involve reading external code or data if the module executes code on import.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as no data is being written or transmitted directly in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is visible in this code snippet; it primarily sets up an export.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module that imports a class from a submodule and exposes it through __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The only potential concern is the import of an external class, which depends on the implementation of ai_tutors.client. However, within this snippet, no malicious or risky operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves as an interface for the AITutor class. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks within this limited snippet.",
