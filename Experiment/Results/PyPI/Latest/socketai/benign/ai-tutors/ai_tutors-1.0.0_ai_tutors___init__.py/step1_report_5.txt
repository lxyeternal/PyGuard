{
  "purpose": "The code defines a module for interacting with AI Tutors via a REST API, providing a single class export.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ai_tutors.client, which may load external code or dependencies; no other input data sources.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data output, network calls, or untrusted data handling visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible as the code is minimal and only imports and exports a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a class 'AITutor' from an external package 'ai_tutors.client' and exposes it via __all__. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues within this snippet. The presence of an import from an external package indicates dependency reliance but not malicious intent. No data handling, network communication, or sensitive operations are performed here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, benign module that sets up a library interface for AI Tutors. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a standard, safe code fragment.",
