  "purpose": "This code provides an interface to the AI Tutors REST API by exposing the AITutor class for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports the AITutor class from the ai_tutors.client module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; it does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only imports and exports a class definition.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a module, sets __all__, and provides a brief description. No input/output handling, no network calls, and no sensitive data manipulation are present. The simplicity indicates it is likely a small part of a larger package. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code are detected within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module that exposes the AITutor class for external use. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
