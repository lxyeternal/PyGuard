  "purpose": "A minimal Python module exposing the AITutor class from the ai_tutors.client package for external use.",
  "sources": "Import of AITutor from ai_tutors.client",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or network operations present",
  "flows": "Import of AITutor (source) without any further data flow or processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export, no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple interface module that imports a class from an external package and exposes it via __all__. No input/output, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The external dependency could pose a risk if malicious, but within this snippet, no malicious activity is evident. The code is clear, minimal, and follows standard practices. The scores from the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (around 0.1) mainly due to dependency reliance. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and safe. The dependency on ai_tutors.client does not introduce any malicious activity within this snippet. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
