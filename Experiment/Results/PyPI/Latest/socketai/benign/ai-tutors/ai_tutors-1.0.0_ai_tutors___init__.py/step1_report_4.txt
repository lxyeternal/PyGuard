  "purpose": "Provide an interface for interacting with AI Tutors via a REST API by exposing the AITutor class.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing AITutor from ai_tutors.client.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or data leaks visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present; the code simply exposes a class for external use.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a class and defines what to export. No dynamic code execution, no data handling, and no security-sensitive operations are visible. It appears to be a simple public API interface with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serves as a module export, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
