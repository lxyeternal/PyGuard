{
  "purpose": "The code defines an interface for interacting with AI Tutors via a REST API by importing a client class and specifying exports.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing AITutor from ai_tutors.client",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; code simply imports and exports a class",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports a class 'AITutor' from a module 'ai_tutors.client' and sets the module's export to include 'AITutor'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, code injection, or suspicious network activity. No sensitive information, credentials, or obfuscated code present. The simplicity of this snippet suggests it is a standard interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a basic module setup for a package, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as an entry point for the 'AITutor' class for external use.",
