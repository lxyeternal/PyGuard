  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'ai_tutors' library.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file with error handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data flows; static metadata passed to setup().",
  "flows": "File reading operation to variable; static data passed to setup() without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools, reading a local README file with error handling, and passing static package metadata to the setup() function. It contains no external network calls, dynamic code execution, or untrusted data sources. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic. The error handling for the README file is appropriate. All signals indicate benign, standard behavior for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free from malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and justified based on the analysis.",
