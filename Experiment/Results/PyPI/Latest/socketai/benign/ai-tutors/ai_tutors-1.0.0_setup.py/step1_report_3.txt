{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'ai_tutors' Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file from a specific path to include as long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is being processed into critical system functions or external commands.",
  "flows": "Reads README content from file; no untrusted input flows into other parts of code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The try-except handles missing README gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to configure package installation. It reads a local README file with error handling, then specifies package info, dependencies, author, and classifiers. No user input, environment variables, or external data influences the setup beyond reading a local file. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
