  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the ai_tutors Python package, including reading the README file and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file from the 'ai_tutors' directory.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data is used in a harmful way or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Reading file content (source) is stored in a variable but not used maliciously; no flow to external systems or sensitive data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The use of standard setup tools and straightforward file handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads the README.md file, with error handling for missing files, then proceeds to call setup() with package metadata and requirements. All operations are standard and intended for package distribution, with no indication of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply reads a README file and configures package metadata for distribution.",
