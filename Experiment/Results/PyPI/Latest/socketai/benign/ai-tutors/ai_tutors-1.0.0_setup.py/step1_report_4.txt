  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'ai_tutors' Python package, used to package and distribute the library.",
  "sources": "Reads a README.md file from a specified directory; uses hardcoded package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data outputs or network connections.",
  "flows": "Reads file content for long_description; uses static metadata for setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns; exception handling for README file is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, importing standard libraries, reading a README file with error handling, and calling setup() with package metadata. No external inputs or untrusted data are processed or transmitted. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or supply chain threats are detected. The code appears to be straightforward and conventional for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies detected. It performs package configuration tasks without any signs of malware or security issues.",
