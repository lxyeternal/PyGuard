{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'ai_tutors' Python package for distribution, including reading the README file and specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file from the 'ai_tutors' directory; importing 'os' and 'setuptools' modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data outputs or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file as input, then passing static package information to 'setup()' without any data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior; the only dynamic operation is reading a local file with error handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a local README file with error handling, and calls 'setup()' with static package metadata. All operations are standard for package setup scripts. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution based on untrusted input, and no suspicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads a local README file and configures package metadata without any suspicious or malicious activity. The code appears benign and appropriate for its purpose.",
