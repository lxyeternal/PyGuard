{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'ai_tutors' Python package including reading a README file and specifying package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file from the 'ai_tutors' directory to obtain long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only reads a file and sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads file content, then passes static data into the setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads the README file, handles potential file not found errors gracefully, and supplies static metadata (name, version, author, dependencies, classifiers) to the setup() function. There are no dynamic code executions, external data inputs other than reading a local file, or any suspicious logic. No indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. It securely handles file reading and uses standard package metadata without any suspicious modifications.",
