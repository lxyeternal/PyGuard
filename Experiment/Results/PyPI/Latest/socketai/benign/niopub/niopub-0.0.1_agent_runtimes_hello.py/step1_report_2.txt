{
  "purpose": "A simple asynchronous script that repeatedly outputs provided form data in JSON format, with options to display help information.",
  "sources": "Reads input JSON string from command line argument",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON data to standard output; potential termination signals",
  "flows": "Command line input -> json.loads parsing -> stored in form_data -> printed repeatedly in run() method",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials or hidden functionalities; no external network activity",
  "analysis": "The code primarily processes user-supplied JSON data from command-line arguments, outputs it repeatedly every second, and handles termination signals. It includes a help option that displays static form field definitions. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. Usage is straightforward, and there are no complex or obfuscated parts. The code's operations are limited to input parsing, printing, and signal handling, with no external network or file system manipulations beyond standard input/output.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a simple data display loop with basic input validation and help support.",
