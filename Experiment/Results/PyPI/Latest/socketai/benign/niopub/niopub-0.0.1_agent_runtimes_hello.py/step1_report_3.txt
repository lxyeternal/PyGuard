{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a simple asynchronous program that prints provided form data repeatedly until terminated.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line argument as JSON string, which is parsed into form_data.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON-formatted data to standard output; no external network or file access observed.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (JSON string) -> parsed into form_data -> used in async print loop -> output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Signal handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily processes user input via command-line argument, parses JSON data, and repeatedly prints it asynchronously. It sets up signal handlers for graceful termination. No suspicious external calls, network activity, or code obfuscation detected. Usage of JSON for input/output is straightforward and safe in this context. Overall, the code is simple, with no malicious intent or security risks apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign script that outputs user-provided JSON data repeatedly. No malicious behavior or security threats are evident.",
