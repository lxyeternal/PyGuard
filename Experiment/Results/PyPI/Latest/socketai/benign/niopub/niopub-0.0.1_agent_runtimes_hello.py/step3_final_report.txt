  "purpose": "A simple utility that accepts JSON input via command-line, parses it, and repeatedly outputs it, with support for help and graceful termination.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument input, json.loads parsing",
  "sinks": "Console output (print), signal handling for termination",
  "flows": "Input JSON -> parse -> store in form_data -> print repeatedly in async loop",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity; straightforward logic",
  "analysis": "The code accepts user-provided JSON via command-line, parses it safely, and outputs it periodically. It includes signal handlers for graceful shutdown. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. The only potential issue is resource exhaustion if large or malformed JSON is provided, but this is not malicious, just a resource concern. The code structure is simple, clear, and secure. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
