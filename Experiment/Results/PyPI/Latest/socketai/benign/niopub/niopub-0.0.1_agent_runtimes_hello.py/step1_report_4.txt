{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to repeatedly output provided form data in JSON format until interrupted, and to display help information about form fields.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from command-line arguments, specifically the second argument which is expected to be a JSON string.",
  "sinks": "The JSON input is parsed without sanitization, but no untrusted data flows into security-sensitive operations. The form data is only printed in JSON format; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The command-line argument (form_data) is parsed via json.loads(), then stored in an object, which is repeatedly printed in the run() method. There are no data flows from untrusted sources into critical sinks beyond this input parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Signal handling is standard, and JSON processing is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts a JSON string as input and prints it repeatedly every second. It also supports displaying help data. No dangerous data flows or malicious behavior detected. The code relies on user-provided input, but it is only parsed and printed without manipulation or network operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for displaying form data repeatedly and providing help info. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks are present. The overall security risk score is very low.",
