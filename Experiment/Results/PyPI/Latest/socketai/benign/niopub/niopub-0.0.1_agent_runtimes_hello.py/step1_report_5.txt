{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to continuously print JSON-formatted form data received via command-line argument, and provide help information about form fields when invoked with --help.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from command-line arguments, specifically sys.argv[1], which is expected to be a JSON string representing form data.",
  "sinks": "The form data is printed out as JSON in the asyncio loop, which is a benign sink unless the printed data contains sensitive information that might be exposed in logs or console output.",
  "flows": "Input JSON from command-line argument flows into the json.loads() function; then, the data is stored in 'form_data' and repeatedly output via print in an async loop.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs straightforward input parsing, help message display, and a loop printing data. No suspicious dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script processes command-line input to parse JSON data, which is then repeatedly printed in an infinite loop unless interrupted. It includes standard signal handling for termination signals. The help message provides predefined form field descriptions. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. It functions as a simple form data display utility with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware in this code. It appears to be a benign utility for displaying form data and help information. The code structure and content suggest low security risk and no malicious activity.",
