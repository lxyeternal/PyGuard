  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured async agent with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score of 0.2 reflects minimal concerns related to external API reliance and environment variable handling, which are standard practices. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for deployment."
