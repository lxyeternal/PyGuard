  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, using static variables and type hints.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and tuples; no external input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assignments without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, auto-generated version info code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static version info module with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or obfuscation. It employs common patterns like TYPE_CHECKING for type hints. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. All signals indicate benign, auto-generated boilerplate code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify it as a standard version info module. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with high confidence.",
