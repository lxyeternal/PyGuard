  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a standard auto-generated version info module for a Python package.\n- It defines version variables (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`) with static values.\n- Uses a `TYPE_CHECKING` conditional for type hints, which is common practice.\n- No dynamic code, user input, external data, or network activity.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code is benign and standard**; no malicious or suspicious code detected.\n- **No data flow from untrusted sources**.\n- **No anomalies or irregular patterns**.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The report is accurate: the code is straightforward, static, and typical for version management.\n- No errors or flaws are present in the code logic or reasoning.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0.0`, which is correct.\n- `securityRisk: 0.0` is also appropriate.\n- `obfuscated: 0.0` is correct.\n- The confidence scores are 1.0, justified given the clear, standard nature of the code.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the analysis is sound.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code is auto-generated by `setuptools-scm`, a standard tool.\n- No signs of tampering or malicious modifications.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical, benign version info module with no security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
