  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple)",
  "sinks": "None that directly process untrusted data; purely static variable assignments",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no input/output data flows or external data sources",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING conditional; no suspicious dynamic code, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets present",
  "analysis": "The code defines version metadata variables for a package, generated automatically. It uses standard Python idioms and type hints. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are involved. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code is static and straightforward, serving purely for package versioning purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated version declaration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
