  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the claims.\n\n**General observations about the code:**\n- The code is a standard auto-generated version module, typically created by setuptools-scm.\n- It employs common Python idioms, such as conditional type checking with `TYPE_CHECKING`.\n- All version variables are statically assigned, with no dynamic data, external inputs, or outputs.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code's purpose is purely to define and export version information.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Claim:** Benign, standard version info setup, no malicious intent.\n- **Score:** malware = 0.0, securityRisk = 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Claim:** Straightforward version definition, no data leaks or untrusted data handling.\n- **Score:** malware = 0.0, securityRisk = 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Claim:** Simple static versioning code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Score:** malware = 0.0, securityRisk = 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Claim:** Standard boilerplate code, no indicators of tampering.\n- **Score:** malware = 0.0, securityRisk = 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Claim:** Auto-generated, benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** malware = 0.0, securityRisk = 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, static, and standard.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None. The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** All are set to 0.0 for malware and security risk, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None are claimed or implied beyond the benign description.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a typical, auto-generated version info module with no malicious or suspicious features.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis code is benign and poses no security threat.",
