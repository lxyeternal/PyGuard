  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '__version__' and version tuple '__version_tuple__'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; version variables are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING with conditional type imports is standard; no anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward version definition file with no dynamic or untrusted data input. It includes type checking conditionals and static assignment of version strings and tuples. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version information module with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
