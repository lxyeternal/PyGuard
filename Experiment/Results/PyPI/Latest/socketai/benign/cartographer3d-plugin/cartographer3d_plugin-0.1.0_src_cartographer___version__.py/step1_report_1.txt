  "purpose": "Define and export version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, imports within TYPE_CHECKING conditional.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external inputs or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of version variables; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING block is standard; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables for package identification, employing conditional type checking. All operations are static assignments with no data input or external interactions. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The code is typical for package versioning and contains no obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version info setup for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
