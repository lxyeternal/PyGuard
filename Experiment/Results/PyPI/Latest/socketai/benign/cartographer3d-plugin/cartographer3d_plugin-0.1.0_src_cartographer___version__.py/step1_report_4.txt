  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm",
  "sources": "Assignment statements for version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external interactions",
  "flows": "None, as variables are assigned static version info",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded version string is standard for package versioning",
  "analysis": "The code declares version-related variables for a Python package, including __version__, version, __version_tuple__, and version_tuple. It uses standard static assignment with hardcoded version strings and tuples. The use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints is typical and does not involve runtime code execution or external data. There are no inputs, no dynamic execution, no external data sources, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a straightforward version declaration for a package, with no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks. It is standard boilerplate code generated by setuptools-scm, with no indicators of tampering or malicious intent.",
