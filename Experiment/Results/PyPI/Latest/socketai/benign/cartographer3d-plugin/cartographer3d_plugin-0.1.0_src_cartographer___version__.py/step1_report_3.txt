  "purpose": "Define and assign version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, static variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or output operations.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string to variables, static data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward versioning module, with static version information assigned directly to variables. The use of TYPE_CHECKING conditional is standard for type hinting purposes and does not involve runtime data handling or external inputs. There are no suspicious patterns, no code injection, or malicious behavior. The code is typical of auto-generated version files, with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign version definition module, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
