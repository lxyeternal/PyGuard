{
  "purpose": "The code implements a generic stream processing and session management framework with callback support, designed for handling data items in a controlled manner.",
  "sources": "Input data originates from external sources via the add_item() method of the Stream class.",
  "sinks": "Callbacks registered through register_callback() are invoked with each new item, potentially exposing data or executing external code.",
  "flows": "Items added via add_item() are optionally smoothed, then dispatched to active sessions' add_item() methods and callbacks; sessions monitor conditions and store items accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code present. Use of Protocol and ABC suggests design flexibility rather than malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines interfaces for condition variables and stream sessions, allowing for concurrent and conditional data collection. Sessions can be started and stopped; items are added with optional smoothing. Callbacks are registered for real-time processing. The logic appears straightforward and focused on data flow management. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. The code's purpose aligns with standard stream and session handling.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a benign framework for managing data streams with sessions and callbacks. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions as a flexible, well-structured data processing utility.",
