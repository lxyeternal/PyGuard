  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, considering the code, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a generic, flexible data streaming framework with sessions, conditions, and callbacks.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious payloads is found.\n- The code relies heavily on user-defined functions (conditions, callbacks), which could pose risks if malicious, but this is typical and not inherently malicious.\n- The malware score assigned is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the potential for misuse via user-defined callbacks but no active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Flaws:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are detected in the code itself; all reports confirm this.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No technical errors or logical flaws are identified in the code. The reasoning in the reports is consistent and sound.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score (0):** Justified; no malicious activity or payload detected.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Correct; code is clear, using standard Python features.\n- **Security risk (0.1–0.2):** Slightly higher than zero due to potential misuse of user-defined callbacks or conditions, but not indicative of active threats.\n\n### Potential Risks and Assumptions:\n\n- The main risk stems from user-supplied functions (`start_condition`, callbacks), which could be malicious if supplied by an attacker. However, this is inherent in callback-based systems and does not reflect a vulnerability in the code itself.\n- No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are present.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n\n- The scores across reports are consistent with the analysis.\n- The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are slightly higher, reflecting the potential for misuse, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and standard)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (due to potential misuse via user-defined functions, but no active threats)\n\n**Justification:**\n\n- The code itself is benign.\n- The potential for misuse exists but is typical for callback systems and not specific to malicious intent.\n- No evidence supports higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and justified. The code is a well-structured, benign data streaming framework with no malicious or obfuscated components. The low security risk reflects the potential for misuse but does not indicate an active threat.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No malicious activity detected                             |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | Code is clear, uses standard Python features             |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1–0.2           | Potential misuse via user-defined functions, but not malicious |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and does not pose a security threat in its current form. The minor risk scores are appropriate, reflecting typical concerns with callback-based designs.",
