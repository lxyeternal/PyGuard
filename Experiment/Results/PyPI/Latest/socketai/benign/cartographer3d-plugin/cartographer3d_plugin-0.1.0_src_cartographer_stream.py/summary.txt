  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-designed data streaming framework with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the potential misuse of user-defined callbacks, which is inherent to callback-based systems but not indicative of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's nature."
