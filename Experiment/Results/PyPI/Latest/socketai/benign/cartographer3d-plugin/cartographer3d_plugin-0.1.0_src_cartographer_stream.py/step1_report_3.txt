{
  "purpose": "This code defines generic classes for managing streams and sessions with conditions and callbacks, likely for real-time data processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the add_item method of the Stream class.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can be passed to callback functions registered via register_callback; session items could be accessed or leaked if callbacks mishandle data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from add_item into sessions via add_item and then possibly into callbacks. Callbacks can process or leak data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of protocols and abstract base classes is standard. No obfuscation, malicious network activity, or data theft routines detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a generic stream and session management system with condition-based data collection. It uses standard Python typing and abstract classes, with no signs of malicious behavior. The main input source is through add_item, which passes data to sessions and callbacks. Callbacks could potentially leak data if malicious, but this is user-controlled, not embedded malicious code. No network activity, file manipulation, or obfuscated code present. The overall design appears to be a benign data collection framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data stream and session management framework. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. The structure is consistent with legitimate data processing logic.",
