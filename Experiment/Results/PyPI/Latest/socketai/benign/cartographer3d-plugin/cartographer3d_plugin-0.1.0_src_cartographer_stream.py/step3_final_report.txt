{
  "purpose": "A generic, thread-safe data streaming framework with sessions, conditions, and callbacks, designed for flexible data processing.",
  "sources": "Input data items added via add_item method, user-defined start_condition, callback functions, and condition functions.",
  "sinks": "Callback functions may process or leak data; no direct data exfiltration or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Data items flow from add_item through optional smoothing, then to active sessions' add_item, and to registered callbacks; user-defined conditions control session start and waiting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard Python features, no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, generic streaming framework with session management, conditions, and callbacks. It uses standard Python practices, with no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The main potential security concern is the use of user-defined functions (conditions and callbacks), which could be malicious if supplied externally. However, this is typical in such frameworks and not an inherent flaw. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The malware score is appropriately 0, as no malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscated score is 0, given code clarity. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the potential misuse of callbacks but not active malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-designed data streaming framework with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the potential misuse of user-defined callbacks, which is inherent to callback-based systems but not indicative of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
