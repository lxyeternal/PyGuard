{
  "purpose": "The code implements a generic streaming and session management framework with conditions and callbacks, likely for processing streamed data.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are abstracted as items added via the add_item method in the Stream class.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include callback functions registered via register_callback, which receive each item. Items can be processed or transmitted by these callbacks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external sources into the add_item method, optionally smoothed, then into active sessions via session.add_item, and finally into callback functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of type hints and abstract classes is standard. No external network activity or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a thread-safe, generic streaming framework with session management, conditions, and callbacks. It uses standard Python features and patterns, such as context managers and protocols. No external data leaks, malicious data handling, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The data flows are well-contained within the application logic, with no evident malicious side effects or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign, well-structured streaming and session management framework. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It functions as an abstract data processing component with no malicious payload or suspicious behavior.",
