{
  "purpose": "Implement a generic streaming and session management framework with conditions and callbacks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the add_item method and start_condition functions.",
  "sinks": "Callbacks registered via register_callback could process untrusted data; start_condition functions could contain malicious logic if user-supplied.",
  "flows": "Data flows from add_item through optional smoothing, into sessions (via add_item), and into callbacks; start_condition functions influence session start.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; use of Protocol and ABC suggests standard design; start_condition can be user-defined, but no malicious intent is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a structured system for managing data streams and sessions, with flexible conditions and callback mechanisms. No suspicious network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration points are present. The use of user-defined conditions and callbacks could theoretically be misused if external inputs are malicious, but this is typical in callback-based architectures. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The logic is straightforward and adheres to common patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured streaming and session management framework without malicious intent. No malware or malicious behavior detected. The main risk lies in the external functions (conditions, callbacks) which are user-defined, but that does not constitute malicious code within this module itself.",
