  "purpose": "Configure a logger with a specific formatter and a null handler for logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'logging' module; creating a logger instance; defining a formatter; creating and setting a NullHandler.",
  "targets": "The logger object, which may be used elsewhere in the code to log messages.",
  "flows": "Logger creation -> formatter setup -> NullHandler creation -> handler setup -> addHandler to logger",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The use of NullHandler indicates intention to suppress logging output, which is a common practice.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger for the current module with a specific message format. It sets up a NullHandler to prevent 'No handlers could be found for logger' warnings, a common pattern for library code that does not handle logging itself. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and standard for logging setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging configuration snippet, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
