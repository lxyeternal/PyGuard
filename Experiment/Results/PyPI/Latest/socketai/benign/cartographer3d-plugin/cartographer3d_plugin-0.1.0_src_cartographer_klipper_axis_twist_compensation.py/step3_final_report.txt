  "purpose": "Manage axis twist compensation calibration data via configuration read/write operations.",
  "sources": "Configuration sections, calibration parameters, input values for compensation, start/end floats, and calibration flags.",
  "sinks": "Configuration files where calibration data and parameters are written, specifically via configfile.set() calls.",
  "flows": "Input data (values, start, end) flow from function parameters into configuration storage through set() calls; calibration flags influence calibration options returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward data handling; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard helper class for managing calibration data, reading from configuration objects and writing updates back to configuration files. It formats floating-point values for storage, updates internal calibration state, and retrieves calibration options. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The data flow is typical for configuration management, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misconfiguration if untrusted data is supplied, but this is inherent to configuration code and not indicative of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard configuration management tasks without malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal operational risk. No modifications are necessary; the code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
