{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate and store release metadata, including Git information and project details, during a build process.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'GITHUB_REF_NAME' and 'GITHUB_REPOSITORY'; function calls to retrieve_git_version and get_commit_sha; file system for writing 'release_info'.",
  "sinks": "Writing JSON data to 'release_info' file; no untrusted data is directly written to external systems or executed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to customize URLs, then collected data is assembled into JSON and written to a file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present. No indirect data leaks or malicious data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The script fetches environment variables related to GitHub, retrieves Git info via subprocess calls, and writes this info to a file. All subprocess commands are standard Git commands and their outputs are stored locally. No external data is sent over the network or stored outside the filesystem. The code adheres to typical build metadata generation patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform legitimate build metadata collection without any malicious intent. It relies on environment variables and system commands to generate release info. No security risks or malware indications are detected.",
