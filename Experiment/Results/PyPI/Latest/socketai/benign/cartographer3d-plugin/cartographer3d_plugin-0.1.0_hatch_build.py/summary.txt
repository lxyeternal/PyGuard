  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign build hook for collecting release metadata. No evidence of malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation. The slight risk associated with environment variable handling is acceptable within typical CI/CD contexts. The overall security posture is very low, and the code can be considered safe."
