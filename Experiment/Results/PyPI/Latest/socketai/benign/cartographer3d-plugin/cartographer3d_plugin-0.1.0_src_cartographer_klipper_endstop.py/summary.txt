  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured hardware interface for homing and endstop management in a 3D printer or CNC context. It poses minimal security risk, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
