  "purpose": "Define a protocol for executing tasks via a callable function with parameter specifications.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; code imports typing and typing_extensions modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only defines a protocol with a method signature.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing modules and defines a Protocol class 'TaskExecutor' with a 'run' method that accepts a callable with specified parameters. It uses ParamSpec to type hint the function parameters and TypeVar for the return type. The code is straightforward and standard for defining interfaces. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious imports, or malicious logic. No external data handling, no code injection, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type hinting and interface definition with no malicious or suspicious activity. It is safe and appears to serve as an interface for task execution within a larger system.",
