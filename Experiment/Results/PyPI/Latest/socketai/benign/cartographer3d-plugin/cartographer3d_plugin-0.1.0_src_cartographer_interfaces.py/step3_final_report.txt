  "purpose": "Define a type-safe interface for executing tasks with flexible arguments and return types using Python's typing system.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code is purely type annotations and interface declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines a protocol with a method signature.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, using standard typing constructs without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple interface definition using Python's typing system, importing necessary modules, defining type variables, and declaring a Protocol with a method 'run' that accepts a callable with flexible parameters via ParamSpec and returns a generic type R. There are no runtime behaviors, data processing, external communications, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The high confidence score (1) reflects the straightforward and well-understood nature of the code, and no anomalies or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
