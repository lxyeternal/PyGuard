      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign build hook for collecting release metadata. No evidence of malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation. The slight risk associated with environment variable handling is acceptable within typical CI/CD contexts. The overall security posture is very low, and the code can be considered safe."

The primary security consideration is the potential misuse of user-defined callbacks, which is inherent to callback-based systems but not indicative of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's nature."

It poses minimal security risk, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."

The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal operational risk. No modifications are necessary; the code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose."

No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's content, except for an overestimation of risk in one report which should be lowered to reflect the actual low threat level."
