{
  "purpose": "Define interfaces and data structures for 3D printer homing, probing, and movement control.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; mainly method signatures and property getters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could leak data; no network, file, or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions; all methods are interface definitions without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected. Use of Protocols and type hints is standard for interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type-annotated interface definitions for components involved in homing, probing, and movement of a device (likely a 3D printer or CNC). It uses Protocols, TypeVars, and data classes to formalize the expected behaviors and data structures. There are no executable statements, network calls, file operations, or data processing logic that could be malicious. The code appears to be a well-structured set of interface definitions with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a collection of interface definitions and data structures for device control, with no evidence of malicious behavior. It does not perform any operations, data transmission, or file access, making it safe and standard for its purpose.",
