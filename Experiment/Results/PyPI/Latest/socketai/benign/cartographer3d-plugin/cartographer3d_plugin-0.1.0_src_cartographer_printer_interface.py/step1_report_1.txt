{
  "purpose": "This code defines various interfaces and data structures related to 3D printer or CNC machine control, including homing, positioning, temperature management, and macros.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from TYPE_CHECKING, positional and configuration data, and parameters for homing, probing, and movement functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data, no network or file output, no command execution, no system calls or external data transmissions.",
  "flows": "Data flows mainly within the protocol method definitions and class attributes, but no concrete data flow or untrusted input processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, such as obfuscated logic, hidden code, or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or credentials identified. Code primarily consists of interface definitions and type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains protocol definitions and data structures for machine control. No executable logic, external data handling, or command execution is present. It does not process untrusted input directly; instead, it defines interfaces to be implemented elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be part of a larger, well-structured control system, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of interface and data structure definitions for a machine control system. It does not contain executable logic, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. There are no indicators of malicious activity or sabotage within this code segment.",
