{
  "purpose": "Define interfaces and data structures for 3D printer or CNC machine control, including homing, positioning, and sensor interactions.",
  "sources": "None; code primarily defines protocols and data classes without input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent to external systems or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no execution flow or data flow from source to sink present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard Python features, type annotations, and protocols for defining interfaces. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple interface and data class definitions relevant to machine control systems. It includes protocols for position, homing, endstops, temperature, and toolhead control. No code executes untrusted data processing, network communication, or file operations. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are observed. The overall structure appears to be part of a larger control system framework, with no malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of interface definitions for a machine control application, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions solely to define protocols and data structures without executing any risky operations.",
