{
  "purpose": "Defines interfaces and data structures for hardware control in 3D printers or CNC machines, including positions, homing, probing, temperature, and toolhead management.",
  "sources": "Class and protocol method signatures, data class attributes, type annotations; no runtime data processing or external input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not read untrusted data, send data externally, or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares interfaces without implementation or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of interface definitions, data classes, and protocols for hardware control. It lacks executable logic, data handling from untrusted sources, or external communication. The structure is standard and clean, indicating a framework rather than an active component. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, structural framework for hardware control interfaces with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a foundation for implementation elsewhere, and based solely on this snippet, there are no security concerns.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
