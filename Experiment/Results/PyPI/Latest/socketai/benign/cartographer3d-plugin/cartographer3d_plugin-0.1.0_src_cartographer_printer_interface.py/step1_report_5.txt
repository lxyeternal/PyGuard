{
  "purpose": "This code defines various protocols, data structures, and interfaces for controlling a 3D printer or CNC machine, including homing, probing, temperature, and movement operations.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of untrusted data; code relies on method parameters and type annotations. No input reading or external data sourcing functions are present.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or harmful effects; no network communication, file writing, or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code mainly consists of interface definitions and method signatures without implementations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a structured set of interface definitions with no embedded executable logic, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of protocol and data class definitions for a 3D printer or CNC control system. It includes type annotations, method signatures, and interface protocols for homing, probing, temperature management, and movement. There are no implementation details, external data handling, or executable logic that could pose security risks. The code does not process untrusted data directly, nor does it perform any network or file operations. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or hidden code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of interface definitions and data structures with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be part of a larger system where implementations could contain risks, but this module alone is benign.",
