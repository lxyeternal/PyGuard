{
  "purpose": "Define various protocols, data classes, and type variables for a 3D printer or CNC machine control system, including homing, position, temperature, toolhead, and macro operations.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data through function parameters, type annotations, and properties such as endstop triggers, position, temperature, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; code primarily defines interfaces and data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve querying sensors (endstop status, temperature), manipulating positions, and controlling hardware via method calls. No external untrusted data sources or network calls are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated language features, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code strictly defines interfaces and data classes without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type definitions, protocol classes, data classes, and type variables intended for hardware control of a 3D printer or CNC. It includes no dynamic code execution, network communication, or data exfiltration logic. The interfaces appear to be well-structured and purpose-specific, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation methods are present. The code mainly establishes a framework for hardware control and data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of interface and data structure definitions for a machine control system. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
