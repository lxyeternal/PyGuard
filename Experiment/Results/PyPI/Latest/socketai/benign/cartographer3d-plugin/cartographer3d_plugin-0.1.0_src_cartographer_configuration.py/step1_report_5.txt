{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and protocols for a cartographer configuration system, including scan and touch models.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; the code defines data models and protocol interfaces.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is being sent or written in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present; this code only defines structures and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard Python features for data modeling and protocol definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes data classes and protocols for a cartographer system, including enums, dataclasses, and type protocols with method signatures. There are no data processing, input handling, network operations, or file I/O present. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware indicators are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured configuration module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, structural definition module with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as an interface and data model layer for a cartography system without any harmful or suspicious operations.",
