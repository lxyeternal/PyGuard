{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and protocols for a cartographer and bed mesh configuration system, likely for a scanning or probing device.",
  "sources": "There are no explicit sources of untrusted input data in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or output points where untrusted data could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows in this code; it mainly defines interfaces and data models.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behaviors are present. All code is standard for defining data structures and protocols.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of class and protocol definitions using Python typing and dataclasses, with no runtime logic, input handling, or external calls. No malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors are observable. The code does not perform any I/O, network operations, or data manipulation beyond data structure definitions. It appears to be a module providing structured configuration and model interfaces.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this code. It serves as a foundation for configuration management in a larger system, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
