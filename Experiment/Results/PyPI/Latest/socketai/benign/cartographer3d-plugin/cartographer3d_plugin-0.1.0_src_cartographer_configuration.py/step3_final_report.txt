{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures, enums, and protocols for configuration and modeling in a cartographer/scanning system, serving as interface/schema components.",
  "sources": "Class and method definitions, including class attributes and placeholder methods for saving models.",
  "sinks": "No external data input/output, network communication, or data processing present; purely structural definitions.",
  "flows": "None; no runtime data flow or external data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data classes, enums, and protocols defining configuration schemas. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or network operations. The methods are placeholders, indicating interface definitions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign, structural nature of the code. The low security risk scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of data models and interfaces with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate given the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
