{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures and protocols related to a cartography or scanning system, including configuration classes, models, and methods for saving models.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; data is structured through class attributes and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data transmission points are present; methods are placeholders without implementation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters (e.g., 'name', 'model', 'speed', 'threshold') to protocol-defined methods, but no actual data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be purely structural with type hints and protocol definitions; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class and protocol definitions with no executable logic or data processing. No input/output operations, network access, or file handling are present. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are detectable. The placeholders suggest that actual implementations are elsewhere. The code's structure indicates it is part of a larger system, but on its own, it shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of data class and protocol definitions for a cartography/scanning system. No malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident in this fragment.",
