{
  "purpose": "Calculate the area of geometric figures such as circles and triangles based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters via **kwargs in the constructor, such as 'r' for radius, and 'a', 'b', 'c' for triangle sides.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not send data externally or execute untrusted input beyond basic math operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are provided during object instantiation and used within the calc_area method for computations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard math functions and simple control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for calculating areas of specific figures with input validation and error handling. It does not perform any network communication, file operations, or system modifications. The math operations are straightforward and safe. No suspicious or malicious logic, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation for calculating areas of circles and triangles with proper error handling. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
