  "purpose": "Calculate the area of geometric figures (circle and triangle) based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters via **kwargs (radius, sides a, b, c). No external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no output other than printed messages or returned values.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed directly within functions; no external data flow or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code only performs mathematical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to compute areas for circles and triangles with basic validation. It uses input parameters for calculations, handling missing data with print statements. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious side effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for geometric calculations with proper handling of input errors. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code fragment.",
