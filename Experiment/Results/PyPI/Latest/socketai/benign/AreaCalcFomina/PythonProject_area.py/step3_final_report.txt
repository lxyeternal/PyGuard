  "purpose": "Calculate the area of geometric figures (circle and triangle) based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters via **kwargs for figure dimensions (radius, sides).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows to external systems or causes security effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in calculations; no external data flow or untrusted source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for error handling instead of raising exceptions; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for calculating areas of circles and triangles with straightforward logic. Error handling via print statements is unconventional but not malicious. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration present. The code is simple, clear, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's operations are standard mathematical calculations with proper input validation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for geometric calculations with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current security assessment scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
