  "purpose": "Calculate the area of geometric figures (circle, triangle) based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters via **kwargs in the constructor and figure_type attribute.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data from constructor to calc_area method; no external flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The class provides methods for calculating areas of a circle and triangle with basic mathematical operations. It uses standard Python libraries and performs input validation through try-except blocks. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors. The code performs straightforward calculations without external side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, legitimate utility for calculating areas of specific figures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
