  "purpose": "Calculate the area of geometric figures (circle and triangle) based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: figure_type, r (radius), a, b, c (triangle sides) in kwargs.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are read in the constructor and used in calc_area method to compute area based on figure_type.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code patterns. Error messages are printed, but that is typical for input validation. No external network, file operations, or dangerous dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Area class with an __init__ method that stores figure type and parameters. The calc_area method computes the area for circles and triangles, handling missing data with print statements. No use of external or unsafe functions, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors observed. It uses math functions appropriately, and error handling is limited to input validation messages. No malicious behavior or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward geometric calculator with proper input handling and no signs of malicious intent. It poses no security risks based on the provided implementation.",
