  "purpose": "Calculate the area of geometric figures (circle and triangle) based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters via keyword arguments (__init__ method). No external data sources or input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data output beyond function returns or prints, which are not sensitive data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs) flows into calculations, but there are no external or untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for error messages instead of raising exceptions could be considered unconventional but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for calculating areas of specific shapes, with straightforward mathematical calculations. It uses math library functions properly and handles key errors. No user input or network activity, nor any code that dynamically executes external code or manipulates system resources maliciously. The presence of print statements for errors is benign in this context. No obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or suspicious patterns found. The code appears to be a simple utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic geometric calculator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs simple calculations and handles errors gracefully, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
