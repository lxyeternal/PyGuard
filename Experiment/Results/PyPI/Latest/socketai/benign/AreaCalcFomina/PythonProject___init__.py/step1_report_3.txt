{
  "purpose": "The code imports everything from the module '.area', likely a relative import within a package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; import statement alone does not facilitate data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The import uses a relative import syntax ('.area'), which is valid Python but may be suspicious if used improperly; no code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement, importing all symbols from a relative module named 'area'. This is a standard Python feature used for modular code organization. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity is evident from this snippet alone. The import does not involve data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. Given only this line, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple relative import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a normal part of a Python package's internal structure.",
