  "purpose": "Import all contents from a relative module named 'area'",
  "sources": "Import statement pulling in contents from '.area' module",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; potential for imported module to contain sinks",
  "flows": "Imported module's code execution flows into current namespace; no direct data flow from untrusted sources in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (import *) can lead to namespace pollution, potential for malicious code in imported module",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement using relative import syntax. This statement alone does not execute any code or process input data. The security concern primarily depends on the contents of the '.area' module, which is not provided. The import statement itself is standard Python syntax. However, using 'import *' can mask malicious or unwanted code within the imported module. Since no further code is provided, it's impossible to determine if the imported module contains malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are directly evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement. The security risk depends on the contents of the '.area' module. There are no direct indicators of malicious behavior in this snippet, but the use of 'import *' warrants caution as the imported module could contain harmful code.",
