  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module '.area'.",
  "sources": "Import statement that loads code from a local module named '.area'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are evident in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible from this snippet alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a relative import with a wildcard '*', which is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious. No suspicious code behavior or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal import statement importing everything from a local module named '.area'. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. The use of relative import with '*' may be a design choice but is not suspicious by itself. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious intent or security risks. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected based on this fragment.",
