  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Issue Present?** Yes, the code matches the original code snippet.  \n- **Logic & Reasoning:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a simple relative import with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.1 — reasonable given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Issue Present?** Yes, the code matches the original snippet.  \n- **Logic & Reasoning:** Highlights that 'import *' can be problematic for namespace pollution but not malicious.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, malware 0, security risk 0.2 — acceptable.  \n- **Verdict:** No malicious activity; the concern about 'import *' is valid but not indicative of malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Issue Present?** Yes, code matches.  \n- **Logic & Reasoning:** Reiterates that this is a standard import with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Issue Present?** Yes, code matches.  \n- **Logic & Reasoning:** Same as above; no malicious behavior, just a standard import.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.1 — reasonable.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Issue Present?** Yes, code matches.  \n- **Logic & Reasoning:** Correctly notes that 'import *' can be risky due to namespace pollution, and the actual risk depends on the imported module's content.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.5, malware 0, security risk 0.2 — acceptable, given the uncertainty about the imported module's content.  \n- **Verdict:** No direct malicious activity, but the caution about 'import *' is valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code snippet being benign.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. The highest concern is about the use of 'import *', which is more of a code quality issue than a security risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a simple relative import statement, standard in Python packages.  \n- No evidence of malicious behavior, code obfuscation, or data exfiltration.  \n- The only concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious code if the imported module is malicious, but there's no evidence here.\n\n### **My Overall Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (to reflect the potential risk of 'import *' in a malicious module, but not in this case)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign; the scores in the reports are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
