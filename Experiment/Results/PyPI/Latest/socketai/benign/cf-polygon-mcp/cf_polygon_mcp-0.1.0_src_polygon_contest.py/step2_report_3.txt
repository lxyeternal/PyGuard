  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard API client component for contest problem retrieval.\n- They highlight extensive debug print statements, flexible response parsing, and robust error handling.\n- No reports identify hardcoded secrets, backdoors, malicious code, or suspicious network activity.\n- The malware scores are all 0, and the security risks are low (~0.2), which aligns with the descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Issues:\n- **Presence of Debug Statements:** All reports note debug print statements that could leak sensitive info if exposed in production. These are not malicious but should be cleaned up.\n- **Response Parsing Logic:** The code handles multiple formats, which, while complex, is a common pattern for resilient API clients.\n- **No Hardcoded Secrets or Malicious Constructs:** No evidence of backdoors, code injection, or malicious payloads.\n- **External Data & Network:** Only the API call via `_make_request` is performed; no suspicious external activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flaws & Reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify the extensive fallback parsing as potentially error-prone but not malicious.\n- The absence of any malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation is consistent across reports.\n- The code's purpose is clear, and the response handling, while verbose, is typical for accommodating inconsistent API responses.\n\n### Scores & Justifications:\n- **Malware Score (0):** No malicious code, payload, or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score (~0.2):** The main concern is debug print statements, which are not security threats but could leak info. This justifies a low but non-zero score.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Remove or disable debug print statements in production.\n- Consider stricter validation of API responses to reduce parsing errors.\n- No changes needed to the security assessment based on the current code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on the detailed reviews, I concur with the reports' conclusions: **the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities detected**.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to debug statements, not a security risk)\n\n**Additional note:** The code is well-structured for its purpose, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical API client component for contest problem retrieval, with extensive fallback parsing and debug output. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware score should remain at 0.",
