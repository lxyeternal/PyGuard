  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client for contest problem retrieval, with no malicious activity or backdoors detected. The only issue is verbose debug output, which could leak sensitive info if logs are exposed. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation score 0, and security risk score about 0.2. It is recommended to remove or disable debug print statements in production to improve security hygiene, but they do not constitute a security threat."
