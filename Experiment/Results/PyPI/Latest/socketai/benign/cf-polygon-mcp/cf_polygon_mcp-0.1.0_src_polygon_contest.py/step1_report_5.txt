{
  "purpose": "This code manages contest sessions by interfacing with an API to retrieve contest problems and process the data into Problem objects.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the parameters for API requests (method, params), the API response from self.client._make_request, and potentially untrusted data from API responses.",
  "sinks": "Data output sinks include returning the list of Problem objects, printing debug information, and raising exceptions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API request via _make_request into processing logic, where responses are parsed, validated, and converted into Problem objects; also includes debug print statements.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of verbose debug print statements, flexible handling of various API response formats, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no dynamic code execution or network operations are observed. No backdoors or hidden functions identified.",
  "analysis": "The code securely interacts with an external API via a client object, handles responses robustly with multiple format checks, and converts data into Problem objects. The response handling logic appears complex but aimed at accommodating diverse API formats, not malicious. Debug prints do not pose a security risk but should be removed in production. No obfuscated code, code injection, or suspicious behavior detected. No external network calls or data exfiltration present. The code’s purpose aligns with legitimate contest data processing. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate API interactions and data processing with extensive format handling and debugging. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is apparent. It appears safe and aligned with standard data retrieval and processing practices.",
