{
  "purpose": "This code implements a client for interacting with the Polygon API for problem and contest management, including request signing, API requests, and session creation.",
  "sources": "Reads API credentials (api_key, api_secret), user input parameters for API requests, and random values for signature generation.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external API endpoints, especially the requests.get() call; sensitive data such as apiKey and apiSecret used in signature generation.",
  "flows": "Input data (api_key, api_secret, parameters) are used in _generate_api_signature to create apiSig, which is then sent via HTTP GET in _make_request; responses are parsed and returned or raise exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.randint() for signature salt; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard hashing with hashlib.sha512; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; no suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs API requests with cryptographic signatures using a secure hash function, includes standard HTTP request handling, and creates session objects for problems and contests. It does not contain any code injection, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The use of random for signature salt is acceptable here and not suspicious. No secrets are hardcoded; API credentials are expected to be provided externally. The code is straightforward and conforms to typical API client patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client implementation with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It performs secure request signing, proper data handling, and session management without any harmful actions.",
