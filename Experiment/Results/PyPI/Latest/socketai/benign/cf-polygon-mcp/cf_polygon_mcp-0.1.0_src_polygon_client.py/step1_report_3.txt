{
  "purpose": "The code implements a client for interacting with the Polygon API, handling request signing, and fetching problems and problem info.",
  "sources": "User inputs include API keys, secrets, and method parameters; environment variables are not used; random number generation is used for signatures.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external API endpoint; response processing for data retrieval.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (API keys, secrets, method arguments) are used to generate signed requests; responses are parsed into objects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.randint for API signature; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns; signature generation follows documented process.",
  "analysis": "The code generates API signatures using a 6-digit random number combined with SHA-512 hashing, which is a standard approach for request signing. The use of 'random.randint' for generating 'rand' introduces non-determinism but is not inherently malicious. Request parameters are assembled securely, and responses are processed with error handling. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found; the code interacts only with external APIs and local objects, without suspicious data exfiltration or system manipulation. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward API client with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an API client for Polygon, with secure request signing and data retrieval functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The use of random for signature generation aligns with typical security practices for nonce creation.",
