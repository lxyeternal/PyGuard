{
  "purpose": "A client for the Polygon API that handles signature generation, request management, and session creation.",
  "sources": "User-provided API key and secret, function parameters, internal random number generator for nonce.",
  "sinks": "External HTTP requests via requests.get(), response handling, and data parsing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and secrets are used to generate a signature, which is sent as part of the request; responses are processed and returned or used to create session objects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.randint() for nonce generation in signature; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; standard request signing process.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard API client with proper request signing involving a nonce and SHA-512 hashing. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of random.randint() for nonce is acceptable for non-cryptographic purposes. The code handles secrets securely, makes requests properly, and processes responses without suspicious behavior. No signs of malware, data leaks, or malicious activity are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured API client with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The use of randomness in signature generation is standard for nonces, and no suspicious activity is evident. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate.",
