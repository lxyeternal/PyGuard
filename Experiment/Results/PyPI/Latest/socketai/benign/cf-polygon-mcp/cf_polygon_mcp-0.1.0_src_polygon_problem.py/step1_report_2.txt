{
  "purpose": "The code provides a session interface for interacting with a problem management API, including retrieving and updating problem info, statements, files, and solutions.",
  "sources": "User inputs such as problem_id, pin, method, params, and file names. Data fetched from API responses.",
  "sinks": "API request methods (_make_request) with method names and parameters, and file content returned as bytes.",
  "flows": "User inputs (problem_id, pin, method, params, filenames) → _make_problem_request (API calls) → response data → various getters and updaters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or system calls observed. Use of standard API request patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical API client wrapper for a problem management system. It handles constructing requests, parsing responses, and providing convenient methods for users. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or system damage. It does not contain obfuscated code or hidden behavior. The parameters and data flow are straightforward. The code relies on the client object for API communication, which appears standard. No sensitive information handling or malicious data leaks are evident. Overall, the code functions as a safe API interaction layer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client implementation for problem management with no malicious behavior detected. It operates by sending and receiving data through defined API calls, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code present.",
