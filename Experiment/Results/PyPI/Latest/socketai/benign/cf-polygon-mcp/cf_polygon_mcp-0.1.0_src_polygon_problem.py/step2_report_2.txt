  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the potential security implications, correctness, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward API wrapper managing problem data. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected. It handles data securely within API requests and responses.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **malware:** 0 — consistent, no malicious activity.\n  - **obfuscated:** 0 — code appears clear.\n  - **securityRisk:** 0.1 — very low, given the nature of API wrappers, some minimal risk if API is compromised.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a standard API client with no malicious intent or obfuscation. No suspicious network activity or embedded secrets.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **malware:** 0 — appropriate.\n  - **obfuscated:** 0.\n  - **securityRisk:** 0 — justified.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also a typical API wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. Handles data via API calls and returns raw bytes for files.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **malware:** 0.\n  - **obfuscated:** 0.\n  - **securityRisk:** 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a standard API client, with no suspicious operations, secrets, or malicious behaviors. The only notable aspect is handling raw bytes, which is typical.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **malware:** 0.\n  - **obfuscated:** 0.\n  - **securityRisk:** 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, a straightforward API wrapper with no malicious activities, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **malware:** 0.\n  - **obfuscated:** 0.\n  - **securityRisk:** 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear code.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, as expected for an API wrapper with no suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **On the code itself:** The code appears benign, well-structured, and consistent with standard API client implementations.\n- **On the scores:** They are reasonable and consistent across all reports.\n- **Potential for higher risk scores:** None justified, given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### My personal estimate (post-analysis):\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, based on the API interaction context, but no actual security issues.\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code and reports are aligned, and no further action is necessary.",
