{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class 'ProblemSession' to interact with an API for problem management, including fetching and updating problem info, statements, files, solutions, and related data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'client' object via method '_make_request', and from method arguments (e.g., problem_id, pin, params). It also reads API responses and specific fields within those responses.",
  "sinks": "Uses data in parameters sent via '_make_request' to the API, including problem ID, pin, and other request parameters. Also, returns raw bytes of files and solutions fetched from the API.",
  "flows": "Input data (problem_id, pin, params) flows into '_make_problem_request', which sends requests via 'client._make_request'. The responses are processed and returned or converted into objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code does not perform unsafe operations such as executing untrusted code, system calls, or network connections outside the provided API request mechanism. No obfuscated code or misleading variable use observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward API wrapper for problem management, utilizing request parameters and response processing. It does not include any suspicious or malicious operations, backdoors, or data exfiltration. All input and output are handled through the provided 'client' interface. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent. The functions serve typical data retrieval and update functions. The code structure and usage are standard for such API wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client class for problem management with no malicious behavior detected. It simply wraps API calls for a problem system, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
