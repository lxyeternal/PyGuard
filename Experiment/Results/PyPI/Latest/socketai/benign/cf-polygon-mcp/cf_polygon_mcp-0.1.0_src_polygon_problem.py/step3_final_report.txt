  "purpose": "API client wrapper for managing problem data, including fetching and updating problem info, statements, files, and solutions.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, API request parameters, response data from client._make_request calls",
  "sinks": "API request execution via _make_request, response parsing into domain models, returning raw bytes for files and solutions",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assembled into request parameters; responses are parsed and returned or converted into models",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper with standard request and response handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. Data flows are transparent, with proper access checks before modifications. No suspicious network activity or embedded secrets are present. The code relies on an external client object assumed to be secure. The response parsing and request parameter construction are consistent and safe. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API client for problem management. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
