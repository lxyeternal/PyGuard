  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward API wrapper functions that interact with Polygon's API.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are noted.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The functions are simple, parameter-driven, and perform standard API calls.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Wrapper functions for Polygon API.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, straightforward parameter passing.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (full confidence)\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no issues.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar API wrapper functions.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still very high.\n- **securityRisk:** 0.2, slightly higher but still low.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Justification for scores:**\n\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Slightly higher security risk score possibly due to passing secrets as parameters, which in a real deployment should be secured, but this alone isn't malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate. The security risk score is low but justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar analysis, with confidence 0.9, malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- Slightly lower security risk score, consistent with the previous reports.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same pattern, with confidence 0.9, malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same overall conclusion, with scores consistent with previous reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** None. The code is a simple, standard API wrapper.\n- **Malware or malicious activity:** None detected. Scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; scores of 0 are correct.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, justified by the fact that secrets are passed as parameters, which is typical but should be handled carefully in production.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- The reports' scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed based on the analysis.\n- The overall malware score should remain at **0**, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score remains **0**.\n- The security risk score is low (~0.1–0.2), reflecting standard API usage with sensitive data passed as parameters.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, typical API wrapper; sensitive data passed as parameters)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, straightforward, and free of malicious intent. The scores given in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
