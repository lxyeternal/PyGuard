  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Functionality and Security Aspects:**\n\n- The code provides straightforward wrapper functions around the `PolygonClient` API, passing API credentials and parameters to retrieve problem data, problem info, and statements.\n- Sensitive data (`api_key`, `api_secret`) are passed as function parameters, not hardcoded, which is a good practice.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The functions are simple, with no data processing or handling that could introduce injection, leakage, or backdoors.\n- The code appears to interact with an external API in a standard manner, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**2. Issues Confirmed:**\n\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- No evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors.\n- No data leaks or insecure practices identified.\n- The code's logic aligns with typical API wrapper implementations.\n\n**3. Logical or Reasoning Flaws in the Reports:**\n\n- The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign and free of malicious intent, which appears accurate.\n- They assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern given the code's nature.\n\n**4. Score Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (~0.1-0.2), justified by the fact that API credentials are passed as parameters, which could be risky if misused, but in this context, it's standard practice.\n\n**5. Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9-1) are justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**6. Potential for Hidden Risks or Assumptions:**\n\n- The code relies on the `PolygonClient` implementation, which isn't provided here. If that client has vulnerabilities, they are outside this code's scope.\n- Passing API credentials as parameters is common but should be handled securely in production environments (e.g., via environment variables). However, this is a standard pattern and not inherently malicious.\n\n**7. Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard API wrapper with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, mainly due to passing credentials as parameters, which is acceptable but should be managed carefully in production.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, well-structured, and does not pose security risks based on the provided analysis.",
