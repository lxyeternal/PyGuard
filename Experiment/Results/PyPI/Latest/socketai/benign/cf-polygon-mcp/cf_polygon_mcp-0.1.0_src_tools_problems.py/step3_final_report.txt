  "purpose": "Wrapper functions around Polygon API to retrieve problem data, info, and statements, passing API credentials as parameters.",
  "sources": "API key and secret parameters, session creation, and method calls to PolygonClient.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified; external API calls are standard.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (API credentials, problem IDs, optional PIN) flow into client creation and method calls, with no evident malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks. Credentials are passed as parameters, which is common practice but should be managed securely in production. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code's logic aligns with standard API interaction patterns, and the external client is assumed to be secure. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk is due to parameter-based credential passing, which is acceptable but should be handled securely in deployment. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
