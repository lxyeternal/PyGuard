{
  "purpose": "The code provides wrapper functions to interact with the PolygonClient API for retrieving problems, problem info, and statements from the Polygon platform.",
  "sources": "API key and secret inputs, problem_id, pin, and other parameters used to configure API client calls",
  "sinks": "API client methods that send requests over the network using provided credentials and parameters",
  "flows": "Input parameters (API keys, problem IDs, pins) flow into client method calls which then communicate with Polygon's servers",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns, no unusual data handling observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily creates API client instances with user-provided credentials and calls methods to fetch data. The API key and secret are passed directly into the client constructor, which is standard for authorized API calls. There are no dynamic code evaluations, code injections, or data leaks. No suspicious data flows or backdoors are apparent. Usage of parameters is straightforward and aligns with typical API interaction patterns. The code does not perform any sensitive or insecure operations such as storing secrets insecurely or executing untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API wrapper for interacting with Polygon's problem data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The only notable aspect is that the API credentials are handled via function parameters, which is normal but should be used securely in production. Overall, this code is safe and does not pose a security threat.",
