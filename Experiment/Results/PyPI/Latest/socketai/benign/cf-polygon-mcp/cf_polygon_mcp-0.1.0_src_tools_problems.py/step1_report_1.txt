{
  "purpose": "The code provides wrapper functions to interact with the PolygonClient API for retrieving problems, problem info, and problem statements from Polygon.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: api_key, api_secret, problem_id, pin, show_deleted, name, owner",
  "sinks": "API calls within PolygonClient methods (get_problems, get_problem_info, create_problem_session, get_statements)",
  "flows": "Parameters such as api_key, api_secret, problem_id, pin flow into API client methods which communicate with external Polygon API",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets are passed as parameters. No suspicious code patterns, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code uses parameter inputs to initialize API client instances and make calls to Polygon's API. All sensitive data (api_key, api_secret) are handled as input arguments, not hardcoded. The functions are simple wrappers without any data processing that could introduce injection or leakage. There are no evident backdoors, malicious network activity, or unusual behaviors. The use of session and method calls appears standard for API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as intended to fetch problem data from Polygon without any signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious behaviors.",
