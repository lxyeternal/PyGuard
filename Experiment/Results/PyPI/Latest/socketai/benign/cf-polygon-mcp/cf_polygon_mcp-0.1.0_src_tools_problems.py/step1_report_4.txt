{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to interact with the Polygon API for retrieving problem lists, problem info, and problem statements.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: api_key, api_secret, show_deleted, problem_id, name, owner, pin",
  "sinks": "API client method calls that transmit api_key and api_secret, and problem_id/pin parameters",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into API client instantiations and method calls which send data over the network",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious data handling, no obfuscated code, no unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code securely accepts API credentials as parameters, uses them to instantiate a PolygonClient object, and calls methods to retrieve data. All sensitive data (api_key, api_secret) are passed as parameters and not hardcoded. The functions appear to facilitate legitimate API interactions without data leakage, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. No user input or untrusted data sources are directly handled within the code, reducing risks of injection or leaks. The session creation and statement retrieval processes seem straightforward and typical for API usage. No indications of malicious activity or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured API interaction module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It responsibly manages API credentials and performs expected operations.",
