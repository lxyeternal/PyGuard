{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to interact with Polygon API for retrieving problems, problem info, and problem statements.",
  "sources": "API keys (api_key, api_secret) provided as function arguments; PolygonClient instantiation; session creation with API credentials.",
  "sinks": "API calls made via PolygonClient methods, particularly get_problems, get_problem_info, create_problem_session, and get_statements.",
  "flows": "API keys flow into PolygonClient instances, which then make network requests to Polygon API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious intent. Usage appears straightforward and aligns with typical API interaction patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply wraps API calls to Polygon's client library, passing parameters such as API keys, problem IDs, and optional filters. No data is stored insecurely, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or malicious code detected. API keys are passed as arguments, not hardcoded. The function calls are standard for API interaction. No untrusted input handling concerns are evident beyond expected parameter passing. The overall structure indicates legitimate API usage for data retrieval purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of API wrappers for Polygon. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It correctly handles API credentials as parameters and performs typical API calls to fetch problem data.",
