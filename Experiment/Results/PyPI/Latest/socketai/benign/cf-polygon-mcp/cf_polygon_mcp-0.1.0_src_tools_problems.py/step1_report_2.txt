{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to interact with the Polygon API for retrieving problem lists, problem info, and problem statements.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: api_key, api_secret, problem_id, pin, show_deleted, name, owner",
  "sinks": "API client method calls with sensitive credentials (api_key, api_secret), session creation, data retrieval",
  "flows": "Credentials (api_key, api_secret) flow into PolygonClient constructor, which then interacts with the API; session is created with potential PIN, and data is retrieved from API responses",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code behavior, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no backdoors or hidden functionalities",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward API wrapper functions for Polygon service, passing API keys and parameters to client methods. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, suspicious data handling, or insecure practices. Sensitive data is passed as function arguments and used directly in API calls. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected. The code does not perform any unsafe data manipulation, nor does it leak data outside intended API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles credentials and data retrieval securely by passing parameters directly to API methods. There are no anomalies indicating malware or malicious behavior.",
