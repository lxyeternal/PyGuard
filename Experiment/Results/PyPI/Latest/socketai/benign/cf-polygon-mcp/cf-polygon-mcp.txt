The only issue is verbose debug output, which could leak sensitive info if logs are exposed. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation score 0, and security risk score about 0.2. It is recommended to remove or disable debug print statements in production to improve security hygiene, but they do not constitute a security threat."

The use of randomness in signature generation is standard for nonces, and no suspicious activity is evident. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate."
