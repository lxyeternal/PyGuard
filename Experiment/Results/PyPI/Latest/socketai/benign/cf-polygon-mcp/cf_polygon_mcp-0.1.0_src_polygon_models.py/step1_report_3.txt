{
  "purpose": "Define data models for handling problem and resource data in a competitive programming platform, including parsing and validation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from dictionaries, typically API responses or external inputs during object creation.",
  "sinks": "Data is stored in class attributes, potentially used for further processing or exposed via class methods.",
  "flows": "Input dictionaries -> data validation and conversion -> object instantiation -> class methods for decision-making.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious function calls, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, no obfuscated code. The code primarily performs data parsing, enum handling, and object creation. No malicious or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data models using Pydantic for validation, with methods to create instances from dictionaries. It handles time conversions, enum mappings, and includes error handling via try-except blocks. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity. It is designed for safe data handling, with proper type conversions and validation. No external or insecure behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data modeling module for a problem platform, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs data validation, parsing, and encapsulation safely. No malware or security issues are detected.",
