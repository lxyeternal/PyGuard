  "purpose": "Data models and parsing routines for contest problem and solution metadata, including enums and validation methods.",
  "sources": "API response dictionaries, data conversion functions, enum handling, timestamp parsing.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; data is processed internally without network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "API data -> data model instances via from_dict methods, with type conversions and validation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for debugging; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard data models using pydantic, with straightforward data parsing, enum conversions, and timestamp handling. No network access, code injection, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The print statements are for debugging and do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk 0, reflecting a benign, well-structured data layer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of data models for contest problem data, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's purpose.",
