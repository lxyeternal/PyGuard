  "purpose": "Convert seconds into a human-readable relative time string, indicating past or future.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'seconds' and internal threshold calculations.",
  "sinks": "Return statement formatting the output string based on computed value and suffix.",
  "flows": "Input 'seconds' -> threshold checks -> determine 'value' and 'unit' -> pluralization -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward implementation with no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly handles negative and positive seconds, thresholds for seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks, and pluralization. It performs logical operations without vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. All reports are empty, indicating no issues or concerns. The code is simple, clear, and functions as intended. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. Given the lack of evidence, the malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score very low, around 0.1.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, correct, and secure. The reports do not indicate any malicious activity or vulnerabilities. All scores should be minimal, reflecting no threats.",
