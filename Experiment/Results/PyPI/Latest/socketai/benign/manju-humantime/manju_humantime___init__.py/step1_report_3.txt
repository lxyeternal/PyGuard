  "purpose": "Importing the function 'humanize_time_difference' from a local module named 'humanize'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'humanize', specifically the 'humanize_time_difference' function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this single import statement; no untrusted data handling or output occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flow beyond importing occurs in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no unusual syntax, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function from a relative module, which is a common practice in Python projects. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity is detectable from this single line. Since this is only an import statement, there are no source-to-sink flows or anomalous behaviors to evaluate further.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical import used in Python modules.",
