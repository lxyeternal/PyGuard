  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The report confirms that the code imports `humanize_time_difference` from a local module `humanize`.\n- No sinks, data flows, or anomalies are identified.\n- The analysis states this is a standard import with no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence is high (0.9), and malware/security risk scores are low (0.1 and 0.1 respectively).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion is accurate. The import statement is benign, and there's no evidence of malicious activity. The slight security risk score (0.1) might be a conservative buffer, but given the minimal code, it could be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to report 1, it describes a straightforward import.\n- No suspicious patterns or anomalies.\n- Confidence is perfect (1), and all scores are zero.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion is correct. No security concerns here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, a simple import of `humanize_time_difference` from `humanize`.\n- No data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n- The analysis correctly states this is benign.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report is accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as previous, a straightforward import.\n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- Correct conclusion.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo concerns here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: a standard import with no anomalies.\n- No suspicious behavior or data flow.\n- Correct conclusion.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis report is also accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign import statement.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code fragment is purely an import statement with no malicious or security concern.\n- Malware score should remain at 0.\n- Obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- Risk score could be lowered from 0.1 to 0, as there's no security risk demonstrated.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are thorough and accurate given the limited code snippet. No further action needed.",
