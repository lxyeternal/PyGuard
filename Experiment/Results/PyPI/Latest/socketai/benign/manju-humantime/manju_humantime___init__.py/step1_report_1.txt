  "purpose": "Importing the humanize_time_difference function from a local module named humanize.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'humanize' when importing 'humanize_time_difference'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; there are no data flows beyond the module import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function from a local module, which is typical in modular Python code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious logic. The snippet is limited, so no additional context is available, but nothing appears suspicious or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import operation from a local module without any suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks based on this fragment.",
