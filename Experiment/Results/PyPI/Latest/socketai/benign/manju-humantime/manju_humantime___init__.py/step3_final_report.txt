  "purpose": "Import the function 'humanize_time_difference' from the local 'humanize' module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions.",
  "flows": "None; the import is static and does not involve data flow at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing a function from a local module. It involves no data processing, external interactions, or dynamic behavior. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of this code fragment. The high confidence scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores reflect this accurately.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
