  "purpose": "Import the function 'humanize_time_difference' from a local module named 'humanize'.",
  "sources": "Reading the local module 'humanize' to access 'humanize_time_difference'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only a static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import statement; no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function from a relative module, which is standard practice in Python projects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious code patterns. The import alone does not indicate malicious intent. Since only an import statement is present, the code does not perform any action that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a normal part of a larger codebase. No malware or security risks are detected based on this minimal code.",
