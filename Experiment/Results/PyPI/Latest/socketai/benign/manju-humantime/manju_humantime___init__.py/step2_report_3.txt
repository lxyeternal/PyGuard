  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code is a straightforward import statement; no issues detected.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n   - **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are both 0, securityRisk is 0.1. Given the benign nature, these seem reasonable.\n   - **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no suspicious activity.\n   \n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import; no issues.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None. The analysis is accurate.\n   - **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, securityRisk is 0. No concerns here.\n   \n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue presence:** Again, just an import statement; no issues.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is consistent.\n   - **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, securityRisk is 0.\n   \n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue presence:** No issues; only an import.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, securityRisk is 0.\n   \n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above; benign import.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, securityRisk is 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports are about a simple import statement.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and benign nature, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is appropriate.\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The security risk scores of 0.1 in some reports seem slightly high for such trivial code; I would recommend setting these to 0 for consistency.\n- The high confidence scores (mostly 1) are justified given the clear, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: a simple, standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious characteristics.",
