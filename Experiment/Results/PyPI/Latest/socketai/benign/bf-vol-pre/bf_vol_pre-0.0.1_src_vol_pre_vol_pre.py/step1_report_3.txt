{
  "purpose": "The code implements a GUI application for voltage prediction based on skin features using a pre-trained machine learning model and scaler objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from a user via GUI entry, and loads models and scalers from pickle files located at '../../res/'.",
  "sinks": "The code executes predictions using loaded models and scalers, outputs results to the GUI, and prints prediction information to the console.",
  "flows": "User inputs data -> input is validated and converted -> scaled using loaded scaler -> prediction made with loaded model -> output displayed in GUI",
  "anomalies": "The code loads pickle files from a relative path that could potentially be manipulated; however, no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present. The print statement outputs prediction info, but nothing indicates malicious intent. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script loads pre-trained models and scalers via pickle from a relative directory, which can be a security concern if the files are tampered with, but this is standard practice in ML applications. The calculation function performs input validation, data transformation, prediction, and displays results, all without any suspicious or malicious code. There are no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no obfuscated or unusual code constructs. The use of GUI components and the logic flow are straightforward and typical of an ML prediction tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard GUI application for voltage prediction using pre-trained models. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The only minor concern is the loading of models from relative paths, which could be exploited if the environment is compromised, but this is common practice and not inherently malicious.",
