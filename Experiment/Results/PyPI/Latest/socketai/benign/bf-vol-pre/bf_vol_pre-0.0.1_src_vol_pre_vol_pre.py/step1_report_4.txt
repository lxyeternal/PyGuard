  "purpose": "A GUI tool for predicting voltage based on input features using a pre-trained machine learning model.",
  "sources": "File reading from '../../res/' directory for pickle files (sc_X.pkl, sc_y.pkl, opto_predict_svr.pkl). User input from the GUI text entry (input_var).",
  "sinks": "Use of pickle.load to deserialize models and scalers. Model prediction results are displayed in GUI and printed to console. No external data outputs or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input data read from GUI input → validated and converted → transformed via loaded scaler → prediction via loaded model → output displayed in GUI.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code performs standard data transformations and model prediction; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads models and scalers from pickle files, processes user input with validation, and performs predictions using a pre-trained model. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors are evident. It relies solely on local files and standard libraries. The print statement outputs prediction info, which is typical for debugging or logging but not malicious. The use of pickle for deserializing models is common; however, if the pickle files were maliciously replaced, it could lead to security issues, but this is outside the scope of the code itself.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be a straightforward GUI application for voltage prediction, with no indications of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign predictive tool that loads models and performs predictions based on user input. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is the security of the pickle files themselves, but the code does not contain malicious logic.",
