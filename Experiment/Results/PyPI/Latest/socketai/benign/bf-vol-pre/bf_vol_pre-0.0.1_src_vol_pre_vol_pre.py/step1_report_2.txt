{
  "purpose": "The code is a GUI tool for predicting voltage based on user-input features using a pre-trained machine learning model.",
  "sources": "Input from user via Tkinter Entry widget; data loaded from pickle files ('../../res/sc_X.pkl', '../../res/sc_y.pkl', '../../res/opto_predict_svr.pkl').",
  "sinks": "Predicts voltage value and displays result; outputs printed to console; no data is sent externally or written to files.",
  "flows": "User inputs data -> input is validated and transformed -> model predicts -> output is displayed in GUI.",
  "anomalies": "Uses relative file paths ('../../res/...') for loading models and scalers, which could be used to hide or obfuscate malicious files. No obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script loads pre-trained models and scalers from local pickle files, processes user input through GUI, performs standardization, prediction, and displays results. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no code obfuscation, or suspicious behavior observed. The core functionality is a standard ML prediction pipeline with GUI components. No indications of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The only minor concern is the reliance on relative paths for loading resources, which could be exploited if files are replaced maliciously. Overall, the code performs a legitimate function without evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard GUI-based voltage prediction tool using pre-trained models. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. No malware detected. The main concern is potential misuse of file paths, but functionally, it appears safe.",
