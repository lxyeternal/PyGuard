{
  "purpose": "This code provides a GUI tool for voltage prediction based on user-input features, utilizing pre-trained ML models loaded via pickle.",
  "sources": "User input from the Tkinter Entry widget; model and scaler files loaded from relative paths ('../../res/').",
  "sinks": "The predict_vol StringVar updates the GUI with the prediction result; print statements output model info to console.",
  "flows": "User inputs features -> input validation -> numpy array transformation -> data scaling via sc_X -> prediction via svr_model -> inverse transform via sc_y -> display result.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses relative paths for loading models, which could be manipulated externally; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward ML prediction GUI. It loads models/scalers with pickle, validates input, performs transformations, predicts, and displays results. No network activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The only potential concern is the trustworthiness of the pickle files loaded from relative paths, which could be exploited if files are maliciously replaced. The code itself does not contain malicious logic or backdoors. The input validation is standard, and the overall structure is clear and consistent. No suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard ML prediction GUI application with no signs of malware or malicious obfuscation. The main security consideration is ensuring the integrity of the external pickle files and environment security, not the code itself.",
