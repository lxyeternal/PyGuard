  "purpose": "This code is a GUI application for predicting voltage based on skin features using a pre-trained SVM model and feature scaling, providing input validation and displaying results.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the user via Tkinter Entry widget; loads model, scaler, and model parameters from pickle files from a relative path.",
  "sinks": "Uses the loaded model to make predictions; outputs results to the GUI via StringVar. No untrusted data is written to external systems.",
  "flows": "User inputs data -> validated and converted -> scaled -> predicted via model -> result displayed in GUI.",
  "anomalies": "Loads pickled objects from relative paths which could be manipulated; no validation or sanitization of pickle files; no authentication or security checks for file access.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs data input, validation, transformation, and prediction. It loads models and scalers via pickle from a relative directory, which could be manipulated if the environment is compromised. The use of pickle for loading models is common but risky if the source is untrusted; however, in a controlled environment, this is standard. The code does not include network communications, system modifications, or other suspicious behavior. It processes input securely with validation and provides output via the GUI. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard GUI-based prediction tool that loads pre-trained models and performs predictions based on user input. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks beyond the standard risks associated with loading pickle files from potentially untrusted sources. The use of relative paths for loading models could be a concern if the environment is compromised, but it does not constitute malicious code.",
