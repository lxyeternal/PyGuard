  "purpose": "The script provides a GUI tool for predicting voltage based on skin features using a pre-trained Support Vector Regression model.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from a user via a Tkinter Entry widget. It loads pickled model and scaler objects from local files on disk.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the 'calculate' function which processes input, performs transformation, and makes a prediction using the loaded model. No untrusted data is written elsewhere.",
  "flows": "User input → input_var.get() → split and convert to float → apply transformations and prediction → display result",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries (numpy, pickle, tkinter) and loads pre-trained models and scalers from local pickle files. It defines functions for input validation, prediction, and UI control. The 'calculate' function transforms user input, applies a ML model, and displays results, with no evident malicious logic. File paths are relative and used consistently for model loading. The GUI code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or network activity. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code does not attempt to access or exfiltrate system data, nor does it perform any suspicious operations beyond standard ML prediction workflow.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign GUI tool for voltage prediction using pre-trained ML models. It performs expected data handling, has no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It is safe for use.",
