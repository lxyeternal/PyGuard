  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows or untrusted data handling observed",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal; it only performs imports without any suspicious constructs or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing from local modules. There are no external data sources, no user inputs, nor any dynamic code execution. The simplicity suggests standard module import behavior without malicious intent. No obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
