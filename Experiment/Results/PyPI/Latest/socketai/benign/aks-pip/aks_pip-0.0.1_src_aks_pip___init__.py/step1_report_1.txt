  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from local modules 'cal' and 'version'.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules within the package ('cal' and 'version').",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external data usage observed.",
  "flows": "Imports bring in code or data from internal modules, with no apparent external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements for local modules. There are no external inputs, no data being sent or retrieved over networks, and no dynamic or unsafe code execution. The imports are standard Python practices for modular code organization. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and only imports local modules without any malicious intent or security risks.",
