  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions or variables ('sub' and 'version') from local modules within the same package, likely for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.cal and .version)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points observed in this code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows are apparent; simply imports functions/variables for use within the package",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in these import statements",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing elements from internal modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no external network activity, and no obfuscated code. The imports are from relative modules, indicating internal package structure. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent are evident from these lines.",
