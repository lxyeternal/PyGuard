{
  "purpose": "The code performs simple relative imports from local modules 'cal' and 'version', typical for a Python package structure.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules '.cal' and '.version'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing 'sub' from '.cal' and 'version' from '.version'. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The code is straightforward, standard for Python modules, and lacks any malicious or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of risks. No anomalies or malicious behavior are present, and the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated at 0, and overall security risk at 0.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
