  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as simple import statements from local modules.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or dynamic code execution are observed.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code snippets are minimal and typical for Python packages.\n\n**Confirming the code:**\n- The provided code:\n  ```python\n  from .cal import sub\n  from .version import version\n  ```\n  matches the descriptions. These are standard relative imports within a package.\n\n**Error, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No errors or mistakes are present in the code or in the reasoning of the reports.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\n- These scores are reasonable given the evidence.\n\n**Risk scores justification:**\n- Since there is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk, the scores are appropriate.\n- The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious intent.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating clear, straightforward code.\n- The overall security risk is 0, as the code does not pose any threat.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is static and simple.\n- The reports do not suggest any suspicious behavior that warrants a higher score.\n\n**Consistency:**\n- The scores are consistent across all reports.\n- The conclusions align with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The scoring is appropriate, and no further action is needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All evidence points to a benign, standard import statement with no malicious or risky behavior.",
