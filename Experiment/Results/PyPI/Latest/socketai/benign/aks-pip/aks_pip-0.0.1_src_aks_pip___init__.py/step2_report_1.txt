  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules ('cal' and 'version' or similar).\n- No external data flows, network activity, or dynamic code execution are observed.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is standard for modular Python projects.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of import statements.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which aligns with the straightforwardness of the code.\n- Malware scores are 0 in all reports, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Review of scores:**\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No report suggests any reason to increase the malware or risk scores.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or challenges:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; there are no assumptions or claims that seem unjustified.\n- Since the code is straightforward, there's no basis for raising suspicion or risk scores.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- The overall security risk should stay at 0.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, harmless import statement with no security issues. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
