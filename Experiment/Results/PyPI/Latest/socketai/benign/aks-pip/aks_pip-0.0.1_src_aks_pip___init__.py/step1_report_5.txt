{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific functions or variables from local modules, likely for use within a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing from local modules: '.cal' and '.version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is minimal and standard for Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward relative imports from internal modules, which is common in Python package structure. No indication of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. It does not process external input, nor does it execute dynamic code or communicate externally. The minimal structure suggests a typical module import statement with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign import statement used within a package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a simple, harmless module import.",
