  "purpose": "Performs subtraction between two numerical inputs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result; no external data sink.",
  "flows": "Input 'a' and 'b' flow into the subtraction operation, then the result flows to the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and lacks suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The function 'sub' takes two parameters and returns their difference. There are no external inputs or outputs beyond the function scope. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic present. The code does not perform any network communication, data storage, or system modifications. It is a simple arithmetic operation with clear and benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a basic subtraction, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
