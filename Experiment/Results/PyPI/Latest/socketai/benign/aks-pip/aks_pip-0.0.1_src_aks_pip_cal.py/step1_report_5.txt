  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and performs a basic arithmetic operation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function 'sub' that subtracts one parameter from another and returns the result. There are no external inputs, environment variables, or suspicious constructs. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The code is minimal, clear, and performs a standard operation without any obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performs a basic subtraction operation, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
