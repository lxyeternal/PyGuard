  "purpose": "Simple subtraction function performing a basic arithmetic operation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' received as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result; no external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow directly to the subtraction operation and then to the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimalistic subtraction function with no external dependencies, no obfuscation, and no suspicious logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores reflecting zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or malicious actions. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and intent. No issues or anomalies are present, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward subtraction function with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
