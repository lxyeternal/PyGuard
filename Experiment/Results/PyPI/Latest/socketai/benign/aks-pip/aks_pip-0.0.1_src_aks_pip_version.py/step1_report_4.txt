  "purpose": "The code specifies a version string, likely part of a package metadata or version declaration.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "None; no data outputs, network communications, or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code contains only a version string assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; a version string is defined without additional context. No suspicious or unusual code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version assignment ('version=\"0.0.1\"'). There are no functions, input/output operations, data flows, or external interactions. This appears to be a fragment or metadata declaration commonly used in package setup files.\n\nNo source, sink, flow, or anomaly signals are present. Since the code is minimal and straightforward, there are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless and purely informational, likely part of package metadata. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
