  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version variable assignment with no logic, input/output, or external interactions. It does not exhibit any behavior that could be malicious or indicate malware. Lack of additional code makes detailed analysis impossible, but the given fragment alone shows no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, containing only a version string declaration without any malicious intent or security risks.",
