  "purpose": "Declare the software version as a simple string assignment.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static assignment in code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment setting version=\"0.0.1\". There are no inputs, outputs, external interactions, or complex logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is minimal and static, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1, all consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a version identifier with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
