{
  "purpose": "Importing the SchipholAPI class from the local api module, likely for use in the application.",
  "sources": "The import statement suggests the code reads the api module for the SchipholAPI class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network operations, file writes, or data leaks are present in this line.",
  "flows": "The code does not include runtime data flow; it only performs a static import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, but the import from a relative module indicates modular design; no suspicious or unusual code features are apparent.",
  "analysis": "This snippet only imports a class from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The minimal nature of the code means there are no apparent security issues or anomalies. Since this is just an import statement, it doesn't by itself pose any security risk or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard import for modular code organization.",
