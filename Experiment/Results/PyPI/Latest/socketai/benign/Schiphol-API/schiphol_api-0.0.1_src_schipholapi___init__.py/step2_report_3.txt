  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports describe a single import statement: `from .api import SchipholAPI`. This is a standard Python import, referencing a local module. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or complex logic. The code snippet is minimal and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a simple import with no malicious behavior or security risks. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Confidence:** Scores are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All zero, consistent with the code being straightforward.  \n- **Malware:** All zero, which is correct; there's no malicious activity in an import statement.  \n- **Security Risk:** All zero, matching the lack of any risky behavior.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is just an import statement with no suspicious features, the risk score should remain at 0. No justification exists for a higher score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is correctly zero across all reports, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize that an import statement alone does not imply malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the content and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security risks in this snippet)\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- If this import is part of a larger codebase, security concerns might arise elsewhere, but based solely on this snippet, there are no issues.\n- No signs of supply chain attack vectors, such as malicious code injection, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current analysis and the evidence provided.",
