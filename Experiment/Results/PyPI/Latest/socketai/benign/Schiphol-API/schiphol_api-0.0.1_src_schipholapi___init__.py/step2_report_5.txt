  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content**: The code is a simple import statement:\n```python\nfrom .api import SchipholAPI\n```\nThis is a standard Python import from a local module, likely part of a larger project.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - **Are the reported issues present?**  \n     All reports uniformly state that the code is a benign import statement with no suspicious activity, no data leaks, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. Given the code snippet, this assessment is accurate.  \n     **Conclusion**: No issues are present in the code.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that this is a minimal, benign import statement with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.  \n   **Conclusion**: The reports are sound.\n\n4. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence scores are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the code is just an import statement with no signs of malicious activity, scores above 0.5 are unjustified.\n   - The reports' scores are appropriate.\n\n6. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not seem to make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that this code alone is benign.\n   - Without additional context, there is no basis to suspect malicious intent.\n\n8. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code snippet and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final Evaluation**:\n- The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious or security issues.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should all remain at 0.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the minimal and benign nature of the code snippet.\n\n**Summary**: The code is safe, and the reports correctly identify no security concerns.",
