{
  "purpose": "A Python class designed to interact with the Schiphol public flights API, providing methods to retrieve flight, destination, airline, aircraft type, and flight ID data.",
  "sources": "The class reads API credentials (app_id, app_key) from constructor parameters; makes HTTP GET requests via requests.get; retrieves data through API endpoints and processes JSON responses.",
  "sinks": "The code does not handle or process untrusted input directly; API responses are parsed and printed, but no data is written to files, databases, or sent over the network beyond the API requests.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., flight_id, destination_id, page numbers, API keys) are used to construct API requests; responses are processed and printed; no external data is written or transmitted outside API calls.",
  "anomalies": "The API credentials (app_id and app_key) are accepted as parameters but are inserted into headers without validation or masking. No explicit handling of sensitive data leaks, but potential credential misuse could occur if app_id/app_key are hardcoded or exposed in logs.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with an external API via requests; it constructs URLs dynamically using string formatting with user-supplied parameters. No evidence of obfuscated or malicious code patterns such as dynamic execution or misleading variables. The print statements are used for debugging or informational purposes. There is no code that performs data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious activity. The credentials are passed as parameters, and no credentials are stored or transmitted insecurely within the code itself. The code appears to follow standard API consumption patterns, with appropriate error handling for request failures. Overall, the code does not contain malware or malicious behavior but relies on external API keys, which if compromised, could be misused.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a straightforward API client for Schiphol's public flight data, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. The only potential security concern is the handling of API credentials, which could be misused if exposed. The code does not exhibit obfuscation, malicious actions, or security risks beyond typical API usage scenarios.",
