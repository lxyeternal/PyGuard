  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- A Python class `SchipholAPI` that interacts with the Schiphol public flights API.\n- Uses `requests` to make GET requests to various endpoints.\n- Accepts user input parameters (flight_id, destination_id, etc.) to construct API requests.\n- Handles request exceptions gracefully.\n- Prints data from responses; returns JSON data.\n- Uses API credentials (`app_id`, `app_key`) passed as constructor parameters.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Issues:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports mainly describe the code as a straightforward API client with no malicious behavior, which aligns with the code. No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious activity are evident.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n  The reports correctly identify the code as a benign API wrapper. They mention potential concerns about handling API credentials (which are passed as parameters), but these are standard practices, not flaws. No significant logical errors or security flaws are identified.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and low security risks (~0.1-0.2). These seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign high risk scores; they all remain below 0.5, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score reflection:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the analysis. No malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly noting that the code is a benign API client.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  The code is a standard API client with no malicious behavior. **Estimated malware score: 0.0**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  No obfuscation or malicious hiding techniques. **Estimated obfuscated score: 0.0**\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The main concern is handling API credentials; if these are exposed or misused, it could be a risk, but in this code, they are passed as parameters, which is standard. No evident vulnerabilities or malicious activities. **Estimated overall security risk: 0.1**\n\n- **Additional considerations:**  \n  - The code prints sensitive data; in production, logging sensitive info should be avoided, but this is not malicious.\n  - No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs.\n  - No signs of supply chain attack or malicious payload.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                                  |\n|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score   | 0.0               | No malicious activity or payload detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated Score| 0.0               | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.               |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1               | Minimal risk; mainly related to handling API credentials.     |\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, well-structured API client with no signs of malware or malicious intent.**",
