  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code, standard API request handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low, primarily due to potential credential exposure if credentials are mishandled)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate API client with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The only minor concern is the handling of API credentials passed as parameters; if these are exposed or logged elsewhere, that could be a risk, but within this code, it’s standard practice. The malware score is appropriately 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to report 1, with emphasis on credentials passed as parameters, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The handling of API keys is typical, and no malicious behavior is evident. The malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Straightforward API client, no obfuscation, no malicious code, standard error handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Benign API wrapper.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Standard API client, no malicious code, no obfuscation, credentials passed as parameters.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is a typical API wrapper with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, no obfuscation, no malicious code, standard request handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Safe API client.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the others; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected across all reports. All reports correctly identify the code as a benign API client.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed or claimed.\n- **Security Risks:** The primary concern is handling of API credentials. Since they are passed as parameters and not hardcoded, the risk is minimal but worth noting if credentials are exposed elsewhere.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- **Overall Confidence:** High, as all reports agree on benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** Given the minimal security concern about API credentials, a low but non-zero score (around 0.2) is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (due to potential credential exposure if credentials are mishandled outside this code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward, benign API client for Schiphol's public flight data API with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the handling of API credentials, which should be managed securely outside of this code.",
