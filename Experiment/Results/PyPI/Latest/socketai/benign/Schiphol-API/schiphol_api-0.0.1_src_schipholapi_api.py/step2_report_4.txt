  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the class as an API client for Schiphol's public flights API, with user inputs for IDs and parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; requests to external API, responses parsed, printed, and returned.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code. The code prints data, which is typical for debugging but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward API wrapper, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security exploits. The primary concern is the printing of sensitive data, but this is standard and not malicious.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (moderate, mainly due to printing sensitive data, but not malicious)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; API credentials are passed as parameters, used in headers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious actions; only API requests and prints.\n- **Anomalies:** Credentials are accepted as parameters but not validated or masked. Potential misuse if credentials are exposed, but not inherently malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, just standard API client. The main concern is credential handling, but no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (acceptable)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to previous; straightforward API client, no malicious activity.  \n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Again, a standard API wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- Handles errors gracefully, no obfuscation, no secrets hardcoded.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.1 (lower, since minimal concerns)\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar assessment; no malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.  \n- Uses parameters for API keys, no secrets hardcoded.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the reports' findings; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the absence of obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero concern mainly about handling of API credentials and data printing.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven the code's straightforward nature, the lack of obfuscation, and no evidence of malicious intent, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (low, primarily related to credential handling and data exposure via print statements)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with my assessment. The code is a standard, benign API client with minimal security concerns.",
