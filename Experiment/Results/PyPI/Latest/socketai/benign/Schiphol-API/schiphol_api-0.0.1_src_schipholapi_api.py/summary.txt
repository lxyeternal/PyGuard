  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API client for Schiphol's public flight data API. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal, primarily related to credential handling outside this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.1. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
