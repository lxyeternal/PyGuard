  "purpose": "Unit test for SchipholAPI's get_flights method, verifying retrieval of flight data using credentials from environment variables.",
  "sources": "dotenv_values('.env') for credentials; self.api.get_flights() call for data retrieval.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Credentials loaded from environment -> API instantiated -> get_flights() called -> data returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. The mention of a 'JSON parse error' in reports appears to be an external API/library issue, not in the code itself.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard unit test that loads API credentials securely from a .env file, initializes the API client, and calls a method to fetch flight data. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The test expects a specific response structure and count, which is typical. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (~0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior. The mention of a JSON parse error likely relates to external API response issues, not the code itself. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and does not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test with secure credential handling and no malicious or obfuscated content. The low security risk score is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
