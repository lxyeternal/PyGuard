  "purpose": "Unit testing script for SchipholAPI integration, verifying the get_flights method works as expected.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables from a .env file to obtain API credentials.",
  "sinks": "Uses API credentials to initialize SchipholAPI, which makes network requests.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are loaded and passed to SchipholAPI, which then presumably makes external network requests to fetch flight data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; environment variables are used, which is a good practice. No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are observed. The code is straightforward and standard for a unit test.",
  "analysis": "The script loads API credentials from a local .env file via dotenv_values, then initializes the SchipholAPI with these credentials. It contains a unit test to call get_flights and check the response. The code does not perform any data manipulation or include any suspicious code. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security issues are present. The code appears to be a typical testing setup without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for an API client, correctly using environment variables for credentials. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
