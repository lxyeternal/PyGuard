  "purpose": "Unit testing for the SchipholAPI class to verify flight data retrieval functionality.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables from a '.env' file for APP_ID and APP_KEY.",
  "sinks": "Uses the API credentials to initialize SchipholAPI; no untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read, then used to instantiate API client, then method results are checked.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious functions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard unit test setup using environment variables for API credentials, then calls a method to fetch flights and asserts expected results. No external data injection points or malicious behaviors are evident. It leverages standard libraries and practices for testing and environment variable management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, well-structured unit test with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It responsibly uses environment variables for sensitive data and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code.",
