{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test for the SchipholAPI class, specifically testing the get_flights method using credentials stored in a .env file.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables APP_ID and APP_KEY from a .env file using dotenv_values.",
  "targets": "No direct untrusted input is processed or used in a way that could lead to data leaks or code execution; the variables are used for API authentication.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as source inputs, used to instantiate SchipholAPI, which then calls get_flights. The test checks the response for expected structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials (they are stored externally in .env), unusual code structures, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads credentials from an external file, avoiding hardcoded secrets. It performs a straightforward unit test of an API call, verifying that the response is not None and contains 20 flights. There are no suspicious or malicious code behaviors, backdoors, or data exfiltration attempts. The code relies on an external package 'schipholapi' and dotenv for environment management, which is standard practice. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard unit test with secure handling of credentials. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security assessment is very low risk.",
