  "purpose": "Unit testing for the SchipholAPI wrapper, specifically testing the get_flights method.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables from the .env file for API credentials.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code only uses environment variables for configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are loaded and passed as parameters to the API class; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code correctly uses dotenv for configuration, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code loads API credentials from a .env file via dotenv_values, then initializes an API class instance. It performs a simple unit test calling get_flights and asserts the response is valid and has 20 flights. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security issues. Usage of environment variables for secrets is appropriate, and no unsafe operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for an API client with secure handling of secrets. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
