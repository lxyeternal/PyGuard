{
  "purpose": "The code provides a comprehensive database utility framework, including connection management, SQL parsing, dialect-specific query generation, and resource handling, designed to facilitate safe and flexible database interactions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for SQL queries, configuration dictionaries, external SQL script files read via file I/O.",
  "sinks": "SQL execution via SQLAlchemy, data retrieval into SQLRow and SQLRowCollection objects, file reading for SQL scripts.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed and bound into parameterized SQL statements, which are then executed through SQLAlchemy connections, with results encapsulated in custom classes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or backdoors. Use of dynamic SQL string assembly is standard but could pose external risks if inputs are malicious, though not within the code itself.",
  "analysis": "The code employs parameterized queries throughout, reducing injection risks. It manages database connections and transactions properly, reads SQL scripts safely with existence checks, and avoids obfuscation or malicious patterns. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The use of external SQL files and dynamic string assembly introduces typical external risks but not malicious intent. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated as 0, and security risk as approximately 0.2 due to potential external misuse, which is standard for such utilities. Confidence in this assessment is high (~0.9-1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured database utility library with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. The overall security posture is high, with minimal supply chain concern based on the code review.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
