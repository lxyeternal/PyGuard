  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'wacundb' Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'wacundb.__version__', specifies package metadata, and lists dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; dependencies are static strings, no data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Static data from version import and dependency list; no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of newline characters ('\\n') within dependency strings in 'install_requires', which is unconventional and may cause installation issues.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behaviors. The only anomaly is the inclusion of newline characters within dependency strings, which is likely a formatting mistake rather than malicious. No external data handling or network activity is present. The version import assumes a valid '__version__' attribute in the package. Overall, the script is benign, with minor formatting issues that do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The only concern is the formatting anomaly in dependencies, which could affect installation but not security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to the minor formatting issue.",
