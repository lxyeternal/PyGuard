{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'wacundb' Python package, used for distributing and installing the library.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata (__version__, author info, dependencies) and package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause security issues; primarily static configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads metadata and dependencies, but no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses distutils, which is standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration. It imports version info from the package itself and specifies dependencies and metadata. No user input, no dynamic code execution, no network connections, or suspicious behaviors are present. The dependencies are common SQL-related packages, and no secrets or sensitive data are hardcoded.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to define package metadata and dependencies.",
