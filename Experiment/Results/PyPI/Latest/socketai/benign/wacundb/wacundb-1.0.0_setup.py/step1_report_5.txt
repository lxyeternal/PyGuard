  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'wacundb' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__version__' in 'wacundb' module, and static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Uses static data for package configuration; no data flow from external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The 'install_requires' list includes newline characters within strings ('sqlalchemy\\n', 'pymssql\\n', 'pymysql\\n'), which may cause installation issues, but not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration. It imports version info from the package's module, then calls setup() with static metadata. No user input, network activity, or untrusted data sources are present. The only anomaly is the inclusion of newline characters within the 'install_requires' list items, which is likely a typo but not malicious. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script with a minor formatting issue in dependencies. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
