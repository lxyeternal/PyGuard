  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the wacundb Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads package metadata, version info from __version__, and dependency list from install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; the script primarily defines package info and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; dependencies are static strings, version info is imported.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; dependencies are listed plainly. The install_requires strings include newline characters, which may cause issues but not maliciousness.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup script using distutils, importing version info from the package. No code execution or dynamic behavior is present. The dependencies are listed as static strings with embedded newlines, which could cause installation issues but do not indicate malicious activity. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
