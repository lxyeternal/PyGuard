  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the wacundb Python module",
  "sources": "Reads version from __version__ in wacundb, and includes static metadata such as author, email, URL, description, and dependencies",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data; setup process does not handle user input or perform sensitive operations",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static data used for package configuration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using distutils, importing version info from the package. It specifies dependencies and metadata. The dependencies include SQL-related libraries, but are specified as static strings. There are no input sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
