  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The only concern is the formatting anomaly in dependencies, which could affect installation but not security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to the minor formatting issue."
