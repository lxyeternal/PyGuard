{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes related to various data readers from the 'llama_index.readers.oxylabs' module and defines a list of exported classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements for multiple classes from 'llama_index.readers.oxylabs', and a list assignment to '__all__'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; no untrusted data output, network calls, or data processing occurs within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present; the code only performs static imports and exports without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are evident. The code is purely import/export definitions without dynamic or suspicious code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly imports classes from a module and defines an export list. No runtime logic, data handling, or network interactions are present. Since it is purely declarative, it poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The code appears standard for a package's __init__.py or similar module to define public API.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements and an export list. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks within this snippet.",
