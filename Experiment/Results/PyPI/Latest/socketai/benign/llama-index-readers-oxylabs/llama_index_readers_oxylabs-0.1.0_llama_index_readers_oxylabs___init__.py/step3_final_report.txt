{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization or API exposure file, importing specific classes from the 'llama_index.readers.oxylabs' package and defining an __all__ list for symbol exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'llama_index.readers.oxylabs' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, network calls, or data output; static import declarations only.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static symbol definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export list with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements and a symbol list, typical for a module's __init__.py. No dynamic behavior, data handling, or network activity is present. The code is clear, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, as it only exposes class references without executing any logic. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements and symbol exports. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk present. The scores are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
