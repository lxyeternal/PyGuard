  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is only import statements and an export list, with no dynamic behavior or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are both 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; no issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly states that the code is just import/export declarations with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, assigning a confidence of 0.9 and a small security risk score of 0.1, citing potential for future data extraction use.\n- **Potential Concern:** The minor security risk score seems to be based on the possibility that these classes could be used maliciously elsewhere, but in this code snippet, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, which is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The cautious approach is acceptable, but the security risk score might be slightly overstated given the code's static import nature.\n\n**Report 4 & 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Both reports correctly identify that the code is only import statements and an export list, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are both 0; security risk is 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's static, import-only nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0, with one (Report 3) assigning 0.1, citing a very minor potential. Given the code's simplicity, this is an overestimation. The code itself does not pose any security risk.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware:** 0 for all, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's static import nature, I would assign a risk score of **0** across the board, as there is no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is straightforward, benign, and standard for module setup.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- Slight overestimation in Report 3's security risk score, but overall acceptable.\n\n**Final recommendation:** All scores should be **malware: 0**, **obfuscated: 0**, **risk: 0**.",
