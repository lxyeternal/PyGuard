{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific reader classes from the 'llama_index.readers.oxylabs' package and defines a list of publicly accessible symbols for module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements fetching classes from the 'llama_index.readers.oxylabs' package.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data outputs; the code only imports modules and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static imports and symbol exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements from a well-structured package and a list defining the public API of the module. No runtime data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The module's purpose seems to be organizing and exposing specific classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The absence of dynamic code, user input handling, or external network calls further reduces suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an import and export configuration for a set of reader classes. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks based on the provided code fragment.",
