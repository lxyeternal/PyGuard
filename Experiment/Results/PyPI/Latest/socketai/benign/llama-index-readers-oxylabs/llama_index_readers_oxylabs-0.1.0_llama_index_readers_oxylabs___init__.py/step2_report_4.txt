  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code is just import statements and a list of exported symbols. No runtime data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** The conclusion that the code is benign and has no malware or security risks is correct. The confidence is high (1), and the malware score is appropriately 0.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, just import statements and an export list. No dynamic or malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as benign. The confidence is high (1), malware score 0.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Same pattern—imports and export list, no data flow or suspicious behavior. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a minimal security risk score (0.1), which seems reasonable given the lack of dynamic behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. No signs of malware or obfuscation.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard import/export module setup, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly assessed as benign, confidence 1, malware 0.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Again, straightforward import statements and export list. No data processing or network activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate conclusion.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Presence:** The code is purely import statements and a symbol list.  \n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.  \n- **Security Risks:** None evident; the minimal risk score in Report 3 is appropriate given the context.  \n- **Scores Consistency:** All scores align with the code's nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 for all, as no malicious activity is present.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 or very close to it; the minimal risk in Report 3 is justified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code fragment is a benign module setup with no security concerns.",
