  "purpose": "A class to fetch Google Ads data via Oxylabs API using provided credentials.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: username and password during initialization; payloads in get_response and aget_response methods.",
  "sinks": "Calls to self.oxylabs_api.google.scrape_ads and self.async_oxylabs_api.google.scrape_ads, which send data to the Oxylabs API endpoint.",
  "flows": "Initialization with credentials → methods accepting payloads → calls to API functions with payload data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. Usage of API methods appears standard; no obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of OxylabsGoogleBaseReader, intended to retrieve Google Ads data using provided credentials. The credentials are passed at initialization, and API calls are made with supplied payloads. The methods are straightforward wrappers around API calls. No input validation, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling is present. The API interaction appears to be standard, with no indications of malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The code relies on external API objects, which are not shown but are assumed to be standard API client instances.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API client wrapper with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It performs standard API calls with user-supplied data, and no suspicious behavior is evident.",
