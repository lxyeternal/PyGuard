  "purpose": "A class to retrieve Google Ads data using Oxylabs API, inheriting from a base Google scraper.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as username, password, and payload data used in API calls.",
  "sinks": "API call methods 'scrape_ads' which send data to Oxylabs server.",
  "flows": "User provides credentials and payload -> class methods invoke API calls with payload data -> response returned from Oxylabs API.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. Credentials are passed as parameters, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass for scraping Google Ads data, utilizing API methods from external Oxylabs modules. It accepts credentials and payloads and performs API calls, both synchronously and asynchronously. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. The use of API credentials and external API calls is standard and expected. No suspicious code patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper class for retrieving Google Ads data from Oxylabs. No malicious behavior or security risks identified. It functions as intended for data retrieval with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
