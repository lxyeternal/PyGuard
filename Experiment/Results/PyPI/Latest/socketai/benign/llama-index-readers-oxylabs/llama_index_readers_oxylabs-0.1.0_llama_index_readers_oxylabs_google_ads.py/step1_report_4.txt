{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for fetching Google Ads data using the Oxylabs API, extending a base reader class.",
  "sources": "Input data such as username, password, and payload parameters for API calls.",
  "sinks": "API call methods that send data to the Oxylabs service; potential for data leakage if credentials are mishandled.",
  "flows": "Credentials and parameters flow from class instantiation and method calls into the API request functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no suspicious or malicious code behavior; straightforward use of API calls.",
  "analysis": "The class inherits from a base reader, initializes with username and password, and provides methods to perform synchronous and asynchronous API calls to scrape Google Ads data. There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious code, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a data fetcher with proper parameter passing. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a data retrieval class from a third-party API, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external credentials and API endpoints, which are expected for its function.",
