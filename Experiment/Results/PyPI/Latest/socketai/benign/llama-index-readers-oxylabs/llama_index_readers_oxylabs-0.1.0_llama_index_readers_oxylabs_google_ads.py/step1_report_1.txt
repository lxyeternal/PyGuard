  "purpose": "Define a class for retrieving Google Ads data via Oxylabs API, extending a base reader.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as username, password, and payload data used in API calls.",
  "sinks": "API call methods 'scrape_ads' which send data to an external service; usage of credentials.",
  "flows": "Construction of class with credentials -> calling 'get_response' or 'agets_response' -> API request to Oxylabs service with payload.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated code, no malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass that handles API interactions for Google Ads data collection. It takes username and password as initialization parameters, passing them to the superclass. The methods 'get_response' and 'agets_response' invoke external API calls, which are standard for such data retrieval. No suspicious or malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads, is present. Use of credentials appears to be proper, assuming secure handling outside this snippet. The code does not contain any malicious behavior or malware indicators. The external API call could be a point of concern if misused, but in this context, it is a legitimate data collection function.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a data retrieval class interacting with an external API. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malware within this snippet. The security risk is low, provided that credentials are handled securely outside this code.",
