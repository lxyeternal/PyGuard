  "purpose": "API wrapper class for retrieving Google Ads data via Oxylabs API.",
  "sources": "username and password parameters during initialization, external API call methods.",
  "sinks": "external API endpoints invoked in get_response and aget_response methods.",
  "flows": "Initialization with credentials -> method call to scrape_ads with payload -> external API response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; straightforward API wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of OxylabsGoogleBaseReader, adding methods to fetch Google Ads data via API calls. Credentials are passed as parameters, not hardcoded. The methods invoke external API functions without data manipulation or malicious behavior. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's structure and purpose are standard for API clients. Scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature and functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward API wrapper with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. Credentials are handled securely via parameters, and external API calls are standard for data collection. The overall security risk is minimal.",
