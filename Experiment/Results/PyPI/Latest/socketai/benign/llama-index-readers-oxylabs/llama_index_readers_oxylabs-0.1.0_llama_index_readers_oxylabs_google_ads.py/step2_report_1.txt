  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the reported issues, scores, and conclusions.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward subclass wrapping API calls to Oxylabs for Google Ads data.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.\n   - The code's purpose and flow are standard for API wrappers.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable considering the code handles credentials and makes external API calls. The low scores reflect minimal inherent risk in this snippet.\n   \n   The scores seem consistent and justified based on the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.2, which is appropriate.\n   - The low risk scores are justified because:\n     - Credentials are passed as parameters, not hardcoded.\n     - No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n     - External API calls are standard for such data collection.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - Since there is no evidence of malicious behavior, the malware score of 0 is justified.\n   - The code does not perform any data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume proper handling of credentials outside this snippet, which is reasonable.\n   - The API calls are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's analysis.\n   - No anomalies or inconsistencies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal inherent security risk, primarily due to credential handling and external API interaction.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, standard API wrapper for retrieving Google Ads data via Oxylabs. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal risk associated with external API calls and credential handling)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe based on the provided snippet.",
