{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for retrieving Google Ads data using Oxylabs API, primarily for web scraping purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters (payload) and class initialization (username, password).",
  "sinks": "Uses the oxylabs_api and async_oxylabs_api to call scrape_ads, which may send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input payload is passed to API methods, leading to network requests to Oxylabs' endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code properly initializes an API client with username and password, then provides methods to fetch data asynchronously or synchronously. It relies on external API calls for scraping Google Ads data. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code appears to be a straightforward API wrapper class without any obfuscation or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an API client wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It securely manages credentials through parameters and makes network requests to a reputable service. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
