  "purpose": "A class for retrieving YouTube video transcripts via Oxylabs API.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as username, password, and payload for API calls.",
  "sinks": "API call functions: scrape_transcript via self.oxylabs_api and self.async_oxylabs_api.",
  "flows": "Initialization with credentials -> get_response or aget_response -> API call with payload.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code structures, no obfuscation, no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The class inherits from a base reader and facilitates synchronous and asynchronous API calls to fetch YouTube transcripts. Credentials (username and password) are passed during initialization but are not hardcoded, and are used for API authentication. The API calls are made via attributes that likely interface with Oxylabs' web scraper API. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious code, or suspicious network activity within this code. The code appears to be a straightforward API wrapper designed for legitimate data retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate API client for obtaining YouTube transcripts. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. The use of credentials is standard, and there are no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code. Overall, it appears safe and intended for its purpose.",
