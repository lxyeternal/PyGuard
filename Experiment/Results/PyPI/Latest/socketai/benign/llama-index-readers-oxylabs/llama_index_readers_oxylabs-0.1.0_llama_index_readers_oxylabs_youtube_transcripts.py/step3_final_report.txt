  "purpose": "API wrapper class for retrieving YouTube transcripts via Oxylabs API.",
  "sources": "Credentials (username, password) passed during initialization; API call parameters in get_response and aget_response methods.",
  "sinks": "External API calls to scrape_transcript; potential data leakage if payloads contain sensitive info, but standard for API wrappers.",
  "flows": "Initialization with credentials -> get_response/aget_response with payload -> API call to scrape_transcript with payload data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures; straightforward API wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code is a clear, standard API client for YouTube transcript retrieval, accepting credentials at runtime, and making external API calls. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The scores from reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The only minor concern is credential handling, which is typical and not inherently risky. External API security depends on the API provider, outside the scope of this code. Overall, the code is safe and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward API wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given credential handling and external API reliance. No adjustments are necessary; the reports are accurate and consistent.",
