  "purpose": "Define a base class for Oxylabs web scraper that handles responses and data loading.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for 'load_data' and 'aload_data', response data from 'get_response' and 'aget_response' methods.",
  "sinks": "Processing of response data in '_validate_response' and '_get_document_from_response'; potential for unvalidated data handling.",
  "flows": "Response data flows from 'get_response'/'aget_response' to '_validate_response' to '_get_document_from_response' and finally to Document text.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external libraries 'oxylabs' with API keys provided during instantiation; no hardcoded credentials; no evident obfuscation; response validation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for Oxylabs web scraper, initializing API clients with user-provided credentials. The response validation method '_validate_response' carefully checks the structure of the response, unpacking nested 'results'. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data handling found. No malicious behavior or backdoors. External API keys are supplied at runtime, which is normal. The use of external libraries 'RealtimeClient' and 'AsyncClient' does not inherently imply malicious intent. No suspicious code flows or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of a scraper base class, with proper response validation and no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles data securely, relying on user-supplied credentials and external libraries for API communication. Overall, it does not exhibit malware or security risks.",
