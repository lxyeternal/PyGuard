  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward API wrapper class, passing credentials and payloads to Oxylabs API methods. There are no indications of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code's logic aligns with standard practices for such API clients.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that no suspicious or malicious behaviors are present. They mention that credentials are passed via constructor parameters, which is typical, and that the API calls use provided payloads without evident data leaks or backdoors.  \n   No factual errors or logical flaws are apparent in the reports. They seem consistent and well-reasoned.\n\n3. **Scores Review**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, no obfuscation detected.  \n   - **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, no malware behaviors are identified.  \n   - **Security Risk (0.2)**: Slightly conservative but acceptable, considering the code handles credentials and makes external API calls.  \n   - **Confidence (0.9)**: Justified given the thorough reasoning.  \n   \n   The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all scores are at or below 0.2 for malware and security risk, no higher scores are necessary. The code does not exhibit behaviors warranting elevated risk levels.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification**:  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions—no data exfiltration, obfuscation, or suspicious API calls. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not rely on unwarranted assumptions. They recognize that payloads are passed to API methods, which could contain malicious data, but that is outside the scope of this code review. They correctly identify the code as a legitimate API wrapper.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   All scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score**: **0.2** (low, standard API wrapper security consideration)\n\n**Overall, the code appears legitimate, with no security risks or malware concerns.**",
