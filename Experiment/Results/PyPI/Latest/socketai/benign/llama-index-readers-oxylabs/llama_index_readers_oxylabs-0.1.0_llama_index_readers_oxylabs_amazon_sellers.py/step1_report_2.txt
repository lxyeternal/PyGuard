  "purpose": "A class designed to fetch data about Amazon sellers using Oxylabs API.",
  "sources": "Reads 'username' and 'password' during initialization; receives 'payload' as input for response methods.",
  "sinks": "Calls API methods 'scrape_sellers' with provided payload; no direct data output or external data storage.",
  "flows": "Initialization stores credentials; 'get_response' and 'aget_response' send payloads to API methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual code structures; standard API call pattern.",
  "analysis": "The class securely stores user credentials but passes them directly to API calls without sanitization or encryption, which is typical for such API wrappers. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The API calls rely on the payload provided; potential security concern is if payload contains malicious data, but that is outside the scope of this code. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious loops, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API wrapper class for retrieving data about Amazon sellers. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident within this isolated code fragment.",
