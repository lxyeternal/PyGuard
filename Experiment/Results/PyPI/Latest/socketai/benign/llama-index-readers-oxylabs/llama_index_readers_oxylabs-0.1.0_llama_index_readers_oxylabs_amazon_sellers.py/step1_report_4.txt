{
  "purpose": "Define a class for retrieving Amazon seller data using Oxylabs API.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'username', 'password', and 'payload' for API requests.",
  "sinks": "API call methods 'scrape_sellers' with payload data, potentially passing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Constructor passes credentials; 'get_response' and 'agett_response' send payloads to API methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior; use of standard API call patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that interacts with Oxylabs' API to scrape Amazon seller data, passing credentials via constructor and making API requests with provided payloads. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The use of credentials in the constructor indicates expected behavior for authorized API access. The API calls seem standard and do not involve insecure practices. No suspicious data flows or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper class for accessing Amazon seller data through Oxylabs. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It is a typical implementation of an API client with no suspicious elements.",
