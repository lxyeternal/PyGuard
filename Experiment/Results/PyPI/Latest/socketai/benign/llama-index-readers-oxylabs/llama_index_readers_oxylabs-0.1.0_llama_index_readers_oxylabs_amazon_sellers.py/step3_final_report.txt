  "purpose": "API wrapper class for fetching Amazon seller data via Oxylabs API, passing credentials and payloads to external API methods.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (username, password), payload argument in get_response and aget_response methods.",
  "sinks": "API call methods (scrape_sellers) with payloads, which could contain untrusted data; credentials used during initialization.",
  "flows": "Credentials flow from constructor to superclass; payloads flow into API methods; data is sent over network via API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward API wrapper behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class extending a base API client, passing credentials during initialization and making API calls with provided payloads. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The code's structure and logic are standard for such API wrappers. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk=0.2 are appropriate given the benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The high confidence score (0.9) reflects certainty of benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward API client wrapper with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are consistent and justified, indicating a low security risk and no malware presence.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
