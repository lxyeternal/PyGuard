  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a straightforward recursive data formatter converting JSON-like Python objects into Markdown.\n- They consistently note the absence of external system calls, network operations, or data leaks.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are also 0 across all reports, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Code's Behavior:\n- The code processes various data types safely.\n- It handles nested structures correctly.\n- String handling for multiline data uses standard string replacement.\n- No external inputs, outputs, or system interactions are present.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, safe, and purely focused on data formatting.\n\n---\n\n### Issues in the Reports:\n- **Logical/Reasoning Flaws:** None detected. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk):** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n### Notable Observations:\n- The only minor point is the handling of multiline strings with `replace('\\n', '\\n' + indent + '> ')`. While this is standard for markdown blockquotes, it does not introduce any security risk.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The **malware score** remains **0** because there is no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains **0** because the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The **risk score** remains **0** due to the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**This aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of all reports.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a safe, well-structured utility for converting JSON-like data into Markdown. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
