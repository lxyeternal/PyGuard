  "purpose": "The function converts a Python object (such as parsed JSON data) into a Markdown formatted string, with support for nested structures like dicts and lists.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'data' which is the Python object to convert.",
  "sinks": "String concatenation and formatting operations where the Markdown output is built.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through type checks, recursive calls, and string formatting to produce Markdown output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard recursion and string manipulation without any obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard type-based processing of input data, converting dicts and lists into Markdown syntax with nested headers and lists. It carefully handles multiline strings, appending markdown blockquotes for multiline strings. No data leaks, system commands, or insecure operations are present. There are no external system interactions, no network calls, and no sensitive data handling. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for converting JSON-like data into Markdown format. It performs safe, straightforward data formatting without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
