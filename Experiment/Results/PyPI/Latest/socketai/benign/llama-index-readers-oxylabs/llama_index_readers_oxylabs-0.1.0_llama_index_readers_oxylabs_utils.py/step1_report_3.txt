{
  "purpose": "The code converts a Python object (such as JSON data) into a Markdown-formatted string, handling nested structures recursively.",
  "sources": "Data input through the 'data' parameter; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "String concatenations and recursive calls for data processing; no external data sinks or untrusted output destinations.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed recursively; data types are checked and converted to Markdown accordingly; no external data flows or malicious payloads detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; the code performs standard data formatting with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The function performs a straightforward recursive conversion of data structures into Markdown. It handles dictionaries, lists, strings, and basic data types appropriately, with no signs of malicious code. There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or insecure operations. The handling of string data with embedded newlines uses string replacement but no unsafe evaluation or injection. The code is clean, well-structured, and consistent with normal data formatting tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to format data into Markdown. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a standard utility function with no security concerns.",
