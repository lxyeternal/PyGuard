{
  "purpose": "The code converts a Python object, typically derived from JSON data, into a formatted Markdown string, supporting nested structures and various data types.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the input parameter 'data', which can be any Python object, especially JSON-like structures such as dicts, lists, strings, numbers, booleans, or None.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs Markdown-formatted strings; no untrusted data is written to external systems or files. There are no network or file sinks that could leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the 'data' parameter, through recursive processing, into string parts stored in 'markdown_parts', which are concatenated into the final Markdown string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code primarily handles data formatting with standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward recursive data formatter converting JSON-like data structures into Markdown. It uses recursion, type checks, string manipulations, and conditional formatting. No external system calls, network operations, or data leaks are present. The function processes input data into a human-readable Markdown format, which is safe and benign. The code is well-structured with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data formatting utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply transforms structured data into Markdown, with no evidence of sabotage or malware. The overall security risk is minimal.",
