{
  "purpose": "The function converts a Python data structure (typically from JSON) into a Markdown-formatted string, supporting nested structures and different data types.",
  "sources": "Reads input data via the 'data' parameter; no other external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Outputs Markdown string; no untrusted data is written to external systems or files within this code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through recursive processing, converting nested structures into Markdown format, but no untrusted data manipulation occurs beyond formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior detected. The code does not perform network operations, file IO, or execute dynamic code. The use of string replace for handling newlines is standard for markdown formatting.",
  "analysis": "The function performs recursive data conversion with clear handling of dicts, lists, strings, and basic data types. It uses safe string formatting and standard Python features. No hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or external system interactions are present. The structure and logic are straightforward and typical for data formatting. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard recursive data-to-Markdown converter with no malicious or security-threatening behaviors. It is safe for use in a broader application context.",
