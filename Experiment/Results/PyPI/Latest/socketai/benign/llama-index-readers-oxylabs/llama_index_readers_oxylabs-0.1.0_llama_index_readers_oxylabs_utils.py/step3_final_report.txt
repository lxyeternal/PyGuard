  "purpose": "Convert JSON-like Python data structures into Markdown format with proper nesting, headers, and list formatting.",
  "sources": "The input data parameter 'data' which can be dicts, lists, strings, numbers, booleans, or None.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs a Markdown string; no external sinks or data leaks are involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'data' parameter through recursive calls, formatted into Markdown parts, and concatenated into a string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward recursive formatter converting JSON-like data into Markdown with headers, indentation, and blockquotes for multiline strings. It handles various data types safely, with no external system calls, network activity, or data leaks. String replacement for multiline strings is standard and safe. The logic is clear, and no suspicious patterns or malicious intent are present. The code's purpose is purely data formatting, and the implementation is standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility for converting JSON data into Markdown. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
