  "purpose": "A base class for processing structured response data into text snippets, primarily converting nested dictionaries and lists into formatted strings for documentation or display.",
  "sources": "Response data structures (list of dicts or list of list of dicts), recursive data structures within the response content.",
  "sinks": "String snippets appended to a list, ultimately joined into a single string; no external system interactions or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Response data is recursively traversed; data flows from input structures into formatted string snippets via recursive collector functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The recursive functions could, in theory, be exploited for resource exhaustion if fed maliciously crafted deeply nested data, but this is a common and acknowledged risk in recursive processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard data processing utility designed for extension. It includes placeholder methods intended for subclass implementation, with no external calls, network activity, or malicious behavior. The recursive data traversal functions incorporate depth limits to prevent infinite recursion. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present. The primary security concern is potential resource exhaustion from maliciously crafted nested data, which is a typical risk in recursive algorithms but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured response processing class with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The slight security risk associated with recursion depth is acknowledged but not indicative of malicious behavior. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to potential resource exhaustion in edge cases.",
