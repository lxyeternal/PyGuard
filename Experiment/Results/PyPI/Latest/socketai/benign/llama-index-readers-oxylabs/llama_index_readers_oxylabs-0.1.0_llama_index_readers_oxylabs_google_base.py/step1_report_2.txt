{
  "purpose": "This code defines a base class and helper methods for processing responses from the Oxylabs API related to search results, transforming nested response data into text snippets for further use.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily read from method parameters such as 'response' in '_get_document_from_response' and 'payload' in 'get_response' and 'agget_response'. The code reads from response dictionaries, response list structures, and method arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include methods that process and concatenate data into strings (e.g., '_recursive_snippet_collector', '_create_*_snippets' methods), but no untrusted data is directly written to files, network, or system calls within the code shown. The code constructs text representations of data, which could be misused if malicious data is fed in, but no harmful operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input response data structures through recursive collection and processing functions, transforming nested data into text snippets. No external system or network interactions are present that could be exploited, and there are no direct execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are observed. The code primarily deals with data processing and formatting. No suspicious network activity or malicious behavior is detected. The 'get_response' and 'agget_response' methods are placeholders raising NotImplementedError, indicating design for subclasses.",
  "analysis": "The code processes nested response data structures to generate human-readable snippets. It includes recursive functions for handling nested dictionaries and lists, with controls on depth and content. No execution of untrusted code, system calls, or network interactions are present. The code appears focused on data formatting and organization, with no signs of malicious intent. The presence of placeholder methods suggests this is a framework meant to be extended by subclasses, not malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a structured data processing module with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It simply transforms API response data into formatted text snippets. No malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows are detected. The code appears safe and intended for legitimate use in response parsing.",
