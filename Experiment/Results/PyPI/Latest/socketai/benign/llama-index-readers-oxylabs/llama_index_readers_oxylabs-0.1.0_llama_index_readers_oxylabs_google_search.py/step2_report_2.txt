  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Backdoors:**  \n   All reports explicitly state that there are no suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code patterns. The code is described as a straightforward API wrapper, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. This aligns with the original code, which is a class wrapping API calls with no internal data manipulation or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the class accepts credentials and payloads, passing them directly to external API calls. There are no logical errors or code flaws apparent. The code's structure and purpose are consistent with a typical API client wrapper.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Issues:**  \n   - Malware score: all reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - Security risk: scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns, mainly about credential handling outside this code.  \n   - Obfuscated score: 0, which is accurate.\n\n4. **Claims about Potential Vulnerabilities:**  \n   The reports do not assume vulnerabilities without basis. They recognize that payloads are passed directly to API calls, which could be a concern if payloads are untrusted, but this is typical for API wrappers and not inherently insecure.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores with the Analysis:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed reasoning: no malware, no obfuscation, low security risk, and standard API interaction.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — Very low, mainly due to external credential handling considerations.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a legitimate API wrapper for Oxylabs, used for web scraping.\n- No evidence suggests any security threat or malicious intent.\n- Proper credential management outside this code is essential but outside the scope of this review.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe original code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided information. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to external credential handling, but overall very low risk)",
