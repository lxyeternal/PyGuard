  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code appears to be a straightforward API wrapper class that interfaces with Oxylabs' Google search API.\n   - It accepts credentials during initialization and passes payloads directly to API methods.\n   - No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n   - The external API calls are standard for web scraping and proxy services.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is a simple API wrapper.\n   - They appropriately note that payloads are passed directly to API calls, which could be untrusted input, but this is typical.\n   - No false positives or overlooked issues are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: around 0.1 to 0.2\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the code's nature as a simple API wrapper with no malicious content.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are low, reflecting minimal inherent risk.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2.\n   - The code itself does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities.\n   - The only potential concern is the handling of credentials and payloads, but these are standard and not inherently risky if managed properly outside this code.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0, which aligns with the code's analysis.\n   - No malicious behavior or intent is evident.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is a wrapper for API calls.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, low security risk.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, mainly related to external API interactions and credential handling outside this snippet.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a legitimate, straightforward API wrapper for Oxylabs' Google search API. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is very low. Proper management of credentials outside this code is essential but not a flaw within the code itself.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                     |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1                   |\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
