  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to identify any inconsistencies or overlooked issues.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious Behavior or Backdoors:**  \nAll reports consistently state that there are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is a straightforward wrapper around external API calls, passing credentials and payloads directly. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.\n\n**2. Code Functionality and Data Flow:**  \nThe code initializes with username and password, which are passed to a superclass. The get_response and aget_response methods invoke external API functions with user-provided payloads. This pattern is typical for API wrappers and does not inherently introduce security risks.\n\n**3. Potential Risks or Flaws:**  \n- **Handling of Credentials:** Credentials are passed during class instantiation and sent to the parent class. If the parent class handles them securely, this is acceptable. However, if credentials are stored insecurely or logged, that could be a concern, but this is outside the scope of the provided code.\n- **Payload Data:** Payloads are passed directly to API calls, which could include untrusted data. This is standard for such wrappers, but the security depends on how the payloads are constructed and sanitized outside this code.\n- **External API Calls:** The code relies on external API objects (`self.oxylabs_api` and `self.async_oxylabs_api`). The security of these depends on their implementation, which is not provided. Assuming they are legitimate and secure, this is acceptable.\n\n**4. Scores and Justifications:**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code clarity.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal risk primarily associated with handling credentials and untrusted payloads, which is standard for API wrappers.\n\n**5. Recommendations for Score Adjustments:**  \n- The scores seem appropriate given the analysis. No adjustments are necessary unless external factors (like insecure credential storage outside this code) are considered.\n\n**6. Final Assessment:**  \nBased on the code and reports, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The code is a typical API client wrapper, with security considerations mainly outside its scope.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (low, mainly related to credential handling, which is standard and outside the code's scope)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, legitimate, and does not pose security concerns based on the provided information.",
