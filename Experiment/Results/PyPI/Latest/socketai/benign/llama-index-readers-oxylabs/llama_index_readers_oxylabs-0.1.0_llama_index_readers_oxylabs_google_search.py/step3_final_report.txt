{
  "purpose": "API wrapper class for retrieving Google search results via Oxylabs API, passing credentials and payloads to external API calls.",
  "sources": "Credentials provided during initialization; payloads passed directly to API methods.",
  "sinks": "External API calls with untrusted payloads; credentials used in API authentication.",
  "flows": "Credentials flow from class instantiation to API authentication; payloads flow from method calls to external API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard API wrapper that accepts credentials and payloads, passing them directly to external API methods. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature. External API reliance is typical; security depends on external handling of credentials and payloads. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are apparent within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign API client wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
