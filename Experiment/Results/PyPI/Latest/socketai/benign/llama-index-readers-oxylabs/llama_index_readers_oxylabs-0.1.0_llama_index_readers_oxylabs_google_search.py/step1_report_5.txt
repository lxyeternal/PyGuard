  "purpose": "A class for fetching Google Search results using Oxylabs API.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the constructor (username, password), and payloads to get_response and aget_response methods.",
  "sinks": "The calls to self.oxylabs_api.google.scrape_search and self.async_oxylabs_api.google.scrape_search with payload data.",
  "flows": "Payload data passed to get_response or aget_response flows into the API call methods, which may include untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code. Use of API credentials passed via constructor could pose security risks if not managed properly, but this is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that extends a base class for Google search scraping via Oxylabs API. The constructor accepts username and password, which are passed to the parent class. The get_response and aget_response methods call API endpoints with provided payloads. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The API call methods could process untrusted payload data, but this is typical for API clients. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. The code primarily acts as a wrapper for API calls.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client wrapper for fetching Google search results via Oxylabs. No malicious behavior, malware, or suspicious anomalies are evident. Proper security depends on how credentials are managed outside this code. Overall, it poses low security risk.",
