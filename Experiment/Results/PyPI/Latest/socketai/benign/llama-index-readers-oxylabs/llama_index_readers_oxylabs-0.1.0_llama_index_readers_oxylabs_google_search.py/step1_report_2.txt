{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for reading Google Search results via Oxylabs API, facilitating data retrieval from Google's search engine.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters, specifically 'payload' for API calls.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'self.oxylabs_api.google.scrape_search' with payload data, which may include untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input payloads are passed directly to the API call methods, potentially transmitting untrusted data to external API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed. Methods are straightforward API wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a class inheriting from a base, initializing with username and password, and providing methods to retrieve search results via API calls. No data processing, injection, or malicious operations are evident. It acts as a simple wrapper around external API calls, with payloads passed directly from caller input. No suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API wrapper for retrieving Google search data via Oxylabs, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly serves as an interface to external services without processing sensitive data internally.",
