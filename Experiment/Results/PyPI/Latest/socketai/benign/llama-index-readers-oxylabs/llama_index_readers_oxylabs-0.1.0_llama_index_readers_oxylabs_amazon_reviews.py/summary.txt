  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign and correctly implemented for its purpose. The 'Empty response' errors are external or operational issues, not indicative of malicious behavior. Enhancing error handling and response validation is recommended but does not alter the security assessment. Scores should reflect low malware and obfuscation risk, with a modest risk score due to lack of response validation."
