  "purpose": "Define a reader class to fetch Amazon search data via Oxylabs API.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'username', 'password', and 'payload' for API calls.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'scrape_search' method with untrusted payload data.",
  "flows": "Constructor passes credentials; 'get_response' and 'agets_response' pass payload to API methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no unusual code patterns; uses standard API call structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that inherits from a base reader and provides methods to fetch data from an API using provided credentials and payload. Credentials are passed during initialization, and payloads are used for API requests. No data leaks, code injection, or obfuscation observed. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a straightforward API wrapper for data retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API client class designed for web scraping purposes. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. It relies on external API methods which are assumed to be secure. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
