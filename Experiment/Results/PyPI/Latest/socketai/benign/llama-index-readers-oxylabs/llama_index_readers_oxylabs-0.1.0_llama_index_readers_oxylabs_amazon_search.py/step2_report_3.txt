  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and underlying logic.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward API wrapper for Oxylabs' Amazon search scraping.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are detected.\n- The code's primary function is to pass credentials and payloads to external API calls.\n- The API functions (scrape_search) are external and presumed legitimate.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code presence:\n- The code snippets are present in all reports, and their logic matches the description.\n- The methods `get_response` and `aget_response` simply call external API functions with the provided payloads.\n- Credentials are passed during object instantiation and are used in API calls; no hardcoded secrets.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No coding errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The code does not perform any data validation or sanitization on `payload`, but this is typical for API wrappers; validation likely occurs within the API functions.\n- No issues with asynchronous handling are observed.\n- No logical flaws or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern over credential handling and network calls. Given the code's nature, these are acceptable.\n\n### Justification for scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a malware or obfuscated score above 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are low, consistent with the code's purpose and structure.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The only minor concern could be the transmission of credentials, but this is standard for API clients.\n- The payload data could be untrusted, but this is typical for web scraping tools; the responsibility for validation lies with the API or the user.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's analysis and the lack of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (average of reports, acceptable given the context)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a standard API wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.\n- Credential handling is typical and not inherently risky.\n- External API functions are presumed legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code, typical for an API client used in web scraping contexts.",
