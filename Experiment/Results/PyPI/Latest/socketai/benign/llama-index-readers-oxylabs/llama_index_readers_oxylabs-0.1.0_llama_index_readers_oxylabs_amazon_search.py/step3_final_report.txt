  "purpose": "A wrapper class for the Oxylabs API to scrape Amazon search data, managing credentials and API calls.",
  "sources": "Credentials provided during initialization; payloads passed to API functions.",
  "sinks": "API functions (`scrape_search`) which transmit data over the network.",
  "flows": "Credentials flow from class instantiation to API calls; payloads flow from method calls to API functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward API wrapper with no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, clear wrapper around external API functions, handling credentials securely and passing payloads directly. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The API calls are standard for web scraping, with no signs of malicious activity or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. No logical flaws or security issues are evident. The code's purpose is legitimate, and the data flow is typical for such API clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API wrapper with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect the low security risk and lack of malicious behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
