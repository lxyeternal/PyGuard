  "purpose": "Sets up a logging configuration with custom formatters, filters, and handlers for console and file output, ensuring structured and filtered logging.",
  "sources": "LOG_FILE constant import, logging module functions, filter classes accessing log messages.",
  "sinks": "Console output via StreamHandler, file output via FileHandler.",
  "flows": "Log messages are formatted, filtered, and directed to console and file handlers; filters exclude specific messages based on content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; filters and formatters are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard logging setup with custom formatting and filtering. It imports a LOG_FILE constant, applies filters to suppress specific messages, and adds handlers for console and file logging. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious code is present. The filters are benign, designed to suppress duplicate or specific log messages. The formatters and handlers are typical, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The code's purpose is purely for structured logging, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging configuration with custom formatting and filtering. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0.0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
