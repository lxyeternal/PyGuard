{
  "purpose": "Set up custom logging configuration for an application, including console and file handlers with specific formatting and filters.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules (logging, pathlib, warnings), and uses constants from 'colab_easy_ui.const'. No user input or external data sources are directly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to console and file; potential for logging sensitive data if such data is passed to log messages, but no explicit handling of untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "Code defines custom formatters and filters, then applies them to logger instances; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The filters and formatters are standard customizations.",
  "analysis": "The code configures a logger with specific formatting, custom filters, and handlers for console and file outputs. Filters are used to suppress logs or exclude certain messages based on filename. No input handling or external data processing is present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of structured logging setup without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging setup with custom formatting and filtering. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The only potential concern is if logs contain sensitive data, but there is no explicit handling of such data here. Overall, the code is safe.",
