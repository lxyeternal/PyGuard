{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a custom logging configuration for an application, including custom formatting, filtering, and handlers for console and file logging.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration variables such as LOG_FILE from an imported module, and processes log messages generated during application runtime.",
  "sinks": "Log messages are sent to the console and to a specified log file. No untrusted input is directly processed or transmitted within this code.",
  "flows": "Logs are generated and formatted; then they are routed through console and file handlers, with some filters applied to suppress specific logs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. The filters and handlers are standard for logging purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom formatters and filters for logging, setting up a logger with console and file handlers. It uses imported configuration variables and standard logging practices. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. The filters are benign, used for log suppression. The code appears to be a standard logging setup without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code, malware, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided fragment.",
