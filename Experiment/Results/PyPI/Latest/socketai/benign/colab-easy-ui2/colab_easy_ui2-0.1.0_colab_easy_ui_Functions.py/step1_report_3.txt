{
  "purpose": "Define and manage a set of API functions with status tracking and information retrieval for a web service.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters, data from API requests (task_id, status, data), and potentially external function calls.",
  "sinks": "Response outputs via JSONResponse, data stored in self.status_store, and encoded JSON data sent over HTTP responses.",
  "flows": "API input (task_id, status, data) -> stored in self.status_store; function info and task status data -> JSON responses via jsonable_encoder.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval-like dynamic registration of functions (but not inherently malicious); no hardcoded secrets; no suspicious domain or network activity present; no code injection or eval statements observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages API route registration and status tracking in a web application context using FastAPI. It dynamically adds routes for functions, stores task statuses, and returns structured JSON responses. There are no signs of malicious code such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Data flows are controlled, and no insecure code patterns like unsanitized input processing or unsafe eval usage are present. The only potential concern is the dynamic addition of API routes, but this is a standard practice here and not inherently malicious. Overall, the code is focused on API management and does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, focused on API route registration and status management without any malicious intent or suspicious activity. No security risks are evident from the provided code.",
