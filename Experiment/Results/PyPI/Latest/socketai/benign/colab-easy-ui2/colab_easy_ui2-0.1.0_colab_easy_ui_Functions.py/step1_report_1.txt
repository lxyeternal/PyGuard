{
  "purpose": "Defines a FastAPI-based system to register and manage API functions, their statuses, and related responses, primarily for handling asynchronous tasks and function information retrieval.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for API endpoints (task_id, status, data), function definitions with their paths and methods, and internal data structures like self.status_store.",
  "sinks": "Response generation using jsonable_encoder and JSONResponse, internal data manipulations, and dynamic route registrations. No direct data sinks involve untrusted inputs reaching sensitive system parts.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (task_id, status, data) flow into set_task_status; function definitions (func.path, func.func) are registered into the router; get_task_status retrieves data from self.status_store; get_function_info reads function details; responses flow from internal data to API responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code uses standard FastAPI constructs. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed. No obfuscated or dynamically executed code segments. Exception handling in get_function_info logs errors but does not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a management system for API functions and their task statuses, with endpoints for registration, status retrieval, and deletion. It uses standard Python and FastAPI patterns without suspicious constructs. The data flow is controlled, and there are no evident code injections or malicious data leaks. Exception handling is minimal and non-malicious. All data manipulations appear safe, with no signs of obfuscated or harmful code. No external network calls, reverse shells, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API management module without malicious intent. It manages function registrations and task statuses securely. No malicious behaviors or security risks are detected. It appears safe for use, with no evident supply chain security issues.",
