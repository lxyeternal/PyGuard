  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a FastAPI app managing server startup, middleware, static files, and file uploads. Sources are request data, environment variables, and file uploads via `EasyFileUploader`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of data leakage; data flows through standard request handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. Use of threading and uvicorn is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears legitimate with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, risk is low (0.2).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues found. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on server setup, logging, and static file serving.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows; logs and responses are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets; the commented code is benign.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard code, high confidence (0.9). Malware is 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Sets up a server with middleware, static files, and plugin registration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Request data flows through middleware; no malicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Threading and port management are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard setup, confidence 0.9. Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar server setup with internal fetchers and static files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Typical data flow; no malicious activities.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Commented code is inactive.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence (1). Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard server with static files and file upload.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flows; standard request handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets; dynamic port selection is safe. Commented code is inactive.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, high confidence (0.9). Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and none of the code snippets show malicious behavior such as code injection, network exfiltration, or data harvesting.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2), justified by the server setup and threading, but nothing suspicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear code, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Standard server setup with threading and dynamic port allocation; minimal risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical FastAPI server setup with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.",
