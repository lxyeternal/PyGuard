{
  "purpose": "This code defines a FastAPI application class that manages server startup, middleware, static file serving, and plugin registration, primarily for a web UI with file upload capabilities.",
  "sources": "Request data, environment variables, uploaded files via EasyFileUploader, configuration parameters such as port and host.",
  "sinks": "Responses to HTTP requests, logging outputs, static file serving, server control signals, and optional file uploads.",
  "flows": "HTTP request handling flows through middleware, exception handlers, and registered functions; server runs in a separate thread with dynamic port allocation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; commented-out code is inactive and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard FastAPI patterns for server setup, including middleware, exception handling, threading, and static file management. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. Use of threading and dynamic port selection are typical practices. No obfuscation or insecure code practices are present. The code's structure and logic are consistent with legitimate server applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured FastAPI server setup with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, justified by standard server management practices but no actual vulnerabilities.",
