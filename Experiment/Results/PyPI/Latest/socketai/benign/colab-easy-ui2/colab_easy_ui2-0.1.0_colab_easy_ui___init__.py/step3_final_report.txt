  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and malicious potential of the provided Python code snippet.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network communication functions, file I/O operations.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from sources to sinks via functions or variable assignments, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, minimal or empty scripts, lack of comments or structure, potential obfuscation indicators absent.",
  "analysis": "The code is either missing or minimal, with no identifiable source or sink functions. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code's benign nature is supported by the lack of malicious indicators or anomalous behavior. The low confidence score reflects the limited information, but the absence of suspicious activity justifies a low malware and security risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. Given the minimal content, the overall security risk is very low. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence.",
