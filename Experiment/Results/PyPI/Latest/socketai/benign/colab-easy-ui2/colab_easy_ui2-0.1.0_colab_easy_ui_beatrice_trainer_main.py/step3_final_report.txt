{
  "purpose": "Sets up a web server with file upload, unzip, and JSON save functionalities, serving static frontend files.",
  "sources": "File upload input ('upload/voice.zip'), external functions 'unzip' and 'json_save', environment variables (if any), and the current file path.",
  "sinks": "Endpoints '/functions_unzip' and '/functions_json_save' that process uploaded files and save JSON data.",
  "flows": "Upload file -> 'unzip' function processes 'voice.zip' -> 'json_save' function saves configuration JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; external functions assumed safe; server runs indefinitely without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward server setup for handling file uploads, unzipping, and saving JSON configurations. It uses standard libraries and external modules presumed safe. No malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The server exposes endpoints that process user-uploaded files, but no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. External functions 'unzip' and 'json_save' are assumed safe, and the server's purpose is typical for a web-based UI for file management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard web server setup for file upload and processing with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
