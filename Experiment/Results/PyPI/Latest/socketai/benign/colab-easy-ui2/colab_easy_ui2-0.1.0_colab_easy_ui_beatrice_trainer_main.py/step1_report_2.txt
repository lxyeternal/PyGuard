{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a web server interface using ColabEasyUI, enabling file uploads, unzipping, saving JSON configurations, and serving static files.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (if any), input files uploaded via the web interface (voice.zip), and configuration data from functions like json_save.",
  "sinks": "Functions that handle file extraction, JSON saving, server start/stop, and static file serving; these are generally safe but could be misused if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Uploads zip file → unzip function; Upload and save JSON → json_save function; Static files served from frontend/dist; User interacts via web interface.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; no suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors; no network calls outside standard server operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party modules used for web server management, file handling, and UI interaction. It defines functions to run and wrap a server, handling file uploads and static content. The functions use functools.partial for invoking unzip and json_save, passing parameters like port, file paths, etc. The server runs in an infinite loop, with a clean shutdown on KeyboardInterrupt. There are no apparent data leaks, external network calls, or malicious behaviors. All operations are related to file handling and serving content in a typical web app context. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical server setup script for a web UI with file upload and processing capabilities. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use within a controlled environment.",
