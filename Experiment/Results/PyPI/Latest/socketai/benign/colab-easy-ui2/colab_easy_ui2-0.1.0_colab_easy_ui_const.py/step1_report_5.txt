  "sources": "Reading the constant string 'colab_easy_ui2' and constructing a Path object with it.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only creates a Path object with a static filename.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static data is used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a logger name and constructs a Path object for a log file named after the logger. There are no input reads, no dynamic data from untrusted sources, and no suspicious code constructs. The code is straightforward and appears to be standard setup code for logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines static variables for logging purposes.",
