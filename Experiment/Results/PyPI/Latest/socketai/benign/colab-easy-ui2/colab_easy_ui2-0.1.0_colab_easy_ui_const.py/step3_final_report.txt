  "purpose": "Define a logger name and create a log file path based on that name.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines constants and creates a Path object.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or outputs; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path, defines a constant LOGGER_NAME, and creates a Path object LOG_FILE based on LOGGER_NAME. It does not process input, handle secrets, or perform any dynamic or external operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The code serves as a simple configuration snippet for logging setup, with no potential security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
