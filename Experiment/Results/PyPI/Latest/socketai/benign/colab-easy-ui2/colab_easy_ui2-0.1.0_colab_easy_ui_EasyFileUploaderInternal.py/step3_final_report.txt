  "purpose": "Provides API endpoints for uploading files, retrieving uploader info, and concatenating file chunks with filename sanitization and whitelist enforcement.",
  "sources": "Input data from uploaded files, filename form data, and chunk number form data.",
  "sinks": "File system writes for uploaded files and concatenated chunks; potential for filename manipulation if misconfigured.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from API endpoints through filename sanitization and whitelist checks into file write operations; chunk concatenation reads multiple chunk files and writes a combined file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.path.basename for sanitization, which is standard; relies on allowed_filenames whitelist; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward file upload and concatenation with basic filename sanitization via os.path.basename and optional whitelist restrictions. No network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. Exception handling is minimal but appropriate. The filename sanitization effectively prevents directory traversal, assuming correct whitelist configuration. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The security risk is low, primarily dependent on correct configuration of allowed_filenames. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is approximately 0.2, justified by the minimal inherent vulnerabilities. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of a file upload and concatenation API with basic filename sanitization and whitelist restrictions. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is detected. The low security risk score is justified, assuming proper configuration of allowed filenames.",
