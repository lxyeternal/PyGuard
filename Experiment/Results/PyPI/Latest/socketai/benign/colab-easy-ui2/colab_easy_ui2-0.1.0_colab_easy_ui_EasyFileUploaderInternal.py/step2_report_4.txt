  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for potential issues, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code performs standard file upload, filename sanitization, and chunk concatenation.\n- Filename sanitization relies on `os.path.basename()` to prevent directory traversal.\n- Allowed filenames are set via `set_allowed_filenames()`, functioning as a whitelist.\n- No evidence of code obfuscation, malicious network activity, or backdoors.\n- No system commands or code execution based on user input.\n- Exception handling is present but basic.\n- The logic appears straightforward and secure under correct configuration.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate; describes the upload and concatenation flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions possible misconfiguration of `allowed_filenames` but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, which seems reasonable.\n- **Justification for scores:** No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Risk is low, mainly configuration-related.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent analysis.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, straightforward file handling, filename sanitization is sufficient.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to previous, confirms safe handling.\n- **Scores:** Same as above, Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, standard logic.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4:**\n\n- Slightly more detailed, notes that filename sanitization is basic but acceptable.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n- **Analysis:** No malware, no obfuscation, proper handling.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5:**\n\n- Consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity, standard file handling.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 seems appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern, primarily related to configuration correctness and filename sanitization.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential concerns / recommendations:**\n\n- The filename sanitization relies solely on `os.path.basename()`, which prevents directory traversal but does not restrict dangerous filenames (e.g., filenames with special characters, very long names, or reserved names). However, given the context, this is acceptable.\n- The allowed filenames whitelist must be carefully configured to prevent misuse.\n- No validation on file content or size limits are present, but this is outside the scope of the current review.\n\n---\n\n### **Final conclusion:**\n\n- The code is well-structured, secure for its purpose, and free of malware or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to potential misconfiguration, but not inherently risky)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' evaluations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and does not exhibit malicious or obfuscated behaviors. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
