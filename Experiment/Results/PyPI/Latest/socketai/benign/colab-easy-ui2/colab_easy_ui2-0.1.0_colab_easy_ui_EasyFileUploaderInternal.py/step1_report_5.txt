{
  "purpose": "The code implements a file uploader API using FastAPI, allowing file uploads, file info retrieval, and concatenation of uploaded file chunks.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from uploaded files via FastAPI's UploadFile, and form data such as filename and index are received from POST requests.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations to disk (shutil.copyfileobj, open in write/append mode), and response generation via JSONResponse.",
  "flows": "Input from UploadFile and form data (filename, index, chunk number) flows into filename sanitization and file writing functions, which then write to disk; concatenated chunks are read and combined into a single file.",
  "anomalies": "Filename sanitization uses basename to prevent directory traversal; filenames are restricted to allowed filenames if specified; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious external calls are present; file operations appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code handles file uploads and concatenation securely with filename sanitization via os.path.basename, preventing directory traversal. Allowed filenames can restrict uploads. No evident malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Error handling is basic but appropriate. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected. All file operations are standard for upload and merge functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a file upload and concatenation API with proper filename sanitization and allowed filename restrictions. No signs of malicious or sabotage behavior were found. It performs typical file system operations without external network activity or hidden functions.",
