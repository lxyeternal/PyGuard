  "purpose": "Manage starting TensorBoard sessions and fetch data via localhost endpoints.",
  "sources": "Method arguments for directory paths, port selection via portpicker, internal URL construction, and requests to localhost endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Requests to localhost; no external data sinks or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Method inputs (e.g., project_dir, run, tag, blob_key) influence URL construction; requests fetch data from local TensorBoard server; system commands start TensorBoard processes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'system_raw' with constructed commands could pose risks if inputs are manipulated, but in controlled environments, this is standard. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages TensorBoard sessions via system commands and starts notebook servers, with URL endpoints constructed from method parameters. No external untrusted input is directly processed; commands are internally generated. Network requests are confined to localhost, reducing external attack surface. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The primary concern is the execution of system commands, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated, but in typical controlled environments, this is acceptable. The code appears to be a standard utility for local TensorBoard management, with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing TensorBoard sessions and data retrieval in local or Colab environments. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of system commands warrants cautious review but is standard in such contexts. Overall, the security posture is sound.",
