  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code manages starting TensorBoard sessions and fetching data via localhost. No external untrusted input is processed, and commands are controlled.\n- **Findings:** Uses system_raw for starting TensorBoard with arguments controlled within the code; no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads. Requests are to localhost, and URLs are constructed internally.\n- **Risk & Malware:** No signs of malware; low security risk (0.2). Confidence is high (0.9). Obfuscated code is 0.\n- **Verdict:** The logic is sound; no malicious activity detected. The process is standard for such utilities.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on managing TensorBoard and fetching data, with potential risks in executing system commands.\n- **Findings:** System calls via `system_raw` could be risky if `ipython` input is manipulated, but in typical use, it executes standard commands. URL construction is based on method parameters, which are internal or controlled.\n- **Risk & Malware:** No malware detected; low risk (0.3). Confidence is 0.8.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious intent; standard utility with typical risks associated with executing shell commands.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Manages starting TensorBoard and fetching data, with user inputs influencing URL construction.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets or backdoors; uses standard network requests. Potential concern if parameters are maliciously crafted, but primarily used internally.\n- **Risk & Malware:** No malware; risk is low (0.2). Confidence 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Functionality appears legitimate; no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with focus on starting TensorBoard and fetching data.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code or malicious network activity; standard local data fetching.\n- **Risk & Malware:** No malware; risk 0.2. Confidence 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious behavior detected; routine utility.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same general purpose; manages TensorBoard sessions and data retrieval.\n- **Findings:** No data leaks, backdoors, or obfuscated code; confined to localhost interactions.\n- **Risk & Malware:** No malware; risk 0.2. Confidence 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Safe, standard code.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code Logic:** All reports agree that the code is a utility for managing TensorBoard sessions and fetching data via localhost.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected in any report; all scores are 0.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low (around 0.2–0.3), mainly related to executing system commands with user-controlled parameters, but in controlled environments, this is typical.\n- **Environment & Inputs:** Inputs are either internal or controlled; no evidence of malicious input handling or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the potential risks associated with executing system commands and handling user parameters, but considering the controlled context and no malicious activity, a conservative but justified score would be around **0.2–0.3**.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The current scores seem appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- The main concern is the use of `system_raw` for starting TensorBoard, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. However, in standard use, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided scores and conclusions.** The code appears to be a legitimate utility with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, controlled utility for managing TensorBoard sessions and data retrieval, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
