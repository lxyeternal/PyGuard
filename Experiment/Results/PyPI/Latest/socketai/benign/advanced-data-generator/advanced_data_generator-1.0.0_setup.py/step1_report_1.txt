{
  "purpose": "This script sets up and configures a Python package called 'advanced-data-generator' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup and find_packages from setuptools; defining dependencies in install_requires; reading package metadata such as author and URL.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data processing, network communication, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the README.md file and static metadata into the setup() function, which prepares the package configuration. There are no untrusted input sources leading to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected; all code appears to be standard package setup procedures with no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary setup tools, reads a documentation file for description, and defines package configuration including dependencies, author info, and entry points. Dependencies are version-locked, and all values are static. No code execution, network calls, or dynamic behavior is present. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed. The code follows typical Python package setup conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign package configuration file.",
