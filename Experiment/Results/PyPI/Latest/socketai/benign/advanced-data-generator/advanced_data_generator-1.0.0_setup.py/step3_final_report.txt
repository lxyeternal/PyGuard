  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description; static dependency declarations; package metadata and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network calls, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with fixed dependencies and standard structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file, specifies dependencies with fixed versions, and defines package metadata, author info, URL, classifiers, and CLI entry points. No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The dependencies are common and fixed, reducing supply chain risks. The entry point 'main:main' is standard for CLI tools. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. All critical reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the static, straightforward nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate and consistent in their assessments. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
