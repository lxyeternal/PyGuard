{
  "purpose": "This code is for configuring and setting up a Python package named 'advanced-data-generator'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports from setuptools for package setup; reads package dependencies and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; standard setup process without data handling or external input execution.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> Loads dependencies -> Sets up package metadata -> Defines entry points for CLI execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. The dependencies listed are standard and version-specific, with no unusual or malicious references.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical package setup using setuptools, reading a README file for description and defining dependencies, author info, and CLI entry points. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The dependencies are common Python libraries used in data processing and web apps, with explicit versions specified. The setup script does not include any network calls, data leaks, or other security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script appears to be a standard, benign package configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
