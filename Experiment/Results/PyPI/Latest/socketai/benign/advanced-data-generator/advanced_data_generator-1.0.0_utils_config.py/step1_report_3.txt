{
  "purpose": "This code manages application configuration by loading data from a YAML file and providing accessors for various configuration parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'config.yaml' file when load_config() is called",
  "sinks": "Potentially any configuration value fetched can influence application behavior but there are no direct untrusted data sinks like network or system commands",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the YAML file (load_config), stored in class variable, and accessed via get methods; no untrusted data flows to external systems",
  "anomalies": "Uses yaml.safe_load which mitigates YAML injection risks; no hardcoded secrets; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern for configuration management, loading YAML configuration safely with error handling. It constructs file paths relative to the caller script location and ensures directories exist before use. No use of untrusted input in sensitive operations; no network calls, system modifications, or obfuscated logic present. Proper exception handling for file errors. Overall, the code appears standard and secure with respect to supply chain and runtime security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration handler with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It safely loads and accesses configuration data, and the usage patterns do not pose security risks.",
