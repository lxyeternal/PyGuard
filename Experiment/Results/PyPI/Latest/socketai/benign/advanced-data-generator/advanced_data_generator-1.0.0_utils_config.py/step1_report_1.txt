{
  "purpose": "This code defines a singleton configuration management class that loads settings from a YAML file and provides access methods for various configuration parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration file 'config.yaml' in load_config method, and reading environment-relative paths in get_database_path and get_export_directory methods.",
  "sinks": "os.makedirs in get_export_directory potentially creates directories; file reading in load_config; returning configuration data.",
  "flows": "File read in load_config -> stored in _config -> accessed via get methods -> path computations in get_database_path and get_export_directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution; no suspicious network activity; straightforward configuration handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern for configuration management, loading data from a YAML file, with safe YAML parsing via yaml.safe_load. Path resolution methods construct file paths relative to the script location, and directories are created as needed. No external network calls, no use of untrusted inputs beyond reading a local YAML file, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration loader with safe practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The only consideration is ensuring the configuration file is secure and properly validated, which is outside the scope of this code. Overall, the code is benign.",
