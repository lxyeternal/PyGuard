  "purpose": "Configuration management class that loads settings from a YAML file, resolving paths and creating directories as needed.",
  "sources": "Reads 'config.yaml' file, accesses configuration keys via get methods, and uses __file__ for path resolution.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or external effects; primarily filesystem operations and configuration access.",
  "flows": "Loads YAML data from file -> accesses configuration keys -> resolves paths -> creates directories if needed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no obfuscation, standard use of yaml.safe_load.",
  "analysis": "The code is a singleton configuration loader that safely reads from a YAML file, resolves relative paths, and creates directories. It uses safe YAML parsing, handles errors appropriately, and does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions. No external network activity, no code injection, and no obfuscation are present. The directory creation is standard and based on configuration values, with no signs of malicious intent. The code structure and logic are straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration management class with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The security risk and malware scores are correctly set to 0, and the overall assessment indicates minimal security concern.",
