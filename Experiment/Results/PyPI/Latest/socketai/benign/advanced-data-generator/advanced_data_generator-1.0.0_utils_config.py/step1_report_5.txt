  "purpose": "This code provides a singleton configuration management class that loads and accesses settings from a YAML configuration file.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'config.yaml' file when load_config() is called.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but the configuration values are used to construct file paths and directories, which could influence file system operations.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from the YAML file into internal class variables and is used for path constructions and configuration retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior. Usage of 'yaml.safe_load' minimizes risk of code execution from YAML content. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No malicious network or system actions are performed.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a singleton pattern for configuration management, loading data from a YAML file. The loading process handles errors explicitly, raising exceptions if the file is missing or invalid. The code constructs file paths based on relative directories, which is standard. Directory creation is performed safely with 'os.makedirs' and 'exist_ok=True'. No user input is directly handled, and there are no network operations, command executions, or suspicious data handling. The code does not include any obfuscated or dynamic execution features, nor does it contain malicious backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured configuration handler with no malicious intent or security risks. It reads configuration data securely and uses it for file path operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
