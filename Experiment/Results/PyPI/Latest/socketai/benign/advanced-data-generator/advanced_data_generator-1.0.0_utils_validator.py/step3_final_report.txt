{
  "purpose": "The code provides validation functions for user email, phone, age, product, and order data, relying on configuration parameters for validation rules.",
  "sources": "Input data from user_data, product_data, order_data dictionaries; configuration data from Config class (email domains, phone formats, age limits).",
  "sinks": "Validation functions process data internally; no external system calls, network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into validation methods; results are returned as validation status and errors; no external sinks or data exfiltration points identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation tasks using regex and configuration data. It does not include dynamic code execution, network operations, or obfuscated code. The logic is standard, with no signs of malicious intent. The configuration reliance is typical for validation modules. No logical flaws or security issues are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard validation utility with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low security risk score is justified. The supply chain security assessment indicates no threat; the code can be considered benign.",
