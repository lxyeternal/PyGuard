{
  "purpose": "This code provides validation functions for user data, product data, and order data, likely for an e-commerce or user management system.",
  "sources": "Input data from user_data, product_data, order_data dictionaries, and configuration data from Config class (via self.config.get_validation_config()).",
  "sinks": "Validation functions process data but do not execute system commands, write to files, or send data over the network. No direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into validation functions; validation results are returned as validation status and errors. No external system calls or dangerous operations are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward validation module verifying email formats, phone formats, age ranges, and data consistency for various entities. It uses regex for pattern matching, and data validation is based on configuration parameters. No input handling involves external system commands, file access, or network operations. The configuration is retrieved via a Config class, but this does not appear malicious or suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code structure is clean, and logic is simple and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation utility with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It securely validates input data based on provided configurations without unsafe practices or external interactions. No malicious behaviors or security risks are detected.",
