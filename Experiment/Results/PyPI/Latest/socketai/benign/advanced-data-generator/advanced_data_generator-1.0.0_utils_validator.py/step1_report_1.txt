  "purpose": "The code provides validation methods for user, product, and order data within a larger application, ensuring data integrity and correctness.",
  "sources": "Input data from user_data, product_data, order_data dictionaries, and environment variables via Config object.",
  "sinks": "Return validation results and errors; no direct data leakage or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation functions, with checks against regex patterns and config values, returning validation status.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation tasks with standard regex and data checks. It uses configuration for email domains and phone formats, avoiding hardcoded secrets. No external system calls, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Validation functions process input data and return validation status and errors. All code appears to serve its intended purpose safely. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation module with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It adheres to best practices for data validation and does not include any malicious or harmful code segments.",
