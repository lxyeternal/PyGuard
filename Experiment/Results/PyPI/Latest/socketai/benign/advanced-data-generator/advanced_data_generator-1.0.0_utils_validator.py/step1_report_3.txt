{
  "purpose": "The code provides validation functions for user, product, and order data within a larger application, ensuring data conforms to specified formats and constraints.",
  "sources": "Configuration data accessed via self.config.get_validation_config(), data passed into validate_user, validate_product, and validate_order methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write to or read from external or sensitive sources such as network, files, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method input parameters through validation functions and into returned dictionaries indicating validity and errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Validation patterns are straightforward. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard regex for email and phone validation, date calculations for age, and basic type and value checks for product and order data. It accesses configuration data to validate domains and phone formats. No external system calls, network access, or dynamic code execution are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard validation class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on configuration for domain and phone validation and performs routine data checks. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. Overall, the code is safe.",
