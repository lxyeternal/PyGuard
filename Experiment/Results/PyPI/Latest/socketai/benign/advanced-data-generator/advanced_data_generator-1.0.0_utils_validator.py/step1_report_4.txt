{
  "purpose": "The code provides validation methods for user, product, and order data in an application, including email, phone, age, and other data validations.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters such as email, phone, birth_date, user_data, product_data, and order_data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; the code performs validation only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through validation functions, with no external or untrusted data influencing critical operations or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present. The code depends on configuration data, but this is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation checks on input data fields for correctness and adherence to expected formats and ranges. It uses regex for email and phone validation and basic conditional logic for other fields. No external data or commands are executed, and no obfuscated or malicious code is present. The code appears to be standard validation logic without malicious intent or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical validation module with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It uses standard validation techniques and relies on configuration data for validation parameters. No anomalies, malware, or security risks are detected.",
