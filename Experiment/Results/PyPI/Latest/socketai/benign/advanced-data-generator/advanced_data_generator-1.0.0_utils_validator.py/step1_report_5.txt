{
  "purpose": "The code provides validation functions for user, product, and order data within an application, ensuring data integrity and correctness.",
  "sources": "Inputs such as email, phone, birth_date, user_data, product_data, and order_data fields",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; validation results are returned internally, with no evident data leaks or external data transmission",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation functions where format and content are checked; no untrusted data is forwarded to external systems or used insecurely",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Regex patterns are straightforward; no dynamic execution or obfuscation present. The code relies on configuration for validation parameters, which appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data validation procedures, including regex matching for email and phone formats, date-based age validation, and basic checks for product and order details. No unusual or malicious behaviors such as network activity, file access, or data exfiltration are evident. The code uses configuration for validation rules, which is typical and does not introduce security risks. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign validation utility with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It does not contain suspicious or malicious behavior based on the provided analysis.",
