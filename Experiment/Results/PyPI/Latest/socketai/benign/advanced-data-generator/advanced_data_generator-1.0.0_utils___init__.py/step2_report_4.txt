  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code carefully.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .config import Config\nfrom .validator import Validator\n\n__all__ = ['Config', 'Validator']\n```\n\n**Key observations:**\n- The code only performs static import statements from local modules `.config` and `.validator`.\n- It defines `__all__` to specify the public API.\n- No dynamic code execution, no data processing, no external network communication.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the code as a straightforward module export setup.\n- No data flows, sinks, or anomalies are detected.\n- All confidently state the code is benign, standard, and without malicious intent.\n- The analyses are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code is benign and only involves import/export statements.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the code as standard and non-malicious.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk):**  \n  All reports assign 0 to malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None are assigned, which is correct.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior; the malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's static analysis.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  All scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the analysis, my own estimates are:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n  No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n  The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk score:** **0**  \n  No security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a simple module export file with no security concerns. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nAccept the current assessments; the code is safe and benign.",
