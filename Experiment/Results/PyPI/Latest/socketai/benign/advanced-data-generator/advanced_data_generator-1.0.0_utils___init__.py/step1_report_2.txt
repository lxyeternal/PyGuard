  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external or untrusted data; the code only imports and exports class names.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports classes from local modules and defines the module's public API via '__all__'. There are no dynamic executions, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. It functions as a typical module export statement without any malicious intent or risky behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a straightforward module interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
