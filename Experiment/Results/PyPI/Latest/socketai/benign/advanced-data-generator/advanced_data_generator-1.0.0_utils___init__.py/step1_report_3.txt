  "purpose": "The code exports two modules, Config and Validator, for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .config and .validator",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code only handles module imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two classes or objects from local modules and defines the __all__ list for module exports. There are no input reading, no data processing, no external network operations, nor any dynamic or obfuscated code. The structure is minimal and standard for Python package __init__.py files.",
  "conclusion": "There is no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks present in this code. It functions as a straightforward module export definition.",
