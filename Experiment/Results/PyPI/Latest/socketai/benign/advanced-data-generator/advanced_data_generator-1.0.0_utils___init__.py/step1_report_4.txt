  "purpose": "Defines module exports for Config and Validator classes.",
  "sources": "Imports Config and Validator from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code is only exporting symbols.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initialization script that imports two classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__. It does not perform any data processing, input reading, or external communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hardcoded credentials, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The code structure is typical for Python modules, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard module export code with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports two classes for external use.",
