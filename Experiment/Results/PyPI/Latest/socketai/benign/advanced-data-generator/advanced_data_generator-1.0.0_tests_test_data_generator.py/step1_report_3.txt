  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the DataGenerator class and related database models to verify data generation and export functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the generator methods, database session, and files during export.",
  "sinks": "File writing during data export; database commit operations.",
  "flows": "Generator methods produce data that is stored in database or written to files; test assertions verify data integrity and existence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of standard libraries and testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard testing code for data generation and export functionality. It uses pytest fixtures, model instantiation, database session commits, and file I/O. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No obfuscated code or unusual runtime behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be normal testing code for verifying data generation and export functions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident. It is a standard, safe testing suite.",
