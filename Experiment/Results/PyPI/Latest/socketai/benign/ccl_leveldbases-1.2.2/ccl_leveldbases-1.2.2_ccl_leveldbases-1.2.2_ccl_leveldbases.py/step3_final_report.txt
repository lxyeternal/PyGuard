{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes for decompressing, parsing, and analyzing LevelDB, log, and manifest files, primarily for recovery or inspection purposes.",
  "sources": "File streams reading binary data from disk, including decompression and binary parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "In-memory data structures such as bytes buffers and record objects; no external output or network activity.",
  "flows": "File streams → decompression and parsing functions → in-memory data structures and records.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Debug logs are optional and controlled by a flag.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard binary file parsing, decompression using Snappy, and data validation. It includes error handling for malformed files and uses well-structured classes for representing database components. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The debug logging is minimal and controlled. The overall design aligns with legitimate database recovery tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured parser for LevelDB and related files, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the potential handling of malformed files but no active threats.",
