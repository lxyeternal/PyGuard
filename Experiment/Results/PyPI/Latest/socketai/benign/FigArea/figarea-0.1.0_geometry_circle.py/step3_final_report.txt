  "purpose": "A simple Python class for representing a circle, validating radius, and calculating area.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'radius' during class instantiation",
  "sinks": "None; no external data output or network activity",
  "flows": "Input 'radius' → validation → area calculation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with standard validation",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard math library and a local geometry module, defines a class with proper validation of radius, and computes area using a standard formula. No external data, network calls, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and serves a legitimate purpose. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a geometric shape class with proper validation and calculation. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
