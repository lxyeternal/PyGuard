  "purpose": "Define a Circle class that calculates the area of a circle based on its radius.",
  "sources": "Input data is the radius parameter passed during object instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a ValueError if the radius is invalid; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Radius input -> _validate() -> potentially raises an exception; area() computes based on radius.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code is straightforward, using standard math operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pi from math and a Figure class from a local geometry module, then defines a Circle class with validation and an area calculation. The validation enforces positive radius. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of geometric calculation with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a Circle class for calculating the area. It does not contain malware or security risks. It appears safe and intentionally designed for geometric computations.",
