{
  "purpose": "Define a Rectangle class that inherits from Figure, with methods to initialize dimensions, validate input, and calculate area.",
  "sources": "Input parameters a and b in the constructor, class import from geometry module",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no output or data leakage points",
  "flows": "Initialization flows from constructor parameters to class attributes; validation method checks attribute values",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures; simple class definition",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class Rectangle inheriting from Figure, with basic validation and area calculation. No suspicious imports, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or data exfiltration. The _validate() method raises errors on invalid inputs but is not called within the provided code, which is typical for such a class. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. Overall, the code appears straightforward and intended for geometric calculations without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard geometric class definition with input validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems safe and typical for a geometry library component.",
