  "purpose": "Define a Rectangle class inheriting from Figure with validation and area calculation methods.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the same package; class constructor; validation method; area method.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Constructor assigns 'a' and 'b'; '_validate' checks side lengths; 'area' computes and returns the product.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition for geometric calculations. It imports a base class, initializes with side lengths, includes validation for positive values, and calculates the area. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no external data flows, or suspicious patterns. The structure and functions are typical for such a class. No anomalies or hidden malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of a geometric shape class without any malicious intent or security risks.",
