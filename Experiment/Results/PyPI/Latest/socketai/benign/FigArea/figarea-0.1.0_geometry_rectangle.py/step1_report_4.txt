{
  "purpose": "Define a Rectangle class that inherits from a base Figure class, providing methods for validation and area calculation.",
  "sources": "The class receives input through the constructor parameters 'a' and 'b', which are used as side lengths.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs or external connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow into the class instance, used internally for validation and calculation; no external data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. The code performs standard object-oriented definitions without unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Rectangle' with attributes 'a' and 'b'. The '_validate' method checks if these sides are positive; the 'area' method computes the rectangle's area. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no external data or network operations, and no suspicious or obfuscated code present. The import statement suggests dependency on an external 'Figure' class, but this in itself is not suspicious. The code appears to be a standard geometric class implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a rectangle shape with validation and area calculation. No malicious behavior, malware, or security issues are evident.",
