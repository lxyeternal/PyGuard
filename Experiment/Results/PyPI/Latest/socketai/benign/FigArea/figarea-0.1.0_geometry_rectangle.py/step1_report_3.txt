  "purpose": "Define a Rectangle class that inherits from a Figure base class, allowing calculation of the rectangle's area.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' in the constructor; class attribute assignments; validation method.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data being written to external systems or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> class attributes -> validation -> area calculation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward class for a geometric figure with validation to ensure positive side lengths and an area calculation method. There are no external data sources, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, or other suspicious features. It imports a Figure class, which is not provided but presumed to be a simple base class. The implementation appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal implementation of a geometric class with validation and calculation methods. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
