  "purpose": "Define a Triangle class for geometric calculations, including validation and area computation.",
  "sources": "Input sides a, b, c provided during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code raises exceptions on invalid input but does not write or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input sides are validated and used for calculations; no data flows to external systems or networks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of standard math library and straightforward calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Triangle class that inherits from a Figure class. It validates that the sides are positive and form a valid triangle. It calculates the area using Heron's formula and checks if the triangle is right-angled by comparing the squares of the sorted sides. No external data or network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard geometric utility implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
