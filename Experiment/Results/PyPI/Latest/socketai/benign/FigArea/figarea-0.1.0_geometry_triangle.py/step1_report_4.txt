  "purpose": "Define a Triangle class for geometric calculations, including validation, area calculation, and right-angle check.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: a, b, c (triangle sides). No external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs beyond internal calculations; no untrusted data handling or external connections.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → validation and calculations (area, is_right_angled property). No external data flow or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code performs standard geometric computations with validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sqrt' from 'math' and a local module 'geometry'. Defines a Triangle class inheriting from Figure, with side validation, area calculation using Heron's formula, and a property to check if it is right-angled. All functions are standard geometric operations with proper validation. No user input, no external data handling, no code execution based on untrusted sources, and no suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard geometric class implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs basic validation and calculations safely. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
