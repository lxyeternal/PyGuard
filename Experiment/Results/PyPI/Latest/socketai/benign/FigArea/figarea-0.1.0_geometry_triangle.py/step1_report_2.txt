{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Triangle class that inherits from a Figure class, used to model triangle geometries with validation and property methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the constructor parameters a, b, c which represent side lengths.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network operations, file I/O, or external data outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The input side lengths are validated in _validate(), then used in area() for calculations, and is_right_angled property for geometric checks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious functions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geometric calculations and validations for a triangle. It includes input validation for positive sides and triangle inequality, computes the area using Heron's formula, and checks for right-angled triangles. All functions are straightforward, with no external or malicious interactions. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard geometric utility class without any malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs geometric calculations and input validation. No indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious code present.",
