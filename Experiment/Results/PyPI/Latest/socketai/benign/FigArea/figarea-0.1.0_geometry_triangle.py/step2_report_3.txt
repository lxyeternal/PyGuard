  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n1. **Code Verification:**\n   - The code defines a `Triangle` class with validation, area calculation, and right-angle check.\n   - The validation correctly enforces positive side lengths and the triangle inequality.\n   - The area calculation uses Heron's formula.\n   - The right-angled check sorts sides and compares squares, rounding to mitigate floating-point issues.\n   - No external data handling, network, or file I/O is present.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are evident.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are detected.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Evaluation:**\n   - The code is straightforward and performs standard geometric operations.\n   - The validation is appropriate and robust for the context.\n   - The calculations are mathematically sound.\n   - The code does not process untrusted external data beyond constructor parameters.\n   - No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores Review:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the clear, straightforward implementation.\n   - **Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which seems reasonable given the context.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which is appropriate.\n   - No report suggests any suspicious or malicious behavior that warrants raising the malware or risk scores.\n\n5. **Justification for Scores:**\n   - Since the code is a simple, standard geometric utility with proper validation and no external dependencies or data flows, the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n   - The risk score could be marginally increased if considering supply chain security, but given the code's benign nature, keeping it at 0 or 0.1 is reasonable.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is safe, well-structured, and performs as expected.\n   - No changes to the scores are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, just a standard utility class with minimal risk)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No further suspicion or concern is warranted.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, secure implementation of a triangle geometry class with appropriate validation and calculations. The assigned scores are reasonable and should remain as is.",
