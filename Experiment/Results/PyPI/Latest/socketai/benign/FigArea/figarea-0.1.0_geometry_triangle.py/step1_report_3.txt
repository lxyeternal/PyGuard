{
  "purpose": "Defines a Triangle class for geometric calculations, including validation and area computation.",
  "sources": "Input data: constructor parameters for side lengths (a, b, c).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data being sent to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → validation and property methods; no external data flow or untrusted data handling beyond initial input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward implementation of geometric logic without obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Triangle class with validation to ensure positive side lengths and triangle inequality. It computes the area using Heron's formula and checks if the triangle is right-angled. No external input/output, no use of insecure functions, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard geometric utility class with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs basic calculations securely and efficiently.",
