  "purpose": "Defines a Triangle class for geometric calculations, including validation, area computation, and right-angled check.",
  "sources": "Input parameters a, b, c for triangle sides, used within class methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling beyond input parameters, no network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through validation, area calculation, and right-angled check methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. The code performs standard geometric calculations without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Triangle class inheriting from a Figure base, with side validation to ensure positive lengths and triangle inequality. It computes the area using Heron's formula and checks if the triangle is right-angled by Pythagoras theorem. No external inputs are processed beyond constructor parameters. No network, file, or environment variable usage. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a straightforward geometric utility implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for triangle geometry with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic validation and calculations safely.",
