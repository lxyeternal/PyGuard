  "purpose": "Provides geometric calculations and validation for a triangle based on side lengths.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (a, b, c) for side lengths.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data beyond input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation -> area calculation and right-angle check.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Triangle class with proper validation of side lengths, ensuring positive values and triangle inequality. It calculates the area using Heron's formula and checks if the triangle is right-angled by comparing squares of sorted sides, rounded to mitigate floating-point issues. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is clear, with no suspicious or malicious constructs. The validation and calculations are standard geometric operations, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0-0.1) are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of a Triangle utility class with proper validation and calculations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
