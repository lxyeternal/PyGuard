  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class 'Figure' with methods for calculating area and input validation",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading present in the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks, no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling present",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be a straightforward abstract class definition with no unusual patterns or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with two abstract methods: 'area' and '_validate'. It uses standard Python features such as ABC and abstractmethod decorators. No input/output operations, network connections, or dynamic code execution are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are identified. The class appears to be a typical design pattern for shape objects requiring area calculation and validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard abstract class definition used for shape objects, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a clean, non-suspicious code fragment.",
