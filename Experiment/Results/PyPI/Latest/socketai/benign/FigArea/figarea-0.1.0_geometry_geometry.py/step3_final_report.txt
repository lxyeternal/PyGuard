  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class 'Figure' with methods for calculating area and input validation, serving as an interface for geometric shape subclasses.",
  "sources": "No data sources; class methods are abstract and do not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; abstract methods do not process data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple, standard abstract class using Python's abc module, with two abstract methods: 'area()' and '_validate()'. It contains no external dependencies, input/output, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the benign, standard nature of this code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent. The confidence level of 1 is justified given the clarity and straightforwardness of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard abstract class serving as an interface for geometric figures. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
