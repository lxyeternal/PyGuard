  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for geometric figures with methods for calculating area and input validation.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines abstract methods without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward class definition with no unusual code, hidden behavior, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "This code imports the 'ABC' and 'abstractmethod' to create an abstract base class 'Figure'. It declares two abstract methods: 'area' and '_validate', intended for subclasses to implement. There are no dynamic code executions, input/output operations, or security-sensitive actions. The code is minimal and conventional, focusing on defining an interface for shapes. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign abstract class definition with no malicious behavior or security issues. It simply establishes a contract for subclasses representing geometric figures.",
