  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for geometric figures with methods for calculating area and input validation.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; class definition and method signatures only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; purely abstract method declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution paths; the code is a simple class definition with abstract methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The class contains only abstract method declarations without implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports ABC and abstractmethod from the abc module to define an abstract class 'Figure'. It declares two abstract methods: 'area' and '_validate'. The class is intended as a base class for geometric figures, requiring subclasses to implement these methods. There are no data inputs, no data processing, and no side effects. The code does not include any malicious constructs, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a straightforward, well-formed abstract class definition with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign abstract class definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard pattern in object-oriented programming to define an interface for geometric figures. No anomalies, malware, or security issues are present.",
