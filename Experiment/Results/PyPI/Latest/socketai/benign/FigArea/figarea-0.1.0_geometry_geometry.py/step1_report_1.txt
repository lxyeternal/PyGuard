  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for geometric figures with methods for calculating area and validating input.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines a class and methods without reading external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard Python constructs for abstract classes and methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'Figure' with two abstract methods: 'area' and '_validate'. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external dependencies. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The structure is typical for an abstract base class intended for inheritance.\n\nGiven the simplicity and standard pattern, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risk. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a standard implementation of an abstract base class in Python with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It serves as a template for other classes to implement shape-specific logic.",
