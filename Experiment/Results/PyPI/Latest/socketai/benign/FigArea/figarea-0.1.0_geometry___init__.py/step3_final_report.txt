  "purpose": "Import statements for local modules representing geometric shapes (Circle, Triangle, Rectangle).",
  "sources": "Local module files: .circle, .triangle, .rectangle.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; only static import statements, no data flow or execution path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements importing classes from local modules. No dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or data processing is present. The code is typical for a modular Python package defining geometric shapes. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected. The assumption that imported modules are safe is reasonable, but in a real supply chain context, module integrity should be verified separately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements for local modules. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The provided reports are accurate and the scores appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
