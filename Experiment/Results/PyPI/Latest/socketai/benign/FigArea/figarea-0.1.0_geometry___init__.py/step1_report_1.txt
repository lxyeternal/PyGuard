{
  "purpose": "The code imports three modules: Circle, Triangle, and Rectangle, likely for geometric shape operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .circle, .triangle, .rectangle",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or untrusted data processing observed",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing specific classes from local modules. There is no user input, no external network activity, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious behavior. These are standard Python import statements that are part of a larger project. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a geometric shapes package, with no signs of supply chain attacks or malicious code.",
