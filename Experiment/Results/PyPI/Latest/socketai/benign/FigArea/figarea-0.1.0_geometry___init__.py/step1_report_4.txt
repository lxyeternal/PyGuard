{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a module that imports classes for geometric shapes (Circle, Triangle, Rectangle). Its primary purpose is likely to facilitate shape-related functionalities within a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local module files: circle, triangle, and rectangle, to import respective classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into vulnerable functions or data leaks occur.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident since the code only imports classes; there are no functions or data processing flows shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements; no suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements for three classes. It is straightforward and lacks any dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity. The minimal structure indicates typical modular design without malicious intent. No anomalies or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple module import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and conventional.",
