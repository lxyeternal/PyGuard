{
  "purpose": "This code imports classes related to geometric shapes (Circle, Triangle, Rectangle) from local modules within a package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .circle, .triangle, .rectangle",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; simple import statements without runtime data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for classes from sibling modules within the same package. There is no code execution, data processing, user input handling, or external communication. The structure is typical for organizing code into modules. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import structure with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It is a standard practice for modular code organization.",
