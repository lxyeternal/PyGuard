{
  "purpose": "This code imports three classes: Circle, Triangle, and Rectangle from local modules, likely for geometric calculations or drawing purposes.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as there are no data inputs or processing beyond imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements with relative module references; there are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple imports from local modules, which is typical in modular Python projects. No external data sources, no dynamic execution, no security-sensitive operations are present. The absence of code execution, data handling, or external communications indicates low likelihood of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as an import statement for geometric classes. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
