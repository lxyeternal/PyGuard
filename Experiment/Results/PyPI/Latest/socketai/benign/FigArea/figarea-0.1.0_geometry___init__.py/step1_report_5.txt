{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python module that imports geometric shape classes from local submodules.",
  "sources": "Imports from local files: .circle, .triangle, .rectangle",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; just static imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes from local modules. No user input, network operations, file operations, or code execution are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for organizing code into modules. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, and no sensitive data handling is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple set of import statements for shape classes and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
