  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code is straightforward, with no external data or suspicious patterns.\n- Correctly notes the absence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Score justification:** The malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis. The overall security risk is negligible.\n- **Verdict:** The report's assessment appears accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the simplicity and safety of the code.\n- Correctly states no untrusted input or external data handling.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0; security risk is negligible.\n- **Verdict:** The report's evaluation seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the standard nature of the code, with no suspicious behavior.\n- No anomalies or malicious patterns identified.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0; security risk is negligible.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, confirms the code's straightforward and safe structure.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0; security risk is negligible.\n- **Verdict:** The evaluation aligns with the code's content.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, emphasizing the standard, safe implementation.\n- No anomalies or malicious intent detected.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0; security risk is negligible.\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description; no issues or anomalies are present.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; all reports agree on clarity.\n- **Security risk:** No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to the presence of exception handling code, but overall very low)\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The code is a standard, well-structured exception handling module.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
