  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and associated error codes for application error handling.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions for exception types and error codes, and the ApplicationException class constructor.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(self._message) which initializes the base Exception with a message.",
  "flows": "Exception type input -> error_code assignment -> super().__init__(message) call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, defining enums, constants, and a custom exception class without any dynamic code or external input processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration for exception types and maps these to HTTP status codes. The ApplicationException class uses these to encapsulate error details. There are no sources of untrusted input or sinks that process external data in a risky manner. The code simply assigns and retrieves values; no code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions with clear, safe mappings. It does not contain malware or suspicious activity. Overall security risk is negligible.",
