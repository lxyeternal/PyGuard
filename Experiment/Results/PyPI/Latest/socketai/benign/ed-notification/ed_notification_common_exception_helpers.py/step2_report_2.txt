  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review and Issue Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines an enum `Exceptions` with string values representing various exception types.\n   - It maps these exception types to HTTP status codes in `ERROR_CODES`.\n   - It defines a custom exception class `ApplicationException` that encapsulates an exception type, message, errors, and automatically assigns an error code based on the exception type.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no external input handling, no network operations, and no data leaks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious activity.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a typical implementation for structured error handling.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and `securityRisk=0`, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, which is reasonable given the clear, straightforward code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is justified because the code does not process untrusted input, does not perform network operations, and contains no suspicious patterns.\n   - No reason to elevate the risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior such as executing arbitrary code, exfiltrating data, or containing backdoors.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured exception handling module.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Personal Estimate (Final):**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and standard in nature.",
