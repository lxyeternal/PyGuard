  "purpose": "Defines custom exceptions and error codes for application error handling.",
  "sources": "Importing 'StrEnum' from 'enum'; class definitions; ERROR_CODES dictionary; ApplicationException constructor and properties.",
  "sinks": "None in the provided code; no data sinks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of ApplicationException with exception_type, message, errors; accessing properties such as message, errors, error_code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up exception classes and a custom exception handler that associates error codes with exception types. There is no user input, data parsing, or network interaction. All data flows are internal and controlled, with no evident manipulation of untrusted input. The structure is straightforward and conventional for error handling in Python. No signs of malicious intent, such as data leakage, backdoors, or malicious code behavior, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, secure setup for exception handling with clear mappings between exception types and HTTP status codes. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.",
