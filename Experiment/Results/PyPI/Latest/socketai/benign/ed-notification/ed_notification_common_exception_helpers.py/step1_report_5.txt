  "purpose": "Define custom application exceptions with associated HTTP error codes for use in an application.",
  "sources": "Constants and class definitions that assign error codes based on exception types.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(self._message) which passes the message to the base Exception class.",
  "flows": "Exception instance creation -> super().__init__(message) -> exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; standard exception and enum usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration for exception types and associates each with an HTTP status code in a dictionary. The ApplicationException class encapsulates exception details, including message, errors, and error code, initializing the base Exception class with the message. No user input handling, network operations, or data leaks are present. The structure is straightforward and follows common Python patterns. No anomalies or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides a standard implementation for custom exceptions with associated error codes. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a typical, safe exception handling structure for a Python application.",
