  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The report correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward implementation of exception enums, mappings, and a custom exception class.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound, and the code is standard.  \n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and safety.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores?** Appropriate at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The analysis correctly states that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores?** Properly set at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The report correctly describes the code as a typical exception setup.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores?** Appropriate at 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The reasoning is consistent with the code's straightforward design.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores?** Correctly assigned as 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**  \n- **Code correctness:** All reports accurately describe the code as a benign, standard exception handling module.  \n- **Malware risk:** None detected across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.  \n- **Security risk:** None, as no external input, dynamic code, or network operations are involved.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \nGiven the code's simplicity and the comprehensive, consistent reviews, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated code score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a clean, well-structured error handling setup with no security concerns.",
