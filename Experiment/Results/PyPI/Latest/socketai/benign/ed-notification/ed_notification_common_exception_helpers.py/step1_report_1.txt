{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and error codes for handling API errors and exceptions in an application.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, dictionary mappings, and class properties; no external data sources or input handling present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "The code maps exception types to error codes and uses class properties and __str__ method for message handling, with no external data flow or input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The exception handling and enum usage are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration for exception types, associates each with an HTTP status code via a dictionary, and creates a custom Exception class that uses these mappings. No user input, external data, or network operations are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation for structured error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured error handling module for application exceptions. It does not contain malware, suspicious activity, or security vulnerabilities. No malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
