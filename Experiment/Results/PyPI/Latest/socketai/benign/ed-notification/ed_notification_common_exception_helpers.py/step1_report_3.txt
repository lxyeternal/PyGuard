  "purpose": "Define exception types and error codes for application error handling",
  "sources": "Enum class Exceptions, ERROR_CODES dictionary, ApplicationException class constructor",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(self._message) where exception message is passed to base Exception",
  "flows": "Exception type and message passed to ApplicationException, which then initializes error code and message",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no external data handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of string-based exception types using StrEnum, assigns corresponding HTTP error codes in a dictionary, and creates a custom Exception class that encapsulates an exception type, message, and error list. The constructor maps the exception type to an error code and passes the message to the base Exception class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or data leaks. The code is structured properly for exception handling and seems standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured, non-malicious implementation of custom exceptions and error codes for application error handling. There are no indicators of malicious or suspicious activity.",
