  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, defining enums, a dictionary, and a custom exception class.\n- No external data, input handling, or network operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The purpose is to provide structured error handling in an application context.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n### Report 1\n- **Findings:** Correctly states that the code is benign, standard, and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. They seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard, safe code.\n- **Scores:** All zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Findings:** Same, straightforward, safe code.\n- **Scores:** Zero for malware, obfuscated, risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Findings:** Same consistent assessment.\n- **Scores:** Zero across the board.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity or code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security vulnerabilities or risky behavior)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a typical pattern for error handling, with no suspicious logic.\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The reasoning across reports is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, well-structured, and secure. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the true nature of the code.",
