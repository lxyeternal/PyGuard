{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of string-based exception types, maps them to HTTP status codes, and implements a custom exception class to encapsulate error details, facilitating structured error handling in an application.",
  "sources": "Enum class 'Exceptions' defining exception type strings, ERROR_CODES dictionary mapping exception types to status codes, and ApplicationException class reading exception_type, message, and errors as input parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or handle external data sources; it solely defines data structures and a class for internal use.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of ApplicationException with an exception type retrieves the corresponding error code from ERROR_CODES; no external data flows or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and standard for structured exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a clear enum for exception types, maps these to HTTP status codes, and creates a custom exception class that encapsulates error details. It does not handle external input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The design is typical for error management modules, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured exception handling setup with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
