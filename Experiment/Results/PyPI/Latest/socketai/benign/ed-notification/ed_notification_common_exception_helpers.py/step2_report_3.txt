  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues found; code is straightforward, defining enums, a mapping, and a custom exception class.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Risk justification:** The code is purely structural, with no external input or network activity, so a security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Malware concerns:** None, as no malicious activity or code patterns are detected.\n- **Assumptions:** The report correctly dismisses any potential vulnerabilities based on the code's simplicity.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; the code is standard for custom exception handling.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, matching the benign nature.\n- **Risk justification:** No external data or operations; risk score of 0 is justified.\n- **Malware concerns:** None.\n- **Assumptions:** The report correctly interprets the code as safe.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; straightforward enum and exception class.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk justification:** No external data handling or suspicious behavior; risk score of 0 is justified.\n- **Malware concerns:** None.\n- **Assumptions:** The report's conclusion that the code is benign is accurate.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard pattern.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n- **Risk justification:** No external or malicious activity; risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Malware concerns:** None.\n- **Assumptions:** The code is safe; the report's reasoning is sound.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; typical exception setup.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n- **Risk justification:** No external or malicious activity; risk score of 0 is justified.\n- **Malware concerns:** None.\n- **Assumptions:** The code is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, justified given the absence of external input, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the code's simplicity, clarity, and lack of any suspicious or malicious elements, I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n\n**However,** considering the possibility of future misuse or hidden malicious intent in such code patterns, I would assign a **very low** but non-zero risk score (e.g., 0.1) in a real-world scenario, but for this static review, 0 remains appropriate.\n\n**Final verdict:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threat based on the provided analysis.",
