  "purpose": "Configure a Python logger with multiple handlers and formatting for application logging.",
  "sources": "Imports logging and datetime modules; uses datetime.now(UTC) for timestamp in logger name.",
  "sinks": "Logger outputs to a file ('example.log') and console; no untrusted data input sources identified.",
  "flows": "Logger configuration flows from module import to setting handlers and formatters; no data flow from external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Uses datetime.now(UTC) for logger name, which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logger with a dynamic name incorporating the current UTC timestamp, adds a file handler and console handler with different severity levels, and formats logs consistently. No suspicious data handling or external network activities are present. The use of datetime in logger name is uncommon but not harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard logging setup without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate logging configuration for an application.",
