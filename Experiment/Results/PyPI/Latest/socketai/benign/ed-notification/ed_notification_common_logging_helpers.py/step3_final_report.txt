  "purpose": "Configure a logger with multiple handlers, formatting, and dynamic naming using current UTC timestamp.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; standard library functions used for logging and datetime.",
  "sinks": "Logger name creation; no untrusted data flows or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Logger initialization with dynamic name, handlers formatting, and level settings; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'datetime.now(UTC)' is unconventional; 'from datetime import UTC' is invalid, causing a runtime error.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a standard logging configuration with multiple handlers and a formatter. The use of 'datetime.now(UTC)' is unusual but not malicious; however, the import 'from datetime import UTC' is invalid, which would prevent execution. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The scores for malware and obfuscation are 0, and the security risk is minimal (around 0.1) due to the import error. The main concern is correcting the import statement to ensure proper runtime behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging setup with a minor bug in the import statement. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is very low, and the scores should reflect the absence of malicious intent. The primary recommendation is fixing the import to prevent runtime errors.",
