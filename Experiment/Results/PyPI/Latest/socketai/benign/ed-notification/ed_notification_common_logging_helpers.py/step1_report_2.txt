  "purpose": "Set up a logging system with multiple handlers and custom formatting for a Python application.",
  "sources": "Imports from logging, datetime, and usage of datetime.now(UTC) for logger name.",
  "sinks": "Logger writes to a file 'example.log' and outputs to console.",
  "flows": "Logging messages generated in the application are routed through handlers to file and console.",
  "anomalies": "Use of f-string with datetime.now(UTC) in logger name; no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger with a dynamic name incorporating the current UTC timestamp, sets up a file handler for error logs, and a console handler for info logs. The formatters are standard. No external data is read, nor are any untrusted inputs processed. The use of datetime.now(UTC) is for timestamping but does not involve any security-sensitive data or manipulation. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging setup with dynamic naming based on current UTC time. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
