  "purpose": "Configure a logger with multiple handlers and formatters for debugging and error reporting.",
  "sources": "Reading module name (__name__), current UTC time (datetime.now(UTC)), and file path ('example.log').",
  "sinks": "Logging output to console and file 'example.log'. No untrusted data or external inputs are directly processed.",
  "flows": "Module name and timestamp are used to label logs, which are then outputted to handlers; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of datetime.now(UTC) in logger name may cause dynamic logger naming, but this alone is not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a standard logging configuration with multiple handlers and formats. The logger name includes a timestamp, which dynamically changes, but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no external data sources, no code injection points, and no suspicious network activity. The use of logging and formatting appears typical for application diagnostics.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard logging setup without any malicious behavior or security risks. No indicators of sabotage, malware, or security issues are present.",
