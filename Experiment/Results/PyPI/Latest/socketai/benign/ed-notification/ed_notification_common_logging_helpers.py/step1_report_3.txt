  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python logger with file and console handlers, including formatting and log levels.",
  "sources": "datetime.now(UTC), user input (via logging), logger initialization",
  "sinks": "Logging output to 'example.log' and console",
  "flows": "logger creation -> handlers setup -> formatting -> log message output",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'UTC' from datetime import is incorrect; 'UTC' is not a valid attribute, which could cause an import error or misbehavior.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to set up logging with two handlers and a formatter. It imports 'UTC' from datetime, which does not exist in the standard library, leading to a potential import error or misconfigured timestamp in the logger's name. The logger is configured with different levels for handlers, which is typical. No user input, external data sources, or untrusted data are involved. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs. The primary concern is the incorrect import statement that would cause runtime failure, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code aims to configure logging but contains an invalid import statement ('from datetime import UTC') that would prevent proper execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, but the code would not run as intended due to this error.",
