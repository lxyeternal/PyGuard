{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility for data processing, possibly related to network communication or local data handling, but the exact purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from variables, functions, or imported modules; no explicit external data sources identified in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent or processed via functions that could output to network, files, or other systems; specific sinks are not clearly evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through various processing functions towards output sinks; no explicit source-to-sink path is clearly demonstrated due to limited code visibility.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets detected. The code does not contain obfuscated language features or unusual dynamic execution. However, the absence of context limits full certainty.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure shows typical data handling procedures, with no signs of malicious behavior such as system data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or cryptomining activities. It relies on standard library functions and common programming patterns. Without external context or additional code, it appears benign but lacks sufficient information to fully confirm intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the visible code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to perform standard data processing tasks. Due to limited context, confidence is moderate.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
