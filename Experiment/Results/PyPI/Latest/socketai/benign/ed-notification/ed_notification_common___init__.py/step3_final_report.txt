  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on supply chain security indicators.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), external modules, data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "System calls, network communications, environment variable access, file operations, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into dynamic execution or network modules, with no evidence of malicious payloads or exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, complex or obfuscated code structures, dynamic features that could be exploited, but no active malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits dynamic features like eval/exec and obfuscation, which are typical red flags but are not necessarily malicious. The code appears to perform standard data processing or utility functions without signs of malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or system sabotage. The presence of dynamic code execution warrants cautious scoring, but no active malicious activity is evident. The scores across reports are consistent with this assessment, with low malware likelihood and minimal obfuscation. The overall security risk remains low, with a slight increase due to the potential misuse of dynamic features, but no concrete threats identified.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code is benign based on current analysis, with no active malicious behavior or sabotage detected. The observed dynamic features and obfuscation are noted but do not constitute malicious intent. The security risk is low, and the supply chain appears secure.",
