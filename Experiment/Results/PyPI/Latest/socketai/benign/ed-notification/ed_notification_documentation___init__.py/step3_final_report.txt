  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, user input, network calls, dynamic evaluation, obfuscation patterns.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, dynamic code execution, data exfiltration pathways.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input flow into network or file sinks, potentially via dynamic evaluation or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, dynamic eval usage, network activity suspicious for data exfiltration, lack of comments or clarity, hardcoded strings or secrets if present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears mostly benign in reports 2 and 3, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns, leading to low malware and risk scores. Report 4 indicates signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network activity, justifying higher suspicion scores. Reports 1 and 5 lack code, so no analysis is possible. The scores across reports are consistent with their descriptions, with moderate suspicion in report 4. Overall, the evidence suggests low to moderate risk, with no definitive malicious activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no confirmed malicious behavior; suspicion is limited to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns in some reports. The overall security posture is low risk, with scores around 0.2 for malware, 0.3 for obfuscation, and 0.3 for security risk, reflecting cautious but justified assessments.",
