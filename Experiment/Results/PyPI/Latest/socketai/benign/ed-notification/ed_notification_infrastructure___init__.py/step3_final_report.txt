  "sources": "Standard input/output handling, data processing functions, environment variables, network connections, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file operations, environment variable access, data output.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (network, file, output).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected; code appears benign.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports indicate the code is benign, with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, aligning with the descriptions. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal concern given the lack of suspicious activity. Confidence levels are high where code is present and moderate where code is absent or limited. The reasoning across reports is consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code in all reports appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or adjustments are necessary at this time.",
