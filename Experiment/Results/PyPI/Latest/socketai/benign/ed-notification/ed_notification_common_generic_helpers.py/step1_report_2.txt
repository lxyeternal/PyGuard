  "purpose": "Load environment variables and generate UUIDs for application configuration and identification.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via os.getenv() for sensitive keys and connection strings.",
  "sinks": "Returning a dictionary with sensitive data such as API keys and connection strings.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and then their values are stored in a configuration dictionary which can be used elsewhere in the application.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual code patterns or obfuscated code; use of dotenv for configuration is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables using dotenv.load_dotenv() and retrieves various keys and connection strings. It generates UUIDs via uuid4(). The code does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or data exfiltration. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. All functions are straightforward and safe. The use of environment variables for configuration is common practice. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader and UUID generator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
