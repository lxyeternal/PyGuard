  "purpose": "Load environment variables for configuration and generate UUIDs for unique identifiers.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.getenv() after load_dotenv() is called.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; environment variables are used for configuration data, which may be utilized downstream.",
  "flows": "get_config() loads environment variables, which are then used as configuration values; get_new_id() generates UUIDs without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables securely using dotenv, provides a UUID generator, and returns configuration data. It does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or contain malicious code. The use of environment variables for sensitive data is standard practice. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader and UUID generator with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
