{
  "purpose": "The code loads environment variables and provides functions to generate UUIDs and retrieve configuration settings for a larger application.",
  "sources": "os.getenv calls to read environment variables such as RESEND_KEY, MONGO_DB_KEY, DB_NAME, INFOBIG_KEY, RABBITMQ_URL, and RABBITMQ_QUEUE.",
  "sinks": "The environment variables could be used later in the application to connect to databases, messaging queues, or external APIs, but this code itself does not directly execute sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "get_config reads environment variables (sources) and returns a configuration dictionary (potential sink). The flow is from environment variable retrieval to configuration usage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated parts, or unusual constructs. It simply loads environment variables and provides a UUID generator.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a UUID generator function, and a configuration loader that pulls environment variables using dotenv. The variables are returned as a dictionary, which can be used elsewhere. No input validation, no secret handling beyond environment variables, and no code injection or malicious payloads are present. The use of environment variables is standard practice for managing secrets and configuration, and no suspicious or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic configuration loading and UUID generation without any signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe utility code segment.",
