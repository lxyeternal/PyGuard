  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a simple version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string value to __version__, a common practice in Python packages to specify the package version. It contains only a single line, with no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The code is standard boilerplate for package versioning and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package version declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
