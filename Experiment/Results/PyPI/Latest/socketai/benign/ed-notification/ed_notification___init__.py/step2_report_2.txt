  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code only assigns a string to the `__version__` variable. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions. This is standard boilerplate in Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:  \n   No errors or flaws are identified in any report. The code is minimal, straightforward, and free of suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores Review**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely a version declaration with no malicious activity, higher scores are unwarranted. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid assumptions beyond the code's visible behavior. They correctly identify that the code is benign.\n\n6. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and match the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**My estimated scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis above.",
