  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment in code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. No inputs, outputs, or external data interactions are present. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code does not perform any actions that could pose security risks or contain malicious payloads. The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security issues or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
