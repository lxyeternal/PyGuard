  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for notification API client operations.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and defines abstract methods; no input reading in this code fragment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data processing or external communication in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; this is purely an abstract class with method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and project-specific modules, then defines an abstract class with method signatures for notification operations. There are no concrete implementations, data handling, or external communications. No security issues or malicious behaviors are evident in this abstract interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward abstract interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a contract for subclasses implementing notification-related API interactions.",
