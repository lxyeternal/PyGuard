  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for notification API clients with methods for sending, retrieving, and updating notifications.",
  "sources": "No data sources; abstract method signatures only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; abstract method signatures without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward interface definition with standard Python constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a pure abstract base class with method signatures for notification operations, using standard Python features and project-specific DTOs. It contains no data processing, external calls, or logic that could introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as a benign interface with no obfuscation or security issues. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriately set to 0, and confidence is high. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign interface definition for notification API clients. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The scores are consistent with its nature, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
