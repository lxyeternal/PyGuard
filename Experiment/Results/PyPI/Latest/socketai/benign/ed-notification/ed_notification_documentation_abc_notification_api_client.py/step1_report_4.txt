  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for notification API client with methods for sending, retrieving, and updating notifications.",
  "sources": "None; the code imports modules and defines class and method signatures without reading untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no direct data outputs or handling untrusted input within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present; this is purely interface definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be a straightforward abstract class definition with proper use of Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and project-specific modules to define an abstract class with abstract methods for notification operations. It does not process or handle any input data or perform operations that could be malicious. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behavior. The code serves as an interface blueprint for implementations elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured abstract class defining interface methods for notification operations. It contains no malicious code, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign component of a larger application.",
