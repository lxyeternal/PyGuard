{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for notification API client operations, including sending, retrieving, and updating notifications.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'abc', 'uuid', and application-specific modules; class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; methods are abstract and meant to be implemented elsewhere.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow occurs within this code; it's a class interface without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code strictly defines abstract methods with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and project-specific modules, defines an abstract class with abstract methods for notification operations, and specifies input/output types. No data processing or logic occurs here. It serves as a contract for subclasses. No source-to-sink data flow is present, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It acts as a template for notification-related API clients.",
