  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines an abstract base class (`ABCNotificationApiClient`) with abstract methods for sending, retrieving, and updating notifications.\n   - It uses standard Python features (`abc`, `UUID`, type annotations) and imports project-specific DTOs and response classes.\n   - There are no concrete implementations, data processing, or external calls in this snippet.\n   - The code acts solely as an interface or contract for subclasses.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns**:\n   - The code does not process untrusted data directly.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or external system interactions.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Malware & Obfuscation Scores**:\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0.\n   - This aligns with the code's nature as a straightforward interface definition.\n\n4. **Risk Scores**:\n   - The reports assign a security risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities.\n   - No reason to adjust these scores; the code is benign.\n\n5. **Analysis of Logical Flaws or Errors**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that this is a standard interface class with no malicious or suspicious features.\n   - No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the logic or reasoning.\n\n6. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores**:\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security issues or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a benign, standard abstract class serving as an interface for notification API clients. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My personal estimate** aligns with the reports: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.",
