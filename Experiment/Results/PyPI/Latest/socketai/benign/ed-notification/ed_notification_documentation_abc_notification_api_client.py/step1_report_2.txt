{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract API client interface for notification operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (abc, uuid) and local modules for API responses and DTOs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks of untrusted data or external system calls; purely interface declarations.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to method definitions accepting DTOs and IDs, returning API responses.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract base class for notification API interactions. It defines method signatures for sending, retrieving, and updating notifications, with appropriate type annotations. No dynamic code execution, no input/output operations, and no external system interactions are present. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as an interface or contract for implementing classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface definition with no malicious intent or security issues. It functions as a contract for notification operations without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
