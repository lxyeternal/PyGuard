{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for notification API clients with methods for sending, retrieving, and updating notifications.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules and the class definition with abstract methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present as the code does not process untrusted data directly or execute code based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard Python features for defining abstract classes and type annotations. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious patterns, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines an abstract class with method signatures for notification operations. There are no input handling, data processing, or external calls within this snippet that could indicate malicious behavior. The code structure is typical for an interface definition in a service layer, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard interface definition for notification services with no malicious intent or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious or maliciously sabotaged, serving purely as a contract for implementing classes.",
