{
  "purpose": "Defines API endpoint descriptions for notification operations, using static URL templates with UUID path parameters.",
  "sources": "UUIDs used in URL path parameters; class variables for base URL; imported DTO classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data handling; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "URL path templates incorporate UUIDs; no runtime data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward static configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs endpoint descriptions with static URL paths and DTO references, with UUIDs as path parameters. It does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. All signs point to a configuration module for API endpoints, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The use of UUIDs is standard practice. No obfuscation or data leaks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static configuration for API endpoints with no malicious intent or security issues. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
