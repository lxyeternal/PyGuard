  "purpose": "Define API endpoints for notification-related operations, including sending, retrieving, and updating notifications.",
  "sources": "Reading input parameters such as UUIDs from URL path variables and possibly request bodies based on the DTOs.",
  "sinks": "Constructed URL paths that incorporate UUIDs for API requests.",
  "flows": "UUIDs from function inputs are embedded into URL strings for API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The use of UUIDs appears standard for resource identification.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that creates endpoint descriptions with URL paths containing UUIDs. No input handling beyond URL parameter specification is present. No external data reading, file access, or network communication is directly implemented here. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration of API endpoint metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Usage of UUIDs for IDs and endpoint descriptions aligns with typical REST API design practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a configuration for API endpoints related to notifications. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. There are no security risks apparent within this code segment.",
