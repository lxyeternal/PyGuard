{
  "purpose": "Define API endpoints for notification operations including sending, retrieving, and updating notifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data such as 'base_url' and class attributes; it imports modules but does not read untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "Constructed URL paths for HTTP requests; no direct use of untrusted data in these URLs at runtime.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no runtime data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, and no dynamic code execution. The code structure appears standard for an API client endpoint definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that sets up static API endpoint descriptions using provided base URL and UUID-based path parameters. It employs standard data types and methods for describing API endpoints. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or unusual behavior. No input handling from external sources at runtime, nor suspicious data manipulation, is present. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration class for API endpoints.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical endpoint configuration class with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
