  "purpose": "Define an API endpoint class for handling notification-related HTTP requests",
  "sources": "The class itself and the string formatting of URL paths with class variables and UUIDs",
  "sinks": "The URL path strings used in HTTP requests, potentially involving user-provided UUIDs",
  "flows": "UUIDs from input flow into URL paths used for HTTP requests",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and appears to generate REST API endpoint descriptions.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a class representing notification API endpoints, dynamically generating URL paths with UUIDs for resource identification. It imports standard libraries and uses well-defined DTOs and HTTP methods. No user input is directly processed or embedded into the URL paths beyond UUID formatting, which is standard for REST APIs. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. There are no signs of backdoors, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API endpoint definition with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply constructs endpoint descriptions for use in a larger application. There are no security risks identified.",
