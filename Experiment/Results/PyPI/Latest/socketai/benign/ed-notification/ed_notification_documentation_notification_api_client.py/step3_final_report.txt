  "purpose": "A Python API client wrapper for notification operations, facilitating sending, retrieving, and updating notifications via external endpoints.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as UUIDs, DTOs, and endpoint descriptions retrieved dynamically.",
  "sinks": "API requests constructed with method inputs; no untrusted data directly affecting system state beyond API calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into API request payloads and path parameters, passing through dictionaries into ApiClient calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client class that encapsulates notification-related API calls. It uses external endpoint descriptions and DTOs for data transfer, passing them into a generic ApiClient for HTTP requests. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The data flows are straightforward, and the code relies on external modules assumed to be secure. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external API interactions, but no vulnerabilities are evident within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, typical API client implementation with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting standard API interaction risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
