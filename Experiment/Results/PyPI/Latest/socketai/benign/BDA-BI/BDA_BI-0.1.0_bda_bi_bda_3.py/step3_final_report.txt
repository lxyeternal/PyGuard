{
  "purpose": "The code processes student grades using Hadoop streaming with Python scripts: 'mapper.py' extracts student IDs and marks, 'reducer.py' computes averages and assigns grades. It reads CSV input, skips headers, and outputs student ID, average, and grade.",
  "sources": "Input data read from stdin in 'mapper.py' and 'reducer.py'; data read from 'input.txt' during setup.",
  "sinks": "Output written to stdout in 'mapper.py' and 'reducer.py'; final results stored in Hadoop output directory.",
  "flows": "Input CSV data -> 'mapper.py' extracts student_id and marks -> data passed via Hadoop streaming -> 'reducer.py' aggregates marks per student -> computes averages and grades -> outputs final student ID, average, grade.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The scripts are standard Hadoop streaming Python programs for data processing. 'mapper.py' reads CSV, skips headers, outputs tab-separated student_id and marks. 'reducer.py' reads sorted input, aggregates marks per student, computes averages, assigns grades based on thresholds, and outputs results. No suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation present. The environment setup and commands are typical for Hadoop jobs. The code's simplicity and transparency indicate no malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis. No security concerns are identified, and the code is safe for deployment.",
