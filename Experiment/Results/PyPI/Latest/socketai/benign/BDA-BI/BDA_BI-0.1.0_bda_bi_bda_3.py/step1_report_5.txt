{
  "purpose": "The code processes student grade data using Hadoop MapReduce, transforming input CSV data into aggregated grades and letter grades.",
  "sources": "Reads data from sys.stdin in mapper.py and reducer.py, and from the file input.txt via Hadoop HDFS commands.",
  "sinks": "Outputs results to stdout and HDFS; no direct sink for untrusted data to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from input.txt through Hadoop streaming, processed in mapper.py and reducer.py, and finally output to HDFS.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard practices for Hadoop streaming. No suspicious or malicious code segments identified.",
  "analysis": "The scripts are simple data processing scripts for Hadoop MapReduce: mapper.py extracts student ID and marks, reducer.py computes averages and assigns grades. Both scripts read from stdin and write to stdout, which is typical for Hadoop streaming jobs. The code does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious functions, or suspicious logic are present. The HDFS commands and job submission appear standard for Hadoop workflows. Overall, the code is a straightforward data processing pipeline with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Hadoop MapReduce implementation for processing student grades. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, correctly structured, and intended for legitimate data processing purposes.",
