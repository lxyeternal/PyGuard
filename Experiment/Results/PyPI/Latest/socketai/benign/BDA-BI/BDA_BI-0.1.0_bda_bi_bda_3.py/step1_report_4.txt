{
  "purpose": "Process student grades data through a MapReduce job to compute averages and assign grades.",
  "sources": "sys.stdin (reading input data), input.txt file (initial data source), environment variables (via shebang), Hadoop commands (external command execution).",
  "sinks": "Printing to stdout (mapper and reducer outputs), Hadoop filesystem commands, no direct untrusted data sinks found within the code itself.",
  "flows": "Input data from input.txt flows into the mapper, output of mapper flows into the reducer via stdin, reducer outputs results to stdout, which are stored in Hadoop filesystem.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code appears straightforward and typical for Hadoop streaming jobs. No signs of malicious data exfiltration, network activity, or system manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two Python scripts (mapper.py and reducer.py) used in a Hadoop streaming job. The mapper reads input lines, skips headers, and outputs student_id and marks. The reducer calculates averages and assigns grades, then outputs results. The overall process is a standard data processing pipeline with no embedded malicious logic. External commands for filesystem setup and Hadoop job execution are standard administrative commands. No hardcoded secrets, insecure practices, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The use of shebangs, environment variables, and straightforward input/output handling is typical. All code appears benign and purpose-driven for data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Hadoop streaming job with Python scripts for mapping and reducing student grade data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The scripts perform their intended functions securely and transparently.",
