{
  "purpose": "The code processes student grades using Hadoop MapReduce, reading input data, mapping, reducing, and outputting results.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from stdin in mapper, and from input.txt file; reads input data from HDFS input directory; no external input beyond the provided dataset.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout (console) and HDFS output directory; no external untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data read from stdin and input.txt -> processed in mapper.py -> piped to reducer.py -> output stored in HDFS output directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or obfuscated code. The code structure is straightforward and consistent with standard Hadoop streaming jobs.",
  "analysis": "The mapper reads CSV input, skips headers, and outputs student_id and marks; the reducer computes averages and grades per student. Both scripts are simple and contain no malicious or suspicious code segments. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors are detected. The entire process is a typical data processing pipeline with no anomalies indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Hadoop streaming job for processing student grades, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign educational or analytical script. Overall, the code is safe and free from supply chain security issues.",
