{
  "purpose": "This code processes student grade data using Hadoop MapReduce with Python scripts for mapping and reducing, to calculate average scores and grades.",
  "sources": "Input data read from sys.stdin in mapper.py, and input.txt loaded into Hadoop HDFS; no untrusted external sources are explicitly used in the code.",
  "sinks": "Output is written to Hadoop HDFS, specifically in /output_grades; no direct data leakage points are evident within the scripts themselves.",
  "flows": "Input data from input.txt is uploaded to HDFS, then streamed through mapper.py and reducer.py via Hadoop streaming; intermediate data flows from mapper to reducer via standard input/output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or obfuscated elements; scripts are straightforward, with clear data processing logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The scripts are standard for a Hadoop streaming job: mapper.py extracts student_id and marks, outputting tab-separated pairs; reducer.py aggregates marks per student, computes averages, and assigns grades. The code performs typical data processing without suspicious logic. No external network calls, environment variable misuse, or hidden backdoors are detected. The code adheres to conventional patterns for Hadoop MapReduce tasks and contains no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate data processing workflow for student grades with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations with standard Python scripts within a Hadoop environment, and no malicious or suspicious code elements are identified.",
