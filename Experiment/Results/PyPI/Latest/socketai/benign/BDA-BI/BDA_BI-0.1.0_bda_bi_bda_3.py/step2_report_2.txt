  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as straightforward, standard Hadoop streaming jobs in Python.\n- No suspicious or malicious code segments, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are mentioned.\n- The code's logic is simple: parsing CSV, skipping headers, computing averages, assigning grades.\n- No network activity, external data exfiltration, or backdoors are identified.\n- The environment setup and Hadoop commands are standard administrative procedures.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Code Presence\n\n- The code snippets for `mapper.py` and `reducer.py` are present and match the descriptions.\n- Input data in `input.txt` is straightforward.\n- The process flow from input to output via Hadoop streaming is correctly outlined.\n\n**Conclusion:** The core code is present, functional, and aligns with the descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic\n\n- The reports are accurate in their description; they do not claim anything that isn't supported by the code.\n- No logical errors or misleading claims are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify the scripts as simple data processing tools with no malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning is sound and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Their Reasonableness\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0. Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1. Given the absence of vulnerabilities, this is reasonable.\n\n**Suggestions:**  \n- The report with a 0.1 security risk score could be lowered to 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky practices are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5\n\n- None of the reports assign scores above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- If any report had assigned higher scores, I would require justification based on code behavior, which is not the case here.\n\n### Potential Assumptions and Claims\n\n- All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they rely on observed code behavior.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious activity are based on unsupported assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of Scores with Content\n\n- All scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The high confidence levels (mostly 1) are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment & Personal Estimation\n\nBased on the review:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no vulnerabilities or security issues)\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a standard, transparent Hadoop streaming job with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security flaws.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n| Score Type        | Estimated Score | Justification                                               |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior present                       |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                 | Code is clear and understandable                            |\n| Security Risk     | 0                 | No vulnerabilities, secrets, or risky practices detected  |\n\n**Final note:** All reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
