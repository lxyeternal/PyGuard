  "purpose": "Process student grades data using Hadoop streaming with custom mapper and reducer scripts in Python.",
  "sources": "sys.stdin in mapper.py and reducer.py reading input data; input.txt file containing grades data.",
  "sinks": "Print statements in mapper.py and reducer.py outputting processed data; no untrusted data output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data from input.txt flows into Hadoop, then mapped and reduced, with output written back to HDFS.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code or obfuscated logic; standard Hadoop streaming process.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a MapReduce job for processing student grades. The mapper reads input lines, skips headers, and outputs student_id and marks. The reducer aggregates marks per student, computes averages, assigns grades, and outputs results. No malicious or suspicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The scripts do not contain obfuscation, code injection, or hidden behaviors. Usage of environment variables and standard Python libraries appears benign. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected. The code relies on standard Hadoop streaming tools and Python scripts for data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical data processing for student grades without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign Hadoop streaming job using Python scripts. No malicious behavior or security threats identified.",
