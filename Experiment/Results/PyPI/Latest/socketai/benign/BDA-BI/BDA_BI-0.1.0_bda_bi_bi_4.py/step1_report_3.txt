  "purpose": "This code loads the Titanic dataset, preprocesses data, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance for predictive modeling.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'titanic.csv' using pandas.read_csv().",
  "sinks": "Outputs printed to the console: accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.",
  "flows": "Reads 'titanic.csv' -> preprocesses data -> trains model -> makes predictions -> prints evaluation metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious data handling observed. The dataset filename is hardcoded but typical for analysis scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a dataset, performs standard preprocessing (filling missing values, encoding categorical variables), splits data, trains a logistic regression model, and outputs evaluation metrics. There is no code that reads untrusted input during runtime, no network activity, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data handling. The use of pandas and scikit-learn libraries is standard and appropriate for data analysis tasks. The code appears to be a typical ML pipeline with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward data analysis and model training task with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign implementation of a machine learning pipeline for Titanic dataset classification.",
