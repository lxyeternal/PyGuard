  "purpose": "Train and evaluate a machine learning model (Logistic Regression) on the Titanic dataset for classification.",
  "sources": "Reads 'titanic.csv' dataset from the local file system.",
  "sinks": "Outputs evaluation metrics to standard output (console).",
  "flows": "Reads CSV file -> Processes data -> Trains model -> Outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or hidden backdoors detected. Usage of common libraries and straightforward data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a dataset, performs typical preprocessing steps including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, splits data into train/test sets, trains a logistic regression model, and prints evaluation metrics. All operations are standard ML procedures with no external data fetching, no suspicious code, and no obfuscated logic. No signs of malicious behavior or malware are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate machine learning script intended for training and evaluating a predictive model on the Titanic dataset. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
