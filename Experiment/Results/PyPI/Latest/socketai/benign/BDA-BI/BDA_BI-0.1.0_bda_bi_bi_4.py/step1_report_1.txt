  "purpose": "This code loads, preprocesses, and trains a logistic regression model on the Titanic dataset for survival prediction.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'titanic.csv' file using pandas.read_csv().",
  "sinks": "Outputs model evaluation metrics to the console via print statements.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from the CSV file, processed locally, used for training, then predictions are made and results printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a dataset from a local CSV file, performs standard preprocessing (handling missing data, encoding categorical variables), splits the data into training and testing sets, trains a logistic regression model, and outputs evaluation metrics. All operations are standard for a machine learning pipeline. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or suspicious code constructs. The file reading is local and straightforward, with no user input or untrusted data sources beyond the CSV file. The output is simply printed to the console, with no external or insecure data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical machine learning workflow with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign data analysis script for Titanic survival prediction.",
