  "purpose": "This code loads Titanic data, preprocesses it, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance.",
  "sources": "Reads 'titanic.csv' from local filesystem",
  "sinks": "Outputs evaluation metrics to console",
  "flows": "Data read from file -> preprocessing -> model training -> prediction -> evaluation output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded filename is standard; no obfuscation or malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward ML pipeline with standard data handling and model evaluation. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The filename is hardcoded but typical; no secrets or credentials are embedded. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious constructs indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data science script with no malicious or security risks. The only minor point is the hardcoded filename, which does not constitute a security concern in this context.",
