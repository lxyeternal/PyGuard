{
  "purpose": "The code loads the Titanic dataset, preprocesses data, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'titanic.csv' using pd.read_csv, and processes data within pandas DataFrame operations.",
  "sinks": "Uses sklearn functions for model training and evaluation; no untrusted data output or external network connections.",
  "flows": "Data read from file (source) flows through preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation steps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard data loading, cleaning, feature encoding, model training, and evaluation. It utilizes common libraries and functions for data science tasks without suspicious or malicious logic. No data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection observed. All code appears typical for a machine learning pipeline, with proper handling of missing data and straightforward model evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal machine learning workflow with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any suspicious or malicious code segments, nor does it perform any unauthorized actions.",
