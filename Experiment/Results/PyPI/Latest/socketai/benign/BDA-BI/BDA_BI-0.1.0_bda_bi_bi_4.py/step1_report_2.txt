  "purpose": "This code loads the Titanic dataset, preprocesses it, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'titanic.csv' using pd.read_csv().",
  "sinks": "The code outputs evaluation metrics to the console via print statements.",
  "flows": "Data is read from a CSV file, processed, split into train/test sets, used to train a model, and then predictions are made and evaluated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code uses common libraries and functions for data analysis and modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code loads data from a CSV, handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, splits data, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates it with standard metrics. No suspicious or malicious activities are evident. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward data science workflow for Titanic dataset classification, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
