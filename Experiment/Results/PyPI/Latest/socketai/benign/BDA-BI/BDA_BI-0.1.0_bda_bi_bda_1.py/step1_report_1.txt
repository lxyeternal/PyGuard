{
  "purpose": "The code implements a basic Hadoop MapReduce job for word count analysis.",
  "sources": "Input is read from standard input (sys.stdin) in mapper.py, and from the HDFS input file input.txt. Data is retrieved from HDFS in commands like hadoop fs -cat.",
  "sinks": "Output is written to HDFS output directory; no external data sinks or network connections are directly present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input file into HDFS, then through the mapper.py via stdin, processed, then passed to reducer.py via stdin, and finally stored back in HDFS.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behaviors. The scripts are standard MapReduce components. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected. No unusual or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The scripts are typical Python implementations for a word count MapReduce job. They read data from stdin, process it, and output results. The commands involve standard Hadoop operations to set up directories, upload input files, run the job, and list output. No suspicious code elements, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Hadoop MapReduce implementation for word counting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The code performs intended data processing tasks securely within expected parameters.",
