  "purpose": "Standard Hadoop MapReduce word count implementation using Python scripts for mapper and reducer.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from stdin during execution of mapper.py and reducer.py scripts.",
  "sinks": "Outputs word counts to stdout; data flows through Hadoop's distributed processing system.",
  "flows": "Input data -> mapper.py (stdin) -> shuffle/sort -> reducer.py (stdin) -> output to HDFS.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward Python scripts for a word count job, with standard Hadoop commands for setup and execution. No obfuscation, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The scripts process input data, count words, and output results as expected. The commands used are typical for Hadoop streaming jobs. No vulnerabilities or malicious indicators are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Hadoop MapReduce word count implementation with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
