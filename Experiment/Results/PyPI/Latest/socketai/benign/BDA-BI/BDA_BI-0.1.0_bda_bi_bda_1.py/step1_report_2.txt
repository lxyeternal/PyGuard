{
  "purpose": "The provided code implements a simple MapReduce job using Hadoop streaming to count word frequencies from an input text file.",
  "sources": "Reading input from sys.stdin in mapper.py; reading input.txt file for initial data; Hadoop commands reading from HDFS and writing output to HDFS.",
  "sinks": "Output is printed to standard output in mapper.py and reducer.py; data is transferred over network via Hadoop framework.",
  "flows": "Input text is read from input.txt, processed by mapper.py (word splitting), passed to Hadoop, shuffled and sorted, then processed by reducer.py, and output stored in HDFS.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors identified. The code is straightforward and typical for a MapReduce word count job. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard input reading and word counting; it uses environment shebangs and simple print statements; no external network connections or sensitive data handling; Hadoop commands are typical for managing data and job execution. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The code is clean, straightforward, and aligns with common big data processing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard MapReduce word count implementation with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It functions as intended for processing large datasets in a distributed environment without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
