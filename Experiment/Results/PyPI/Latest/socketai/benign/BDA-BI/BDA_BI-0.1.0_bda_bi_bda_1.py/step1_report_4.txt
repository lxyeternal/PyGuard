{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple MapReduce job using Hadoop streaming to count word frequencies in a text input.",
  "sources": "The input text file 'input.txt' uploaded to HDFS, read by the mapper script from standard input.",
  "sinks": "Output of the reducer written to HDFS at '/output/part-00000', which can be viewed via 'hadoop fs -cat'.",
  "flows": "Input text -> mapper.py reads from stdin -> mapper outputs key-value pairs -> Hadoop shuffle and sort -> reducer.py reads from stdin -> outputs final counts to HDFS.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The scripts are straightforward, standard Hadoop streaming mappers and reducers.",
  "analysis": "The scripts implement a basic word count MapReduce task. The mapper reads from stdin, splits lines into words, and outputs each word with a count of 1. The reducer aggregates counts for each word and outputs the total. No external network connections, no handling of sensitive data, and no obfuscated or malicious code features are present. The overall structure aligns with typical Hadoop word count jobs. No anomalies or suspicious activities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a Hadoop streaming word count job with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be intended for legitimate big data processing purposes.",
