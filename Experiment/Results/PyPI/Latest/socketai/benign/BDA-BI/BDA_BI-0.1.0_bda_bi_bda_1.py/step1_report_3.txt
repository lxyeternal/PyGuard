{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple Hadoop MapReduce word count job, reading input, mapping words to counts, reducing counts, and executing the job on Hadoop cluster.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'input.txt' via 'hadoop fs -put' command, standard input in mapper.py, and data read from HDFS during processing.",
  "sinks": "Output data written to HDFS with 'hadoop fs -cat' command, no network or data exfiltration directly visible, no system commands for external communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input file to mapper.py via stdin, then to reducer.py via stdin, then output is stored in HDFS and read back via 'hadoop fs -cat'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code present. The scripts are straightforward, standard Hadoop streaming map and reduce scripts, with no hardcoded credentials, no network calls, no obfuscated code, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Python scripts for MapReduce operations, both reading from stdin and writing to stdout. The mapper splits input lines into words and outputs each with a count of 1, while the reducer aggregates counts for each word. The rest of the commands perform typical Hadoop file system operations and job execution. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The scripts follow standard patterns for Hadoop streaming jobs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a Hadoop MapReduce word count job with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs standard data processing tasks without any suspicious or malicious activities.",
