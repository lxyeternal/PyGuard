{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple MapReduce word count job using Hadoop streaming, with Python scripts as mapper and reducer.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input (sys.stdin) in mapper.py and reducer.py; input.txt is uploaded to HDFS, which is then processed.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs word counts to standard output, stored in HDFS; no untrusted data flows into external systems or sensitive areas within the code itself.",
  "flows": "Input data from HDFS is read by the mapper; mapper outputs are piped to the reducer; reducer outputs are stored back to HDFS.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The scripts are straightforward and typical for Hadoop streaming.",
  "analysis": "The scripts perform standard word count operations, splitting input lines into words, counting occurrences, and outputting results. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code behavior is detected. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, network connections, or system modifications. It relies on Hadoop infrastructure for execution. The overall process appears to be a typical MapReduce job for text processing.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of a Hadoop streaming word count task. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe for use in a legitimate big data processing context.",
