{
  "purpose": "The code implements a MapReduce process for matrix multiplication using Hadoop streaming with Python scripts for the mapper and reducer.",
  "sources": "Reads data from sys.stdin (input lines from Hadoop streaming), and hardcoded input data in input.txt",
  "sinks": "Outputs key-value pairs via print statements in mapper and reducer; final results written to HDFS output directory",
  "flows": "Input data -> mapper.py (parses and emits key-value pairs) -> Hadoop shuffle and sort -> reducer.py (computes matrix multiplication results) -> output to HDFS",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls detected. Code uses standard Hadoop streaming mechanisms. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or secret exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard matrix multiplication in a distributed manner. Mapper reads input lines, parses matrix identifiers and values, and emits intermediate key-value pairs for the reduce phase. Reducer collects values per key, computes the partial products, and outputs results. The scripts contain typical Python code with no suspicious functions, network calls, or data leaks. No use of insecure practices like SQL injection or unsafe environment variable usage. The code aligns with common Hadoop streaming practices, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided scripts implement a standard MapReduce matrix multiplication workflow without any malicious or suspicious code features. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage in the code. The code appears secure and intended solely for distributed matrix computation.",
