{
  "purpose": "The code implements a MapReduce job for matrix multiplication using Hadoop streaming with Python scripts as mapper and reducer.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from sys.stdin, specifically lines from input.txt containing matrix entries, and environment variables used by the shell commands.",
  "sinks": "Outputs processed data via print statements to sys.stdout, which are captured by Hadoop for the MapReduce process; no external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input lines are read and parsed; data flows from sys.stdin into mapper.py, then outputs from mapper.py flow into Hadoop's shuffle and sort, then into reducer.py, and finally produce the result output in HDFS.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward with standard MapReduce logic; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. No dynamic code execution or malicious system calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The mapper.py reads matrix entries and generates key-value pairs for matrix multiplication; the reducer.py aggregates these pairs to compute the product. Both scripts perform typical data processing without malicious behavior. The code is standard for a Hadoop streaming matrix multiplication task, with no signs of data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The use of print statements for output and standard Python libraries indicates normal operation. No external network connections or system modifications are evident. The process involves reading inputs, processing, and outputting results as expected in a distributed computing context.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code performs a standard Hadoop streaming matrix multiplication task with Python scripts and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate educational or computational code with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
