  "purpose": "The code implements a MapReduce job for matrix multiplication using Hadoop Streaming with Python scripts as mapper and reducer.",
  "sources": "Input data from stdin in mapper.py; data read from input.txt and Hadoop filesystem in the workflow.",
  "sinks": "Output data to stdout in mapper and reducer; Hadoop filesystem output directory.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from stdin in mapper.py, processed, and emitted with keys; reducer.py reads key-value pairs, aggregates, and outputs results; data flows from input.txt through Hadoop job to output directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity observed. Code appears standard for Hadoop Streaming jobs. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution beyond normal Python script behavior. No signs of data exfiltration, reverse shells, or malicious system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The scripts implement a standard MapReduce job for matrix multiplication. mapper.py processes each input line, emitting key-value pairs for matrix elements. reducer.py aggregates these pairs to compute matrix product entries. The workflow uses Hadoop commands to set up input, run the job, and retrieve results. The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior; it adheres to typical data processing patterns. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or harmful code are present. The scripts rely on standard Python libraries and common Hadoop utilities. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate, intended for distributed matrix computation, with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate distributed matrix multiplication using Hadoop Streaming with Python scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a standard implementation of a MapReduce job for data processing purposes.",
