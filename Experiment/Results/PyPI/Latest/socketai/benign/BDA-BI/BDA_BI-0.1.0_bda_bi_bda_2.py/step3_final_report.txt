{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Hadoop streaming MapReduce job for matrix multiplication, processing input data to generate key-value pairs and compute the product.",
  "sources": "Reads matrix entries from stdin (standard input), specifically lines with matrix identifier, indices, and values.",
  "sinks": "Outputs key-value pairs to stdout, which are then processed by the reducer; no external network or system modifications are involved.",
  "flows": "Input lines (matrix, i, j, value) -> Mapper generates key-value pairs based on matrix type -> Reducer aggregates and computes the matrix product based on keys.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network calls, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The scripts follow typical patterns for distributed matrix multiplication. The mapper parses input lines, generates key-value pairs for matrix entries, and the reducer multiplies corresponding elements. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. The data flow is standard, and the environment setup is typical for Hadoop jobs. No external network activity or system modifications are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of Hadoop streaming for matrix multiplication. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. The scores and assessments are justified and appropriate.",
