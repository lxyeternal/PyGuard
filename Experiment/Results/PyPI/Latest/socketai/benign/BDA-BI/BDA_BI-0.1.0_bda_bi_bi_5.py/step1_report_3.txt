  "purpose": "Perform K-Means clustering analysis on the Iris dataset for visualization and understanding of clusters.",
  "sources": "Reads data from sklearn.datasets.load_iris(), reads feature data from iris.data, reads input for StandardScaler.fit_transform(), uses model.fit(), and accesses cluster centers from kmeans.cluster_centers_.",
  "sinks": "Outputs cluster centers via print(), and visualizes data with matplotlib.pyplot.scatter() and plt.show().",
  "flows": "Loads data from sklearn datasets -> scales data with StandardScaler -> applies KMeans clustering -> assigns labels -> visualizes clusters -> prints cluster centers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden network activities. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward data analysis code. No indication of data leakage, malicious injections, or code that communicates externally.",
  "analysis": "The code loads the Iris dataset, preprocesses features using StandardScaler, applies KMeans clustering with 3 clusters, and visualizes the results using matplotlib. It then prints the cluster centers. All steps involve standard data analysis procedures with well-known libraries. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The use of print statements and visualization libraries is typical for data analysis scripts. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code paths, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard data clustering analysis on a publicly available dataset without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It solely outputs clustering results and visualizations. No security risks or malware signals detected.",
