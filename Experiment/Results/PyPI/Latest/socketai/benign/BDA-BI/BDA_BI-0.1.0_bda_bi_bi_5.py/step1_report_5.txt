  "purpose": "Perform K-Means clustering on the Iris dataset for analysis and visualization.",
  "sources": "Reading the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.load_iris(), using StandardScaler to normalize data, and printing cluster centers.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs cluster centers; no untrusted data or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from a trusted dataset source, processed locally, and results are displayed or printed without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a standard dataset, applies standard preprocessing, performs clustering, visualizes results, and prints cluster centers. All steps are typical for data analysis. No external network communication, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate data clustering and visualization without any malicious intent or security risks.",
