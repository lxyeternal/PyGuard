  "purpose": "Perform K-Means clustering on the Iris dataset to analyze its features and visualize the results.",
  "sources": "Dataset loading from sklearn.datasets.load_iris(), input features from iris.data, data manipulation with pandas, and visualization with matplotlib.",
  "sinks": "Outputting cluster centers and labels, displaying a scatter plot, and printing cluster centers to standard output.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from sklearn, processed with StandardScaler, fed into KMeans, then cluster labels are added to a DataFrame, and results are printed and plotted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious data flows or obfuscated code detected. The code follows standard data analysis procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script loads the Iris dataset, standardizes features, applies K-Means clustering, adds labels to a DataFrame, visualizes clusters, and prints cluster centers. All operations are typical for machine learning analysis with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No network activity, system modifications, or suspicious data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data analysis script for clustering the Iris dataset, with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
