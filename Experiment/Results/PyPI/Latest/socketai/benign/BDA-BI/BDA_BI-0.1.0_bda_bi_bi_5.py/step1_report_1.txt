{
  "purpose": "Perform unsupervised clustering analysis on the Iris dataset using KMeans, including data preprocessing, clustering, visualization, and reporting cluster centers.",
  "sources": "Loading dataset with sklearn.datasets.load_iris(), reading feature data from the dataset, and standardizing data with StandardScaler.",
  "sinks": "Printing cluster centers, displaying a scatter plot, no sinks that lead to data leakage, system compromise, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading -> preprocessing (scaling) -> clustering -> visualization and reporting; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard libraries and functions without any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads the Iris dataset, preprocesses the data using standardization, applies KMeans clustering with a fixed random seed, visualizes the clusters, and outputs the cluster centers. All operations involve standard machine learning procedures and visualization. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious library calls.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of clustering analysis on a public dataset. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard practices and libraries for data analysis and visualization.",
