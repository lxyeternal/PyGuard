  "purpose": "The code performs clustering analysis on the Iris dataset, including data loading, preprocessing, clustering, visualization, and reporting cluster centers.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from sklearn.datasets.load_iris() and standardizes features using StandardScaler.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs cluster centers via print and visualizes data with matplotlib; no untrusted data sinks or external transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading to preprocessing, then to clustering, visualization, and reporting; no external or untrusted data flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and procedures for data analysis, with no network activity, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. It loads a public dataset, applies standard preprocessing, performs clustering, visualizes results, and prints cluster centers. All steps are typical, well-understood, and pose no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No evidence of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation is present, and the code is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data analysis script with no malicious or security-risk elements. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
