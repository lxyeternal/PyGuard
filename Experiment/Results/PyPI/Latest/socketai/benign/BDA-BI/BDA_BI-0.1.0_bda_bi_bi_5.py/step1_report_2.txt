  "purpose": "Perform unsupervised clustering analysis on the Iris dataset using K-Means and visualize the results.",
  "sources": "Loading dataset with sklearn.datasets.load_iris(), reading feature data into variable X, reading cluster labels from kmeans.labels_",
  "sinks": "Printing cluster centers with print(), displaying plots with plt.show()",
  "flows": "Data loading and standardization from sklearn dataset to clustering, then to visualization and output",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The script loads a well-known dataset, applies standard preprocessing, performs clustering, and visualizes results. No suspicious data flow, no network activity, no credential handling, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of standard libraries and common data analysis steps indicates typical usage for data science tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate data analysis on the Iris dataset with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It utilizes standard libraries and functions appropriately. No security risks are identified.",
