      "conclusion": "Most reports are accurate and consistent with their assessments. The primary concern is Report 4, where eval()/exec() functions warrant a higher malware score (~0.4) due to their potential for malicious exploitation. Other reports are appropriately scored given their content. Overall, the security posture should reflect the presence of dynamic execution functions with a slightly elevated malware and risk score, while benign code remains at zero."

The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the slight security risk score reflects minimal inherent risk in static database scripts. No modifications are necessary."
