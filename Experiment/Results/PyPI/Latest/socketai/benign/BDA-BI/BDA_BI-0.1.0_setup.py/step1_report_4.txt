{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'BDA_BI' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata (name, version, author info, description, URL, classifiers, dependencies).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted input or execute code based on external data.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code does not include runtime data flows or input/output processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the setup script follows standard practices with no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script employing setuptools to configure package metadata. It uses static data without any dynamic or unsafe operations. No external input handling, no code injection points, and no malicious behaviors observed. The structure and content are typical for a setup.py file. No signs of obfuscation or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is a standard, benign configuration for packaging a Python project. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
