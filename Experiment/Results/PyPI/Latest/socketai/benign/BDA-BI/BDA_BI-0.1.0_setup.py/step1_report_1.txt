{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'BDA_BI' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, author info, description, URL, dependencies, classifiers, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "There are no identifiable sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "N/A – The code simply assigns static strings and lists to setup parameters without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is standard setup configuration with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools to define package metadata and configuration. It uses static values for package information and an empty list for dependencies. The structure is typical for Python package setup scripts, with no dynamic code execution, user input processing, or external data fetching. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks present in this code.",
