  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'BDA_BI'.",
  "sources": "Input from setup() parameters and imported modules, especially 'find_packages()'.",
  "targets": "No specific sink for untrusted data; standard setup process.",
  "flows": "N/A, as no untrusted input is processed or executed in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to facilitate packaging, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It uses 'find_packages()' to automatically discover packages. There are no dynamic executions, no external data inputs, and no suspicious or malicious code constructs. The code is straightforward and follows typical packaging conventions. No security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project without any malicious intent or security risks.",
