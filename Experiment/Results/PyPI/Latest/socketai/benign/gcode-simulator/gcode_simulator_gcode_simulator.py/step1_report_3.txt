{
  "purpose": "The code simulates the execution of G-code for CNC machines, estimating total operation time and spatial bounds.",
  "sources": "Input lines parsed from G-code string, especially via regular expressions extracting coordinates, feed rates, and dwell times.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include the use of eval-like parsing, but actual code does not evaluate external code; no data leaks or unsafe executions detected.",
  "flows": "Input lines -> parsing functions -> motion calculations and trace updates -> time and bounds estimation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Regular expressions and mathematical operations are standard. Trace logging is optional and used for debugging, not malicious. No network activity or system manipulation present.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically parses G-code commands, computes motion timings, and updates spatial bounds, using standard mathematical formulas for acceleration, velocity, and motion. No obfuscated language features or suspicious data handling are present. Trace functionality is for debugging, not malicious activity. No external data or network interactions are involved. The code appears focused solely on simulation and timing estimation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate G-code simulator with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs mathematical and parsing operations typical for CNC simulation. No malicious signals or harmful patterns are detected.",
