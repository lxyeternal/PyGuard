{
  "purpose": "The code simulates CNC G-code motion timing, parsing coordinates, feed rates, and dwell times, and calculates motion durations and bounds for CNC operations.",
  "sources": "Regex-based parsing of 'X', 'Y', 'F', 'P', 'S' parameters in G-code lines, reading motion commands, dwell commands, and boundary updates.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external data sinks or network activity; optional trace logs for debugging.",
  "flows": "From regex parsing of input lines to motion calculations, boundary updates, and optional trace node updates; no external data flow or system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code patterns; trace feature for debugging, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs physics-based motion timing calculations, regex parsing for G-code parameters, boundary tracking, and optional debugging traces. It uses standard mathematical formulas for acceleration, deceleration, and junction speed, with no external system calls or data exfiltration. The structure is clear, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The parsing and calculations are consistent with a CNC motion simulator, and the trace feature is for debugging purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CNC motion simulation utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs physics-based timing calculations and boundary tracking, with optional debugging traces. All signals indicate benign behavior, and the security risk is very low.",
