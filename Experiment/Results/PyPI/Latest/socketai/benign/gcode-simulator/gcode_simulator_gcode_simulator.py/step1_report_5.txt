{
  "purpose": "The code simulates and estimates the execution time of G-code commands for CNC machines, including motion calculations and bounds tracking.",
  "sources": "Line input parsing (e.g., regex matches for X, Y, F, P, S), input G-code string, motion command detection functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks of untrusted data affecting system security; mainly performs calculations and state updates internally.",
  "flows": "Input G-code lines -> parsing functions -> motion calculations and trace updates -> time and bounds estimation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code performs standard motion simulation calculations with no obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly parses G-code commands, manages CNC motion simulation, and tracks bounds and timing. No external network calls, file manipulations, or sensitive data handling are present. Functions are well-structured for physics-based motion calculations, with proper safety checks. Trace logging is optional for debugging. The use of regex and math functions appears straightforward and appropriate for the purpose. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident, and the code does not perform any unintended actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CNC motion simulator without malicious intent. It only performs internal calculations related to motion planning and timing, with no signs of sabotage or malware. No security risks or malicious behaviors are detected.",
