{
  "purpose": "This code simulates the execution time of G-code commands for CNC machines, estimating total motion time and bounds based on machine settings.",
  "sources": "Data is read from G-code command strings via regex searches for X, Y, F, P, S parameters; input lines are parsed from provided G-code strings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks found that process untrusted data in a way that affects system security; no data leaks or external system interactions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input lines are parsed for coordinate and command data; motion commands influence timing and bounds updates; no external data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code performs standard parsing and simulation operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs parsing of G-code commands, calculating motion times, junction speeds, and bounds without executing external or unsafe operations. It uses regex for parameter extraction, normalizes vectors, computes motion timing respecting acceleration and velocity limits, and optionally traces motion paths. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is detected. The structure and logic align with a typical CNC motion simulator, with proper separation of concerns and no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CNC G-code simulator with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely within the scope of motion timing and bounds estimation, with no external or unsafe operations.",
