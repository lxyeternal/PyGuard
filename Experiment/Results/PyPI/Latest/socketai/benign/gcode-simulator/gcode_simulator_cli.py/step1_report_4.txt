{
  "purpose": "The script is a command-line tool for simulating and visualizing G-code toolpaths, estimating execution time, and outputting results in JSON or human-readable format.",
  "sources": "Reads G-code file specified by 'gcode_file' argument.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via click.echo; no untrusted data sinks or network transmission present.",
  "flows": "Reads G-code from file → processes with GCodeSimulator → outputs results (JSON or text).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No evidence of malicious code or obfuscation; use of standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries, including 'click' for CLI, 'datetime', 'json', 'sys', and local modules for simulation and plotting. It reads a user-specified G-code file, processes it through a simulator object, and outputs estimated execution time and bounds. The code handles exceptions during file reading properly. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The structure and flow are straightforward, focused on simulation and visualization. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI tool for G-code simulation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or data leakage channels.",
