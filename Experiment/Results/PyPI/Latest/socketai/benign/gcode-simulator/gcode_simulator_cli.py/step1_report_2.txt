  "purpose": "This script serves as a command-line interface for analyzing G-code files, estimating execution time, bounds, and optionally visualizing the toolpath and outputting results in JSON format.",
  "sources": "Reads G-code file specified by 'gcode_file' argument from disk.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via click.echo to stdout, which is generally safe; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads G-code file (source), processes it through GCodeSimulator (potentially complex processing), outputs results via echo (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; usage of standard libraries and imported modules is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as a CLI wrapper around the GCodeSimulator for G-code analysis. It reads input data, processes it with the simulator, and outputs the results. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are present. All functions and modules seem standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool for G-code analysis with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious actions, and all data handling appears safe. Therefore, the overall security risk is negligible.",
