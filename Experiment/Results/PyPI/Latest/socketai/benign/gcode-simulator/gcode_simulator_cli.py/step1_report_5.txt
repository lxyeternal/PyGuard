  "purpose": "The script is a command-line tool for simulating and visualizing G-code toolpaths with configurable GRBL settings and output options.",
  "sources": "File input ('gcode_file') read in 'with open' statement.",
  "sinks": "Output to console via 'click.echo' and 'sys.exit'; JSON output via 'json.dumps'; plotting with 'plot_trace'.",
  "flows": "Source: File read → Simulator processes G-code → Results formatted and output → Visualization plotted if enabled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activities, no backdoors or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a G-code file specified by the user, processes it with a GCodeSimulator instance, estimates execution time and bounds, and outputs the results either as formatted text or JSON. It also provides visualization if requested. Usage of standard libraries and well-known third-party modules like 'click' and 'json' appears benign. No external network activity, no embedded or dynamic code execution, and no data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical CLI tool for G-code simulation with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. It relies on external, presumably trusted, modules for simulation and plotting. No suspicious activities or malware patterns are present.",
