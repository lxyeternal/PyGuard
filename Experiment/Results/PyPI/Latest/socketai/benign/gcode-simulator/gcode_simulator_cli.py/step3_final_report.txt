  "purpose": "A CLI utility for estimating execution time, bounds, and visualizing G-code toolpaths based on user-defined settings.",
  "sources": "Reads G-code file from disk; user inputs via command-line options.",
  "sinks": "Outputs results to stdout; optionally visualizes data via plot_trace.",
  "flows": "Reads G-code file -> processes with GCodeSimulator -> outputs estimation results -> optionally visualizes trace.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file reading with exception handling, uses local modules for simulation and visualization, and outputs data securely. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or malicious patterns are present. The code structure is clear, and all external inputs are handled safely. Visualization is local and non-intrusive.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured CLI tool for G-code analysis with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
