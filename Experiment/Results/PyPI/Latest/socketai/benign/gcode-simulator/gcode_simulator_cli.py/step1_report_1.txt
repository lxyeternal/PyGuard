{
  "purpose": "The script is a command-line tool for simulating and visualizing G-code execution with configurable machine settings.",
  "sources": "Reads G-code file from the filesystem specified by the user",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON data or textual summaries to stdout, no untrusted data sinks found that lead to system compromise",
  "flows": "Reads G-code from file -> processes with GCodeSimulator -> outputs results in JSON or text; visualization is generated if enabled",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of external libraries appears standard and appropriate for the purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and imported modules to process G-code files. It reads input files securely, with exception handling, and outputs data in a controlled format. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors are present. The code primarily performs file I/O, data processing, and visualization, which are typical for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate G-code simulation utility without malicious intent. No signs of malware, malicious backdoors, or security risks are detected. It operates in a typical manner for command-line processing and visualization tasks.",
