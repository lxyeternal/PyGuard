  "purpose": "This script is a command-line tool for simulating and visualizing G-code toolpaths, estimating execution time, and outputting results in JSON or human-readable format.",
  "sources": "Reads G-code input from a file specified by the user.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON results or textual estimates to stdout; does not write to external systems or execute external commands based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads G-code from file -> processes with GCodeSimulator -> outputs results; no untrusted data flows into system commands or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns; imports and function usage are standard for CLI tools. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility using 'click' for argument parsing. It reads G-code from a file, estimates execution time using a simulator, and optionally visualizes or outputs JSON. No network access, no execution of untrusted code, and no suspicious data handling are present. All data flows are limited to file reading and stdout output. The imported modules are standard or local, and the code structure is typical for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It functions as a G-code simulation tool without any suspicious or harmful actions. The code appears safe and well-structured.",
