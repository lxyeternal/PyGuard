{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to visualize a trace of movements (likely from a 3D printer or CNC machine) by plotting nodes with feed rates and interpolating between nodes for smoothness.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'trace_nodes' list of TraceNode objects, which contain x, y, feed, and time attributes. It also accesses 'bounds' for plotting limits.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input beyond plotting data; no external data sinks, network communication, or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'trace_nodes' through interpolation into plotting functions. No untrusted data flows into sensitive system operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code uses standard libraries (math, numpy, matplotlib) and straightforward interpolation logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles visualization of trace data. It interpolates points for smoother rendering and plots the trace with color coding for feed rate. The interpolation is standard linear, and plotting uses safe, well-known libraries. There are no indications of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors. No network or file system access occurs, and no obfuscated or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data visualization module for trace data with interpolation. It does not contain malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and purposefully designed for plotting movement traces.",
