{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to visualize a trace path composed of TraceNode objects, plotting their positions and feed rates with interpolated points for smoothness and clarity.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the list of TraceNode objects passed to plot_trace and interpolate_trace_nodes functions; specifically, node.x, node.y, node.feed, node.time properties. The bounds parameter provides the spatial limits.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or cause side effects are present. The code primarily generates visual plots using matplotlib, which does not typically process untrusted data in a security-sensitive manner.",
  "flows": "TraceNodes are interpolated to create a smooth path; data flows from the input list through interpolation, then into plotting functions where coordinate and feed rate data are visualized. No untrusted external data influences the process beyond provided trace nodes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries and functions for visualization and math operations. All data handling appears to be internal, with no external data access or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code reads trace node data including coordinates, feed rate, and timestamps to interpolate additional nodes for smooth plotting. It then uses matplotlib to generate a detailed grid and a colored line representing the trace, with feed rate mapped to color. No obfuscated code, external data access, or suspicious behavior is observed. The functions perform standard calculations, interpolation, and plotting without any malicious intent or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward visualization utility for trace data, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes internal data and produces a visual output without external communication or sensitive data handling beyond basic plotting. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
