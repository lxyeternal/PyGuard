  "purpose": "Visualize a CNC or 3D printing trace path with interpolated points, color-coded by feed rate.",
  "sources": "TraceNode objects providing x, y, feed, and time data",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib plotting functions; no external data or system interactions",
  "flows": "TraceNode data flows into interpolation, then into plotting with color mapping",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries",
  "analysis": "The code performs linear interpolation between trace nodes based on distance, then visualizes the path with color indicating feed rate. It relies solely on standard libraries and internal data structures, with no external system calls, network activity, or file I/O. The logic is clear, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The interpolation and plotting are typical for visualization utilities, and no obfuscation or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured visualization utility for trace data. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
