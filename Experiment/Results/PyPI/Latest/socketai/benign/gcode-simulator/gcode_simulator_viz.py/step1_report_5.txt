{
  "purpose": "The code visualizes a trace of 3D printer or CNC machine movements, interpolating nodes and plotting them with color-coded feed rates.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the trace_nodes parameter, which is a list of TraceNode objects containing position (x, y), feed rate, and time data.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib for plotting; no direct data sinks that pose security threats. No network transmission, file writing, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Input trace_nodes → interpolate_trace_nodes() → processed nodes → plot_trace() constructs plot with interpolated data and visualizes it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code performs standard data interpolation and plotting functions. No suspicious network activity, file operations, or malicious system calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles data visualization for trace nodes, including interpolation of points to smooth the path and plotting with color mapping based on feed rate. It performs calculations for grid lines and aspect ratio, utilizing numpy and matplotlib, with no external or hidden data transmission or execution. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The functions rely on standard mathematical and plotting operations. All data handling appears intended for visualization purposes without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard visualization module for trace data, involving interpolation and plotting routines. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or malware. It is safe and does not pose security concerns.",
