{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to visualize trace nodes of a G-code simulation, plotting paths with color mapping based on feed rates and interpolating trace points for smoother visualization.",
  "sources": "TraceNode objects providing x, y, feed, and time attributes; bounds object providing min and max x/y values; parameters for interpolation and plotting functions.",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib plotting functions that generate visual output; no evident sinks for untrusted data beyond visualization.",
  "flows": "Input trace_nodes flow into interpolation function; interpolated nodes flow into plotting functions; data used for visualization only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of untrusted external inputs, no network connections, no data exfiltration mechanisms. The code relies on standard libraries and local data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data interpolation and visualization tasks. It reads trace node data, interpolates additional points if gaps are too large, and plots the path with color coding based on feed rate. The plotting is purely for visualization; no malicious behavior or data leaks are present. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or external network activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign visualization tool for G-code simulation trace nodes. It does not contain malware, malicious data leaks, or sabotage mechanisms. Its security risk is negligible.",
