  "purpose": "This code reads G-code input from stdin, estimates execution time and bounds using GCodeSimulator, and visualizes the trace.",
  "sources": "Reading G-code from sys.stdin",
  "sinks": "Estimate_time method potentially processes untrusted G-code; plotting functions visualize data",
  "flows": "Input G-code -> estimate_time -> print bounds and time -> plot_trace",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, initializes settings, reads G-code from stdin, estimates execution time and bounds, and plots the trace. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The modules used are external and their internal security cannot be assessed here, but their usage appears typical. The code does not handle secrets, network connections, or data leaks. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities based on the provided snippet. The empty reports do not indicate any issues. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal.",
