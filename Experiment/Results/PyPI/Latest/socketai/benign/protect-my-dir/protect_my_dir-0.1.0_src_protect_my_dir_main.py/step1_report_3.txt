{
  "purpose": "To provide a command-line tool for encrypting and decrypting files within a directory using AES encryption with password-based key derivation.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line options and prompt for password; reading files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Reading file contents; writing encrypted or decrypted files; deleting original files after processing.",
  "flows": "User inputs password -> encrypt/decrypt functions read files -> derive key -> process data with cryptography library -> overwrite or delete original files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code appears to implement standard file encryption logic. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present. Use of secrets.token_bytes for salt and IV is appropriate. Error handling is basic but expected.",
  "analysis": "The script provides file encryption and decryption functionalities utilizing cryptography primitives correctly. It handles file reading/writing securely and employs PBKDF2 with SHA256, a standard approach. No suspicious data flows, such as network communication or data exfiltration, are present. The code relies on user input for passwords, with no hardcoded secrets or insecure environment variables. Error handling during decryption is minimal but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall structure is straightforward and aligns with common encryption utilities, with no signs of malicious payloads or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard directory encryption tool using cryptography primitives properly. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. It appears to be a legitimate utility for protecting files with a password, with no security risks evident within this code fragment.",
