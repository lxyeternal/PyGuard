{
  "purpose": "Provide command-line functionality to encrypt and decrypt files within a directory using AES encryption with password-based key derivation.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from files for encryption/decryption, user input for password via click.prompt.",
  "sinks": "Writing encrypted/decrypted data back to files, removing original files, echoing messages to the console.",
  "flows": "User inputs password -> File data read -> Data encrypted/decrypted -> Output written to new files or original files deleted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or misleading variables. Use of secure cryptographic practices; no suspicious network activity, backdoors, or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic practices, using PBKDF2 with SHA256, AES CBC mode, PKCS7 padding, and secrets for IV and salt. File operations are straightforward, and the process of encrypting/decrypting files is clear and standard. No data leaks, network activity, or suspicious logic observed. The flow of data from source to sink is well-defined and secure, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs intended encryption/decryption operations securely without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It adheres to good cryptographic practices and does not contain malicious or suspicious code segments.",
