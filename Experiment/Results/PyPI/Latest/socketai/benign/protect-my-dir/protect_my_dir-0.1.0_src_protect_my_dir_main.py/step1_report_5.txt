{
  "purpose": "Provide a CLI tool to encrypt and decrypt files within a directory using AES encryption with password-based key derivation.",
  "sources": "User input for password via click.prompt; directory path input via click options.",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations during encryption/decryption; removal of original files; output messages via click.echo.",
  "flows": "User inputs password -> encrypt/decrypt functions process files -> files are read, encrypted/decrypted -> original files are deleted post-processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of secrets.token_bytes for IV and salt generation is appropriate; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors found; no obfuscated code detected; no external network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements directory encryption/decryption with proper cryptographic practices, including key derivation with PBKDF2, use of AES CBC mode with random IVs, and PKCS7 padding. The password is prompted securely without hardcoding or leakage. All file handling involves read/write operations with no apparent data leaks or malicious modifications. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. Exception handling is minimal but does not introduce malicious behavior; it only reports errors during decryption. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. Overall, the code performs intended encryption/decryption tasks securely without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of directory encryption/decryption with proper cryptographic practices and no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
