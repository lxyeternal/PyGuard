  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform data processing and possibly interact with external systems, but no explicit malicious intent is evident.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, environment variables, or standard input, depending on the context provided.",
  "sinks": "Data may be output via network requests, file writes, or console logs; specific sinks depend on the functions used.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input flows through various functions and may reach output points such as network calls or file operations, but no clear malicious data flow is identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments are detected. The code structure appears standard, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code has a typical structure for data handling and processing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are observed. Usage of third-party libraries is standard. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present. The data flow from input to output does not suggest malicious intent. The code does not perform any harmful actions such as network connections to suspicious domains, system modifications, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the detailed review, the code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard application logic with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
