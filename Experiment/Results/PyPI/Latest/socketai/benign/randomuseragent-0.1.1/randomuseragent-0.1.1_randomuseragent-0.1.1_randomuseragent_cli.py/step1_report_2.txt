{
  "purpose": "Placeholder for command-line interface function, no active implementation provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or data; it primarily contains a stub function and a conditional check for script execution.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling points in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as the function is empty and no data is processed or passed.",
  "anomalies": "The 'cli' function is empty, and there are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty CLI function and calls it within a try-except block that catches KeyboardInterrupts, logging a debug message upon interruption. No data processing, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be a minimal scaffold or template without actual functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic skeleton with no active logic, data handling, or malicious behavior. It poses no security risks or malware concerns based on the provided snippet.",
