  "purpose": "Placeholder CLI function with no implemented logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's execution context and the KeyboardInterrupt exception.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the CLI function is empty and no data is processed.",
  "anomalies": "The cli() function is defined but contains no logic; exception handling only logs a debug message without performing any action.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty CLI function and calls it within a try-except block that captures KeyboardInterrupts, logging a debug message if interrupted. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing steps. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The structure appears to be a minimal placeholder or scaffold for future implementation, with no harmful intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a placeholder for a command-line interface. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
