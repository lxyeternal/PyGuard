{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal placeholder or scaffold for a command-line interface, with no active logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; the only source is the implicit invocation of the cli() function, which is empty.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply calls an empty function and handles KeyboardInterrupt without further data movement.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an empty function and a try-except block, but these are standard placeholders with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward placeholder with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. It does not process data, connect to networks, or perform any actions that could be malicious. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions mean it poses no security threat or supply chain risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal scaffold with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The provided reports are accurate and consistent, and the scores reflect the code's harmless nature. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
