{
  "purpose": "The code defines a placeholder function for a command-line interface and handles KeyboardInterrupt exceptions during execution.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data or untrusted input is processed or transmitted; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up a structure with minimal logic.",
  "anomalies": "The cli() function is a no-op, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a stub function 'cli' with no implementation. The main block attempts to execute this function and catches KeyboardInterrupt to log a message. There are no sources, sinks, or flows involving untrusted data. The minimal structure does not demonstrate malicious intent or security issues. The lack of actual implementation means no malicious behavior can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks, and the structure is standard for a command-line application stub.",
