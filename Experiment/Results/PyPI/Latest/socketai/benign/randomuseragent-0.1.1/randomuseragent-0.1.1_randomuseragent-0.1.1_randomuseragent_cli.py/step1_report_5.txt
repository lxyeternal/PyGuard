  "purpose": "Placeholder function for command-line interface (CLI) entry point",
  "sources": "None; no data input or external data read",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flow; the function does nothing and is not called with arguments",
  "anomalies": "Empty cli() function, no implementation or malicious code present; minimal structure",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty CLI function and calls it within a try-except block to catch KeyboardInterrupt, logging a debug message if interrupted. There are no data sources, sinks, or suspicious code patterns. The structure is minimal and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code. The exception handling is simple and does not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a stub for a CLI program with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any operations, data processing, or external interactions.",
