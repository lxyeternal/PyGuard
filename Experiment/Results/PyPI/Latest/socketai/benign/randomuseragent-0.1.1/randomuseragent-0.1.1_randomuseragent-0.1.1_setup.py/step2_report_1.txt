  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code primarily redefines setup commands to raise exceptions or print messages, interrupting normal installation or development workflows.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or code obfuscation is present.\n- The custom commands seem intended to prevent or mislead installation, not to perform malicious actions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or payloads are evident.\n- The \"malware\" scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.2), which seems appropriate given the disruptive nature but lack of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code does **not** contain malware, malicious code, or obfuscated logic.\n- The custom commands intentionally raise exceptions or print messages, which could hinder installation but are not malicious.\n- No data flows or sinks indicate malicious intent.\n- The code appears to be a safeguard or anti-tampering measure, not an exploit.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The disruptive behavior (raising exceptions during install) could be considered a security risk if it prevents legitimate setup, but it doesn't directly threaten system security or data integrity.\n- The exception messages are misleading, which could cause confusion, but again, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Recommendations:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0         | 0            | 0.2          | Disruptive but not malicious; low security risk. |\n| 2       | 0         | 0            | 0.2          | Same reasoning. |\n| 3       | 0         | 0            | 0.2          | Same reasoning. |\n| 4       | 0         | 0            | 0.2          | Same reasoning. |\n| 5       | 0         | 0            | 0.2          | Same reasoning. |\n\n*The \"securityRisk\" score of 0.2 seems appropriate, reflecting that while the code interferes with installation, it does not pose a direct security threat.*\n\n### Malware Score Justification:\n- All reports have malware scores of 0, which is correct given the absence of malicious activity.\n\n### Obfuscated Score Justification:\n- All reports have obfuscated scores of 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 for all reports, reflecting installation interference but no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| **Score Type** | **Estimated Score per Report** | **Justification** |\n|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                            | No malicious code or payloads. |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                            | Code is clear and straightforward. |\n| Risk           | 0.2                          | Disruptive behavior could hinder legitimate use but does not threaten security. |\n\n**Note:** If the intent of the code is to prevent installation or mislead users, it's more of a security nuisance than a threat. The current scores align well with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports' current scores are reasonable; no adjustments are necessary.",
