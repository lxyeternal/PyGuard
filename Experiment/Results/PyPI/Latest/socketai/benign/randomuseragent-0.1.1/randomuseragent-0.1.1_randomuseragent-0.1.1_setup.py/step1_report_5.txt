{
  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for the 'randomuseragent' Python package, including custom post-installation commands.",
  "sources": "Imports from distutils.core, setuptools.command, and subprocess.check_call; code execution in run methods of custom commands.",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; no data output or network connections; exceptions are raised intentionally.",
  "flows": "Imports -> class definitions -> setup() invocation; no data flow leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Custom run methods in post-install commands raise exceptions with misleading messages; no actual malicious activity, but intentionally disruptive behavior. No actual malicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded credentials present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python package with custom command classes that override run methods to raise exceptions with misleading messages, possibly causing confusion or disruption during installation. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious operations are present. The package appears to be configured for a benign purpose, although the exception messages could hinder installation. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks were detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks; it merely disrupts the installation process with misleading exceptions. No malware or security threats are evident.",
