{
  "purpose": "The code loads specific text files ('ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt') from the package directory into variables for internal use.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt' from the package directory using open() with utf-8 encoding.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; files are read locally without external transmission or execution.",
  "flows": "Source: open() reads files; sink: variables 'ass1' and 'ass2' contain file contents, but no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code determines its directory via __file__, then reads two text files into variables. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network communication, or handle untrusted input. The logic is simple and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward resource loader with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify its safety and assign appropriate scores. No further action or concern is warranted based on the provided code.",
