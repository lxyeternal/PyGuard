{
  "purpose": "The code loads specific text files from the package directory and exposes their contents as variables.",
  "sources": "Reading files from the package directory using the open() function with a filename parameter.",
  "sinks": "Returning file contents as variables; no untrusted data output or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "File paths derived from the package directory and filenames; data flows from file reads to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the package directory via __file__, then defines a helper function to load text files from this directory. It reads two specific files ('ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt') and assigns their contents to variables. The logic is simple and does not include dynamic code execution, network communication, or sensitive data handling. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard file-loading utility with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It solely reads text files within the package directory for internal use.",
