  "purpose": "Load and expose the contents of text files within the package directory.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt' from the package directory based on the script's location.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is sent over network, written to system, or used in insecure commands.",
  "flows": "File paths are constructed from the package directory; contents are read directly into variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. Usage of file reading is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the directory of the current script and reads specific text files ('ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt') from that directory. It uses a helper function for file loading, ensuring proper encoding. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious network activity, or obfuscation. The code performs a straightforward task without any suspicious logic or hidden actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple file loader that reads and exposes text file contents from its directory. No malicious or maliciously suspicious behavior is present. It appears safe and legitimate.",
