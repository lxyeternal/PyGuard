  "purpose": "The code loads and exposes text file contents as variables within a package.",
  "sources": "Reading files from the package directory using open() and os.path.join().",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent over network, written to external files, or used in insecure commands.",
  "flows": "Input files are read into variables; no untrusted data flow to external systems or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script determines its directory, then reads specific text files ('ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt') into variables. The code uses standard file I/O with proper encoding, no external inputs or network operations are involved, and no suspicious or malicious operations are evident. There are no signs of backdoors, credential handling, or malicious payloads. Overall, the code appears to serve a simple purpose of loading local text resources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply loads text files into variables for later use.",
