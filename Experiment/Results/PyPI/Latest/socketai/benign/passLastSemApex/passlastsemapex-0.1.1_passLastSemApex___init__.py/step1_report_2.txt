{
  "purpose": "Load text files from the package directory and expose their contents as variables.",
  "sources": "The code reads files 'ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt' from the package directory using open() with a filename derived from the package's file path.",
  "sinks": "The loaded text data is stored in variables; no data is transmitted externally or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "The filename inputs are combined with the package directory path, then the files are read into variables; no external data flow or command execution is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The code straightforwardly loads text files from its local directory. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper function to load text files from its own directory. It uses __file__ to determine the package directory and reads specific files into variables. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code appears to be for standard file-loading purposes without any obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign file loader with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads and exposes text files within its package.",
