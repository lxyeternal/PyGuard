  "purpose": "Load text files ('ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt') from the package directory for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Reading local files 'ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt' from the package directory using open().",
  "sinks": "File read operations that load data into variables within the code; no direct sink of untrusted external data.",
  "flows": "File paths are constructed based on the package directory and filename; data read from files assigned to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code determines its package directory via os.path.dirname(__file__). Then, it defines a helper function to load text files from this directory. It reads 'ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt' into variables. There are no inputs from external untrusted sources, nor does it perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No signs of malicious intent or malicious obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple file loader that reads static text files from the package directory. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
