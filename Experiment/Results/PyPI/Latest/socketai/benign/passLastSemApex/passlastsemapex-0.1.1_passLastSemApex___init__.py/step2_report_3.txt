  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code determines its package directory via `__file__`.\n- Defines a helper function `_load_text_file(filename)` that opens a file in read mode with UTF-8 encoding.\n- Loads two specific files, `'ass1.txt'` and `'ass2.txt'`, into variables.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present.\n- The code appears straightforward and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Reports 1-5:**\n\n**Purpose & Description:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code loads text files from its package directory and exposes their contents as variables.\n- The sources, sinks, and data flows are consistently described.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and without malicious intent.\n- They emphasize the absence of suspicious activity, obfuscation, or external communication.\n\n**Confidence & Scores:**\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity or payload)\n- Security risk: 0 (no vulnerabilities or risky behavior identified)\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code simply loads local text files; no issues or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The analysis correctly identifies the code's behavior.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the security risk is 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  Not applicable here; all scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score reflection:**  \n  Correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  Consistent across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\nGiven the code and the reports, I concur with the assessments. The code is a benign utility for loading local text files, with no malicious or suspicious features.\n\n**My own estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's straightforward, safe nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Accept the current assessments.",
