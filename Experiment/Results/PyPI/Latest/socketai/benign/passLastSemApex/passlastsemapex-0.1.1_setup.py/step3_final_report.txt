  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for distributing a library.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description content.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Static reading of local file; no dynamic or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without error handling, which could cause an exception if 'README.md' is missing, but this is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools to package a Python library. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, which is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious patterns are present. The only minor concern is the lack of error handling when opening the file, but this does not introduce security risks or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and adherence to common packaging practices indicate it is safe and free from malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores are consistent with its straightforward nature.",
