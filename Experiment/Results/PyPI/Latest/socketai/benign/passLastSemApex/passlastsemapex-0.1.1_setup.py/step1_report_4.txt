  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python library named 'passLastSemApex'.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from hardcoded strings, package data inclusion, and the README.md file.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or external data transmission points present.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content for long description; no external network or data manipulation flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected. Uses standard packaging procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and configuration. It reads the README.md file for the long description, which is standard practice. No code injection, network operations, or suspicious behavior are evident. The package author and email are explicitly specified, but these are typical in setup scripts. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical package configuration without suspicious behavior.",
