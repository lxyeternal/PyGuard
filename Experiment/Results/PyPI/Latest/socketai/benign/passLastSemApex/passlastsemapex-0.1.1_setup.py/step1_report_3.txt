  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'passLastSemApex'.",
  "sources": "Reading package data, reading 'README.md' for long description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external calls.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content during setup; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without try-except could be risky if 'README.md' is missing, but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file for packaging a Python project. It imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata. The only potentially risky operation is reading 'README.md' without error handling, which could cause an exception if the file is missing, but this is not malicious. No external network connections, no execution of untrusted input, no suspicious code structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
