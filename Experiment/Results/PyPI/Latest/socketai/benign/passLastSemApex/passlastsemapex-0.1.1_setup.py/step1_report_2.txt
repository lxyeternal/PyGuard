{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'passLastSemApex', specifying package metadata and installation options.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from 'README.md' for the long description.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points include reading 'README.md' content and email address information, but these are standard for package setup.",
  "flows": "Source is reading 'README.md' -> data used in 'long_description' field during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all code follows standard packaging procedures. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions from setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata, including reading a README file for the description. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive information handling beyond standard metadata. The email address is publicly specified, which is common in package metadata. There are no signs of malicious code or obfuscated behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a typical configuration for publishing a Python library, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
