  "purpose": "Defines a custom Timestamp class for handling datetime objects with parsing and serialization methods.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a dictionary input in the parse class method, specifically the 'iso' key.",
  "sinks": "Returns a dictionary with ISO formatted datetime string and Unix timestamp in to_dict method.",
  "flows": "parse method reads 'iso' key from input, converts to datetime, creates Timestamp instance; to_dict converts datetime to iso and timestamp for output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple data container with parsing and serialization. It reads ISO datetime strings from input, converts to datetime object, and outputs ISO and Unix timestamp formats. No external data sources, no network activity, and no potentially malicious operations are present. The methods use standard library functions without any suspicious behaviors. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class for timestamp handling with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
