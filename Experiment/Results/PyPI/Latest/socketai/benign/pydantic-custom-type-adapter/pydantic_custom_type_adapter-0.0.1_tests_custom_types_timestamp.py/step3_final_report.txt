  "purpose": "Utility class for handling timestamp parsing and serialization using standard datetime functions.",
  "sources": "Input dictionary with 'iso' key containing ISO format timestamp string.",
  "sinks": "Serialization output via to_dict method; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows.",
  "flows": "Input dict -> parse() method -> internal datetime object -> to_dict() serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Timestamp class that encapsulates a datetime object, with methods for parsing from a dictionary and serializing back. It relies solely on standard library functions (fromisoformat, isoformat, timestamp), with straightforward data flow. No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is simple, well-structured, and free of suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for timestamp handling with no malicious or security risks. All reports correctly identify its straightforward nature and assign scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The overall assessment is that the code poses no threat, and the scores are consistent with its benign behavior.",
