  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured testing suite for data models with custom types. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk due to custom adapters but no actual threat."
