  "purpose": "Validation and testing of custom data types using Pydantic adapters, including serialization, deserialization, and validation error handling.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries passed to model_validate methods, internal test data.",
  "sinks": "model_dump outputs, validation error exceptions, assertions.",
  "flows": "Input data -> validation/parsing via adapters -> model instantiation -> serialization or error handling.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Pydantic validation with custom adapters for types like Email, UserId, Point, and SafeString. It performs straightforward validation, serialization, and error testing. No network, file, or system commands are present. Lambdas used in dump functions are simple data transformations. Validation errors are expected and handled appropriately. No obfuscation or malicious code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical validation and testing suite for custom types in a Python project, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified and accurate.",
