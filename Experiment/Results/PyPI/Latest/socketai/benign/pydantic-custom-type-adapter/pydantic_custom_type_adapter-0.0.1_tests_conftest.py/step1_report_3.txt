  "purpose": "Provide fixtures for current UTC time and UUID generation for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "datetime.datetime.now() and uuid.uuid4() functions",
  "sinks": "None; the code only generates data, does not process untrusted input",
  "flows": "Not applicable; data is generated locally and returned, no external data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior detected; standard testing fixture setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for date/time and UUIDs, then defines two pytest fixtures: one returns the current UTC time, and the other generates a new UUID. Both functions are straightforward, do not process external inputs or data, and are typical for testing setups. No malicious or suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest fixture setup used for testing, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
