  "purpose": "Define pytest fixtures to generate current UTC datetime and UUID for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Standard library functions: datetime.datetime.now() with timezone UTC, uuid.uuid4()",
  "sinks": "None; no data is transmitted or stored externally",
  "flows": "Fixtures generate data independently; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, no obfuscation or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines two fixtures that generate current UTC time and UUIDs. It does not process external input, transmit data, or contain suspicious patterns. The code is typical for test setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe test fixture setup with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
