{
  "purpose": "The code defines two pytest fixtures for generating the current UTC datetime and a UUID for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or transmit data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard library functions and a common testing framework without any suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules (datetime, uuid) and pytest, defining fixtures for current UTC time and UUIDs. These fixtures are typical for testing and do not perform any malicious activity. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and the code does not execute untrusted data or contain obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup for testing purposes using pytest fixtures. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
