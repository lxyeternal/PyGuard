  "purpose": "This code provides fixtures for testing purposes, specifically generating the current UTC time and a random UUID.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current system time and generates a UUID using built-in libraries.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or outputs that could cause data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The data flows from system calls (datetime.now and uuid.uuid4) to test fixtures that supply these values for tests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard library functions without unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for date/time and UUID generation, then defines pytest fixtures returning the current UTC datetime and a newly generated UUID. The usage is straightforward and typical for testing environments. There are no hardcoded secrets, no untrusted input handling, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to be standard testing setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as test fixtures for datetime and UUID. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
