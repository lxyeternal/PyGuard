{
  "purpose": "Provides a Pydantic adapter class to facilitate custom type serialization and deserialization in Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Imports from importlib.metadata, pydantic_core, and typing; usage of metadata.version to retrieve package version.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data processing or external communications.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code defines a class and imports modules; no data flows from sources to sinks that involve untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, unusual behaviors, or hidden functionalities observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic adapter class for Pydantic, enabling custom serialization/deserialization of user-defined types. It imports necessary modules safely, retrieves version info, and structures the adapter class with clear docstrings and type hints. The core schema uses standard pydantic_core components without any suspicious or malicious constructs. No external network access, no data leakage, or system manipulation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Pydantic adapter class for custom types. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose in schema customization.",
