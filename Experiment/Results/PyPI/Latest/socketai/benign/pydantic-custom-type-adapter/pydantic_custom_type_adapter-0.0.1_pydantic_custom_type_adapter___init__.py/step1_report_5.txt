{
  "purpose": "The code defines a generic adapter class for integrating custom types with Pydantic models by providing serialization and deserialization functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version from metadata and accepts user-defined functions 'parse' and 'dump' for custom type handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are explicitly present; no data leaks or external communications are evident.",
  "flows": "The schema creation method uses the parse and dump functions to handle data validation and serialization within the Pydantic core schema.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports version info and defines a generic adapter class for Pydantic, focusing on schema validation and serialization. The class uses user-provided functions for parsing and dumping data. The code appears standard and well-documented. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or external network activity. It strictly implements type adaptation for serialization purposes, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for Pydantic custom type handling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It operates purely as a schema adapter without external interactions or sensitive data handling.",
