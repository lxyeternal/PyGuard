{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Pydantic adapter class to serialize and deserialize custom types within Pydantic models, enabling custom data handling.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata for version info; no other input sources; user-defined functions parse and dump provided during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that send data externally; no untrusted data flows to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "The class converts data via user-defined parse and dump functions within schema validation but does not perform any network or system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code relies entirely on user-provided functions for parsing and dumping, which could be malicious if those functions are malicious, but the code itself does not include such functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic adapter class for Pydantic models to handle custom types through user-provided parse and dump functions. It uses standard Python and Pydantic core schema features without any obfuscated or suspicious code. No external data transmission, credential handling, or system modifications are present. The functions are supplied externally, so malicious behavior could originate from user-supplied functions, but this cannot be determined from this code alone. The code structure is straightforward, well-documented, and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe and serves as a schema adapter for custom types in Pydantic. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks itself. Its security depends entirely on the safety of the user-provided parse and dump functions, but these are external inputs not included in this code.",
