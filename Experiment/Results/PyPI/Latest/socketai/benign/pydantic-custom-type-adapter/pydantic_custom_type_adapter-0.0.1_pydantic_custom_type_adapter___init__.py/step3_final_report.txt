  "purpose": "A Pydantic adapter for custom types, enabling serialization and deserialization via user-defined functions within Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Importing package version info via importlib.metadata; user-supplied parse and dump functions invoked during schema validation and serialization.",
  "sinks": "User-provided parse and dump functions; no other data sinks or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated through is_instance_schema and no_info_plain_validator_function; then serialized via plain_serializer_function_ser_schema, with user functions handling parsing and dumping.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; reliance on external functions is standard but could be exploited if functions are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic class for adapting custom types in Pydantic, using standard schema components. It imports version info and constructs schemas with no external side effects. The main risk stems from user-supplied functions, which could be malicious if untrusted, but this is inherent to the design rather than a flaw. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The malware score is appropriately zero; the security risk is low (~0.2), reflecting trust assumptions rather than code flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe utility for custom type adaptation in Pydantic. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of user-supplied functions, which is outside the code's scope. The scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
