{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom SafeString class for testing, ensuring string values are alphanumeric.",
  "sources": "Input string to the constructor (__init__) and the parse class method.",
  "targets": "No direct data leaks or untrusted sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input string → __init__ method → value attribute; parse method → __init__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The class validates that input strings are alphanumeric, raising an exception otherwise. The parse method creates an instance using this validation. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or unsafe operations. The code appears to serve a benign purpose of sanitizing string inputs, with no external communication, no code injection, and no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, safe class for handling alphanumeric strings, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
