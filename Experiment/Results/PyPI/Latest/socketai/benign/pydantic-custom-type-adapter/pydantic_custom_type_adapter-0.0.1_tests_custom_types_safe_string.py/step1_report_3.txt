{
  "purpose": "Define a custom SafeString class for testing purposes, ensuring only alphanumeric strings are accepted.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through the constructor (__init__) and the parse class method.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not perform data output, network communication, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input string flows from the parse method or constructor to the value attribute after validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs are present. The class enforces a strict alphanumeric check.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a SafeString class with validation to accept only alphanumeric strings, raising an exception otherwise. It uses standard Python features with no network or system calls, no eval/exec usage, and no external data handling. The parse method creates instances via the constructor, maintaining validation. The code appears straightforward and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple validation wrapper class for strings with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
