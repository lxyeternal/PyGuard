  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'javascan' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "User-provided package information, dependency imports, and print statements.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or sensitive data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the code primarily handles setup and dependency checking.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'distutils.core.setup' to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers, which is standard for Python package setup. It includes a simple try-except block to check if dependencies 'requests' and 'cryptography' are installed, printing a success message if so. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are observed. The script appears to be a straightforward package setup script with an auxiliary dependency check.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with a basic dependency check. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in the provided code.",
