{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'javascan' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version, author, url, dependencies) and attempts to import dependencies 'requests' and 'cryptography' after installation.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves setting up package metadata, then attempting to import dependencies, and printing a success message if import succeeds.",
  "anomalies": "The import statements are placed after the setup() call, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The print statements are simple and do not perform any suspicious actions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup using distutils, specifying dependencies. The try-except block after setup tries to import dependencies and prints confirmation messages. There is no code that reads untrusted input, manipulates data insecurely, or executes untrusted code. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any malware or suspicious activity. The only notable point is the unconventional placement of import checks after setup, but this is harmless.",
