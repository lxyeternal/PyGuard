  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The report correctly states that the code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are both 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0, matching the analysis. The confidence is high at 1.  \n- **Justification for scores:** The code is static, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The import check is harmless.  \n- **Overall:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The report notes the unconventional placement of import checks after setup, but clarifies it’s harmless.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0, which aligns with the analysis. Security risk is 0.1, which might be slightly high considering the minimal activity, but given the import check could potentially be misused in malicious contexts, it’s acceptable.  \n- **Justification for scores:** No malicious activity detected; the slight security risk score reflects the potential for misuse, but no actual malicious behavior is observed.  \n- **Overall:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The analysis confirms the code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0, security risk at 0.1, which is acceptable.  \n- **Overall:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a typical setup script with dependency checks.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0, security risk at 0.1, which is consistent.  \n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The report correctly states the code is standard and safe.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0, security risk at 0, fitting the code’s behavior.  \n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0 in some reports (0.1), justified by the potential misuse of import checks, but no actual risks are present.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the minor potential for misuse, but no actual security threat)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are reasonable given the code’s straightforward nature.",
