{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'javascan', specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters and the import statements for 'requests' and 'cryptography'.",
  "sinks": "The import attempt and print statements, which could be used to obfuscate malicious activity or trigger suspicious behavior if combined with malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code imports dependencies, then attempts to verify their installation, and finally prints a success message.",
  "anomalies": "The code's structure appears standard for a setup script; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are present. The 'try-except' block only catches import errors without any malicious activity. No obfuscated or unusual code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup configuration with metadata and dependencies. The import statements are standard. The 'try-except' block checks for dependency installation and outputs a success message, which is typical. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious logic is present. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. Overall security risk is negligible.",
