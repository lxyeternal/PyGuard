  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, with a dependency check after setup.\n- No dynamic or malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious data flows.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, with high confidence (mostly 1 or 0.9).\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate, static setup data, import, and print statements.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Same as above, notes the unusual placement of import checks after setup.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent, just unconventional placement.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — perhaps slightly high, but given the unconventional placement, a small risk score (0.1) is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Same, notes the import check is harmless.\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Similar, emphasizes no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — again, a small risk score is reasonable due to the dependency check.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Same, emphasizes standard setup.\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n- All reports are consistent, accurate, and correctly interpret the code.\n- The code contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The small risk scores (~0.1) assigned in some reports are justified due to the dependency check, but overall, the risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a risk score of **0.0** is appropriate. The small risk scores (~0.1) in some reports are slightly conservative but acceptable; however, for consistency and accuracy, I recommend lowering them to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- **Your current scores are reasonable, but for consistency and precision, I suggest:**\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects the benign, straightforward nature of the code with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The code is a standard setup script with a simple dependency check, all within normal practices.",
