  "purpose": "A standard Python package setup script that defines package metadata and dependencies, with a simple import check for dependencies.",
  "sources": "The import statement for 'requests' and 'cryptography' after the setup call.",
  "sinks": "The print statements indicating install success or failure, which do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The import check flow: attempting to import dependencies and printing the result.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional placement of import checks after setup, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with dependency verification. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present. The import check is benign and standard for verifying dependencies. The placement of the import check after setup is unconventional but harmless. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data flows are detected. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero. The obfuscation score is zero, as the code is clear and simple.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns. The current scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores are zero, and the security risk is negligible. For accuracy, the risk score can be set to 0.0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
