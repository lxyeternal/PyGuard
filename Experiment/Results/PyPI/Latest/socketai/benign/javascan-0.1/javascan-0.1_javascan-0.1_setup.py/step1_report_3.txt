{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'javascan' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input data from setup() parameters and import statements.",
  "sinks": "The import statements and the try-except block for requests and cryptography modules could potentially be used to execute code or report system information, but currently only handle import errors.",
  "flows": "Code reads package metadata and attempts to import dependencies; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The try-except block only catches import errors and prints a message; it does not execute any suspicious code or collect system data. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscation or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies. It includes a simple check to verify if dependencies were installed successfully. No malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands, are present. The dependency check does not perform any harmful actions; it merely confirms import success. The code appears straightforward and typical for package distribution, with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package configuration and dependency verification without any malicious or suspicious activity.",
