  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a straightforward setup script with a simple import check.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 seems high; given no malicious activity, a lower score (e.g., 0.1) would be more appropriate.\n- **Justification for higher scores?** None needed; the code is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The placement of import checks after setup is unconventional but harmless.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1. This seems reasonable.\n- **Justification for higher scores?** None; the code remains benign.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a standard setup script with dependency checks.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 or 0.1. The current score of 0.1 is acceptable.\n- **Justification for higher scores?** No.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is typical for package setup.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a standard setup script.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 or 0.1. The current score of 0 is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, which is reasonable given the benign nature but could be lowered further.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are generally appropriate; however, for such benign setup scripts, a risk score of **0.0** or **0.1** is more fitting.\n- The malware score should remain at **0** across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at **0**.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 (leaning towards 0.0 for such simple setup scripts)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, harmless setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns. The current scoring aligns well with this assessment.",
