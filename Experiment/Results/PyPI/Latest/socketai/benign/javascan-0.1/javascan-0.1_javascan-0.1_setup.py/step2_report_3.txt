  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues identified; the code is a straightforward setup script with harmless import checks.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are reasonable given the analysis.  \n- **Justification:** The code is static, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The import check is standard.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues; the placement of import checks after setup is unconventional but harmless.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The small risk score seems to reflect minimal concern over the unusual placement, but it's still very low.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or suspicious logic. The slight risk score could be justified due to unconventional code structure, but overall negligible.  \n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard dependency check and setup.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Slightly above zero, perhaps due to the dependency check, but no real threat.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just a simple verification step.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard setup with dependency verification.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The small risk score is consistent with the benign code.  \n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity detected.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues; similar to previous reports, standard setup code.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The negligible risk score aligns with the code's simplicity.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior is detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent.  \n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the unconventional placement of import checks after setup, but overall very low.\n\n### My own estimate (considering all reports and the code):\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk:** 0.05 (minimal, mostly due to unconventional code structure, but not risky)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores across reports are justified.",
