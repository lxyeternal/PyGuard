{
  "purpose": "Package setup script for the 'javascan' Python package, intended to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() function; import statements; exception handling block; print statements.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the only dynamic action is the import check which is safe.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The import check is standard and harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains a static setup configuration for packaging. It includes an import try-except block that outputs a message based on import success. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The import check and print statements are common and safe. Dependencies are specified for installation but are not exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate setup process with standard practices.",
