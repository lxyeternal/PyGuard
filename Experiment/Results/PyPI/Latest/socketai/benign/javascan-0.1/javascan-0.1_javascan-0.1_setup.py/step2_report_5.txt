  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify their assessments against the code.\n\n**Overall Code Summary:**\n- The code is a typical setup script for a Python package named 'javascan'.\n- It uses `distutils.core.setup` to define package metadata and dependencies.\n- After the setup, it performs a simple import check for 'requests' and 'cryptography' inside a try-except block, printing success or failure messages.\n- No dynamic data handling, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as a static setup script with harmless import checks.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The placement of import checks after setup is unconventional but harmless.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0.1`, `obfuscated: 0`.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly overestimating security risk due to placement, but overall, no malicious activity. The `securityRisk` could be set to 0 or 0.1; 0.1 is acceptable given the unconventional placement, but it's not a real risk.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0.1`.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly high on `securityRisk` given the code's simplicity. Since there's no actual security issue, it should be 0 or very close to it.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Judgment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.1), but the code is benign. I would set this to **0** for all, as no real security risk exists.\n\n### **My Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** **0** — no vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Notes:**\n- The import check after setup is unconventional but not malicious.\n- The overall code is a standard setup script with dependency verification.\n- No suspicious data flows, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is safe, with no malware or security risks.",
