{
  "purpose": "A simple Java code linter designed to enforce coding style conventions such as class, method, and variable naming standards.",
  "sources": "Reads input Java code as a string and processes it line by line for pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "Uses regex pattern matching on the code lines; does not interact with external systems, network, or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Inputs (code string) are split into lines and checked against regex patterns for class, method, and variable declarations; no data flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hidden behaviors, or obfuscation detected. The code performs straightforward pattern matching for style enforcement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 're' for regex operations. It defines a class with methods to check class declaration format, method naming, and variable naming conventions. All checks rely on pattern matching and produce errors if violations are found. The logic is simple and adheres strictly to style rules. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No external data interactions, code injections, or obfuscated code present. The code appears to be a benign style enforcement tool.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign Java style linter with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs pattern-based style checks and does not interact with external systems or handle sensitive data. The code is straightforward, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
