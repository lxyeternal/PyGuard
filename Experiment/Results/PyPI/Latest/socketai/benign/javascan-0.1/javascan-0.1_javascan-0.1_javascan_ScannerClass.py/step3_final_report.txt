  "purpose": "A static Java code style linter that checks class, method, and variable naming conventions using regex patterns.",
  "sources": "Input code string, split into lines for pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Input code -> regex pattern checks -> error logging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward regex checks for style enforcement.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple regex-based validation for Java class, method, and variable naming conventions. It reads the input code, applies pattern matching, and logs errors without external interactions, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The regex patterns are standard and serve only style enforcement. The code is transparent, safe, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis tool for Java style enforcement with no malicious or security concerns. All signals indicate safety, and the scores should reflect this.",
