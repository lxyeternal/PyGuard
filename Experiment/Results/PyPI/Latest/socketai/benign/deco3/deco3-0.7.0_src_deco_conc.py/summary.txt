  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors but relies heavily on dynamic source code retrieval and execution, which pose significant security risks if source code is untrusted. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate; the security risk score should be high (~0.7) to reflect the potential for exploitation. Proper validation and sandboxing are recommended when deploying such code."
