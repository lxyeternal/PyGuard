{
  "purpose": "AST transformer class ('SchedulerRewriter') that rewrites concurrency-related function calls, list comprehensions, and assignments to manage or transform concurrency constructs.",
  "sources": "Function calls in 'self.concurrent_funcs', function arguments, list comprehensions, assignment targets involving concurrent calls, and expression nodes.",
  "sinks": "Modified function calls (wrapping in lambdas, adding 'wait' calls), assignment expressions with 'assign' attribute, and generated wait expressions.",
  "flows": "Source nodes (concurrent function calls, arguments) are processed in 'encounter_call' and 'references_arg'; these influence subsequent AST modifications such as inserting wait calls or wrapping calls in lambdas.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'NotImplementedError' for unsupported patterns; no malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation detected; dynamic AST manipulation is standard for code rewriting tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard AST transformer designed to handle concurrency constructs by rewriting function calls, list comprehensions, and assignments. It raises errors for unsupported patterns, tracks encountered functions and arguments, and modifies AST nodes to insert wait calls and wrap calls in lambdas. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The code's purpose appears to be managing or scheduling concurrency tasks. The absence of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behaviors, combined with the straightforward AST manipulations, indicates a benign utility. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious AST transformer for concurrency management. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk scores are appropriate, reflecting the code's benign purpose and safe design.",
