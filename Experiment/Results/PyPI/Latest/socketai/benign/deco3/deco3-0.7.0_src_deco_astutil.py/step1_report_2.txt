{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility for transforming Python AST nodes related to concurrent function calls, likely for asynchronous or parallel execution management.",
  "sources": "Reads source code through the AST nodes, particularly function calls, assignments, and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies or intercepts function calls, especially concurrent calls, and transforms them into wait or assign patterns.",
  "flows": "Source: AST nodes representing function calls or assignments → Transformation methods modify or wrap these nodes → Potentially change execution flow or introduce concurrency handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Use of raise for not implemented features could be a placeholder, but not malicious. No network or system access observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class SchedulerRewriter that manipulates Python AST for concurrency management, handling 'concurrent' function calls, wait calls, and assignments. It raises errors if unsupported concurrent patterns are encountered. The code does not include any network activity, data leakage, or malicious payloads. It primarily modifies AST nodes to facilitate concurrent execution semantics. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious privacy violations are detected. It functions as a source code transformer, not executing malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a non-malicious AST transformation utility for managing concurrency in Python code. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is likely a part of a larger framework for handling asynchronous execution patterns.",
