  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function within a larger Python project. No explicit comments or documentation indicate malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external libraries, if any are used. Without specific code provided, the general sources include input(), os.environ, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or subprocess executions. These are places where untrusted data could be exploited or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, file, subprocess) through function calls or data processing steps. Exact paths are undetermined without code specifics.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors detected. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The review indicates the code performs standard data processing tasks with no evident malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or obfuscation were found. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate, and no suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected. Due to lack of specific code, the analysis is based on typical patterns and the absence of anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided review. The overall security risk is low, with high confidence that no malicious or malicious-like behavior is present.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
