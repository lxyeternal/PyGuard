{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module with some basic functions and class definitions, likely part of a larger application.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters, environment variables, and standard input (if any).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, network requests (if present), or file operations, which are not explicitly shown here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (parameters, environment variables) through functions and possibly to outputs or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are evident. The code uses typical Python constructs. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code structure is straightforward, consisting of class definitions and functions that do not perform any suspicious operations. There are no indications of data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious and no insecure code practices like SQL injection or unsafe eval are present. No anomalies such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and typical for a Python module. Confidence is high that the code is safe.",
