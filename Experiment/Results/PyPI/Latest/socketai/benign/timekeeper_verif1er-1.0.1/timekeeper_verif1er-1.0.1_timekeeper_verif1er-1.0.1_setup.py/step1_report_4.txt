  "purpose": "This script sets up the package configuration for the Python project 'timekeeper_verif1er' for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file to obtain long description; accessing package metadata variables (VERSION, DESCRIPTION, AUTHOR).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network calls, system commands, or data writes are present.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and assigns metadata variables, then passes these to setup() function without any user input or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard setup tools with no malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: importing setup functions, defining package metadata, reading a README for description, and invoking setup() with these parameters. There are no dynamic or executable parts that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. The code strictly adheres to conventional setup script practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, benign Python setup script used for packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code fragment.",
