  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'timekeeper_verif1er' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; setup configuration is standard and does not handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Using its content for 'long_description' in setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup, defines package metadata, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with standard arguments. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or malicious imports are present. The reading of 'README.md' is a normal operation for documentation purposes. The code does not perform any network operations, data collection, or other suspicious activities. It solely configures package metadata and packaging parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
