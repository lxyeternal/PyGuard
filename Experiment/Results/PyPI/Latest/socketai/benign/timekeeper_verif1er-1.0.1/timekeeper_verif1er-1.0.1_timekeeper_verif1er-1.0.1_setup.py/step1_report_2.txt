{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project 'timekeeper_verif1er' for distribution on package repositories like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file to obtain long description; reads setup parameters from hardcoded variables.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data outputs or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.md' to assign long description; uses hardcoded package metadata; calls setup() with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The script performs standard packaging tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools functions, defines package metadata including name, version, author, description, and reads the long description from a local file. It constructs setup parameters and invokes setup() to prepare the package. No external input, environment variables, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. The code follows typical packaging practices, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It simply prepares the package for distribution.",
