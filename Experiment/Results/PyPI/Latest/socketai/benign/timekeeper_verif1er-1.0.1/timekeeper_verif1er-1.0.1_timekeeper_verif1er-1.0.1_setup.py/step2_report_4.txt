  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of individual reports:**\n\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a standard Python setup script that reads a README.md file, defines package metadata, and calls `setup()` with these parameters.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or dynamic code execution are detected.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and all reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, and no anomalies or security risks are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity Checks:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description—it's a typical setup script with no deviations.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious intent, such as code injection, network calls, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; the code is straightforward.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code is static and uses standard practices.\n\n### Scoring and Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 to 0.1 is justified, given the complete absence of suspicious activity.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; all claims are based on code analysis.\n- The only potential concern could be reading a local README.md file, but this is standard practice and not risky.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard packaging script with no security issues. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe provided code is a typical, well-formed Python setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
