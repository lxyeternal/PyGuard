  "purpose": "Import the 'agent' module from the current package",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing from the local package",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified, as there is no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; import statement does not process data",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement. It does not execute any data processing, network activity, or system modification. Since it only imports a module from the same package, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this snippet. No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or anomalous code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns identified. It appears benign and standard for Python package structure.",
