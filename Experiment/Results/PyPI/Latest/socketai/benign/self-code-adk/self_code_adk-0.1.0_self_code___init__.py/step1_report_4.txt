{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'agent' from the same package, likely for use within the package's functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'agent' module from the current package context.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations with external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable; the code only performs an import statement with no further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a relative module 'agent'. This is standard Python practice for package internal imports. No data reading, no untrusted sources, no data flows, and no suspicious constructs are present. The minimal code does not suggest malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, benign codebase.",
