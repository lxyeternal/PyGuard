{
  "purpose": "This code imports a module named 'agent' from the current package, serving to include its functionality within the package namespace.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from . import agent' reads the module 'agent' from the local package directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only performs a static import without data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the import is static and does not involve runtime data transfer or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import in Python, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain suspicious logic. The import statement is common in package structures and poses no security threat. Given the absence of anomalies or malicious indicators, the overall security risk is negligible. The high confidence score reflects certainty in this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are set to 0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
