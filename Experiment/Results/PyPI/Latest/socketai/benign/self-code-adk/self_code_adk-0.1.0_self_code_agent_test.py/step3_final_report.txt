  "purpose": "A pytest unit test verifying the number of files in a directory using get_my_application_code.",
  "sources": "The function call get_my_application_code('self_code') which reads the directory contents.",
  "sinks": "The test assertions on the length of files and errors; no untrusted data processing or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input: directory name 'self_code'; Output: list of files and errors checked by assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard pytest test that calls an external function to list files in a directory and asserts expected counts. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure operations are present. The external function's implementation is unknown but presumed safe given the context. The test does not process untrusted data beyond the controlled directory parameter. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately low (0 or near 0). Confidence in benign nature is high (around 0.9-1). No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are consistent with its behavior, and the overall security assessment should remain at minimal risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
