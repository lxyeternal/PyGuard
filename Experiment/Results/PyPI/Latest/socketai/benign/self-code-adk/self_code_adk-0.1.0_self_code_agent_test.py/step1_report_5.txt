{
  "purpose": "This code is a test script using pytest to verify the behavior of the get_my_application_code function in discovering application files within a specified directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'dir' parameter ('self_code') as input to get_my_application_code function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'self_code' is passed to get_my_application_code; the function's output is checked for correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious behavior, or unusual code are observed. The code is straightforward and typical for a test script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pytest and a specific function get_my_application_code. It parametrizes a test to check whether the directory 'self_code' contains exactly 3 files and no errors. The code only performs assertions on the output of the imported function. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard test for code discovery functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest test script verifying directory content. No malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation are present. It is a benign testing script with no security concerns.",
