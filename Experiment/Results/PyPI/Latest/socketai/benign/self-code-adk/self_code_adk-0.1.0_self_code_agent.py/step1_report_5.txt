  "purpose": "The code provides functions to discover application root directories, read source files, and instantiate an agent for analyzing its own codebase for debugging and understanding multi-agent applications.",
  "sources": "os.path.isdir, os.walk, os.path.join, os.path.relpath, open, re.search, sys.modules, sys.path",
  "sinks": "File reading operations (open), sys.modules for current module info",
  "flows": "Discovery of root directories -> reading file contents -> agent setup for code analysis",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system, sys.modules, and regex to manipulate paths; no direct malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles directory traversal, file reading, and agent instantiation. It filters hidden files and certain binary files, handles errors gracefully, and relies on user confirmation for root directory selection. No code performs external network access, data exfiltration, or backdoor activities. The agent setup appears intended for code analysis, not malicious purposes. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed for code discovery and analysis within a Python environment, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity observed. It implements standard directory and file operations, and its purpose aligns with debugging or understanding multi-agent applications. No malware or security risks are evident.",
