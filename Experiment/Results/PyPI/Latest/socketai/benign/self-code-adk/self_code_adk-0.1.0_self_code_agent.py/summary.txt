  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for source code discovery and analysis, with no signs of sabotage, malware, or malicious intent. The risk score should remain low (~0.1), primarily due to environment info exposure, which is typical for such tools. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero."
