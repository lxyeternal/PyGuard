  "purpose": "Utility functions for discovering project root directories and reading source code files, primarily for self-analysis and debugging of multi-agent Python applications.",
  "sources": "File system traversal via os.walk, reading files with open(), sys.modules for script path, environment info via sys and os modules.",
  "sinks": "Reading source files, accessing runtime environment info, no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Directory traversal -> file reading; sys.modules['__main__'] -> script location info; no external data flows or code execution beyond reading files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The code skips hidden/system files and limits file reads to prevent abuse.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory discovery and source code reading with proper error handling and safeguards. It uses standard libraries and a custom agent framework for self-analysis. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and designed for debugging or understanding application code. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk ~0.1) are consistent with its behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for source code discovery and analysis, with no signs of sabotage, malware, or malicious intent. The risk score should remain low (~0.1), primarily due to environment info exposure, which is typical for such tools. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero.",
