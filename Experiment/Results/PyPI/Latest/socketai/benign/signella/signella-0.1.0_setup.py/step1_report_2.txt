  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration script for packaging the 'signella' Python project, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file to obtain long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or sensitive operations; no network, file, or environment variable misuse.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README file into the long_description variable, which is then used in setup() without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools functions, reads a markdown file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated elements, or malicious logic. The only input source is a local file read operation, which is safe and standard. No untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks. The dependencies are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It only reads a local file and sets package metadata, which is standard practice.",
