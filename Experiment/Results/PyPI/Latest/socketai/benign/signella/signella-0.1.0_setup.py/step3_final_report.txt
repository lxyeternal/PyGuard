{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'signella' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; static metadata fields in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Reads local file, then executes setup() with static data; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script that reads a local README file and invokes setuptools.setup() with fixed package metadata and dependencies. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm the absence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, well-structured, and poses no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
