  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a straightforward setup.py script for a Python package called 'signella'.\n- The code reads a local README.md file for the long description.\n- It uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- All reports assign high confidence (1.0) and zero malware or security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct and standard for a setup.py script.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious code, malware, or suspicious activity.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are apparent; the code is static and safe.\n- **Dependencies:** Standard and well-known; no malicious dependencies.\n- **Data flow:** Only reading a local file, which is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n### Any anomalies or claims to challenge?\n- No anomalies or suspicious claims are present.\n- The reasoning is consistent and thorough.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\nGiven the comprehensive review, the code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, standard, and free from malicious behavior. The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis setup.py script is a typical, benign package configuration with no security concerns.",
