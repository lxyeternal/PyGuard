{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a module with a version identifier and imports a 'signal' object or function from a local 'signella' package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local 'signella' module/package.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or exposed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are observable in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; the import could be benign or part of larger functionality. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present. The import path '.signella' indicates a local module, which is not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and imports 'signal' from a local module. The minimal structure and local import do not suggest malicious intent. Without additional context or code, there are no evident security issues, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation techniques. The code is straightforward and lacks complex logic or external data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be a simple module setup, possibly part of a larger project. No malicious activity is detected based on this limited code.",
