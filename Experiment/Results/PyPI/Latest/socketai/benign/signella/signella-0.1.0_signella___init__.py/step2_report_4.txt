  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom .signella import signal\n\n__version__ = '0.1.0'\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues in the Code:\n- The code imports `signal` from a local module `signella` and defines a version string.\n- **No evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior** is present.\n- The import is from a relative module, which is typical in package initialization code.\n- The code is minimal and straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present in this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5 Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no suspicious activity.\n- They correctly identify that the code is minimal, importing a local component, and setting a version string.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8-1.0), which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- The malware scores are 0 across all reports, consistent with no malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal or no security risk. Given the code's simplicity, this is justified.\n\n**Any anomalies or assumptions?**  \n- All reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent without evidence.\n- The code is typical for a package's `__init__.py` or module setup, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n\n**Is there any reason to adjust scores?**  \n- No. The current scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal inherent risk of importing local modules, which is standard)\n\n**Justification:**  \n- No malicious activity detected.\n- The code is benign, standard package setup.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious behavior or payloads present.                                  |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation techniques.                |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1          | Very minimal risk; standard import statements in package code.             |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe initial reports are accurate; the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary based on this snippet.",
