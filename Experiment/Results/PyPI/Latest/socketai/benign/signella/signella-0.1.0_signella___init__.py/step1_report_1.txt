{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'signal' from a local module 'signella' and defines a version string. Its purpose appears to be setting up a module with versioning and importing a specific function.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'signella' and accesses its 'signal' function.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'signal' from 'signella' (source) but does not utilize it further; no data flow or execution flow is visible beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are evident. Importing a local module is standard, but without context, it could be benign or part of a larger malicious scheme.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and imports a function from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The import could be part of a larger package, but alone, it shows no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple module setup with an import and a version string. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this code alone.",
