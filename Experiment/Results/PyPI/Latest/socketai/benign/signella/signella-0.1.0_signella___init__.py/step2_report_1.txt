  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the correctness of their conclusions, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any additional risks are present.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is minimal: a simple import from a local module and a version string.\n- No data flows, external network activity, or user input handling are present.\n- The import is from a relative local module ('signella'), which is typical in package code.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code alone does not demonstrate malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The confidence level is 0.8, which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Benign, standard module setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The confidence is high (1), and no issues are found.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; import from local module.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0\n- **Note:** The securityRisk is slightly above zero (0.1), which might be overly cautious given the code. No external or suspicious activity is present.\n- **Verdict:** The securityRisk score could be lowered to 0, as there's no indication of risk beyond standard package structure.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Benign, straightforward import and version declaration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0\n- **Note:** Similar to above, the securityRisk is minimal and not justified by any suspicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Should also be lowered to 0 for securityRisk.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Benign, minimal code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0\n- **Note:** Same as above; no malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** SecurityRisk score can be reduced to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scoring adjustments:**\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **SecurityRisk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports; given the code's simplicity, this should be 0 unless there's additional context.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (more appropriate given the code)\n\n---\n\n### **Additional considerations:**\n- The code is very minimal and appears to be part of a larger package. Without the content of `signella`, we cannot assess if that module contains malicious code, but based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The import from a local module is typical in package initialization files (`__init__.py`) and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion:**\n\n- **My estimated scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\n- **Overall assessment:** The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious activity evident from this snippet. The minor securityRisk scores assigned in some reports should be lowered to reflect the lack of suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Work through the logic carefully, and ensure that no assumptions are made beyond the code provided.**",
