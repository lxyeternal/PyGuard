  "purpose": "Import the 'signal' object from the local 'signella' module and define the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.signella' module",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static import and version assignment",
  "anomalies": "Lack of context, but no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious activity evident",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific component 'signal' from a local module 'signella' and sets a version string. No user input, network operations, or data processing is present. The import is from a relative module, which is typical in package code. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module import and version declaration with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign.",
