  "purpose": "The code imports a 'signal' function or object from a local module named 'signella' and defines the package version.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .signella",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data, user input, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as the code only contains an import and a version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a local component and sets a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The import is from a local module, which is typical for package internal structure. No external network communication, data handling, or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign with no indication of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard module setup for a Python package.",
