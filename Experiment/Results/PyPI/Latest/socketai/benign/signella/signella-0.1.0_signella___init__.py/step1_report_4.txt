  "purpose": "The code imports a signal function from a local module named signella and sets the package version to 0.1.0.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .signella",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only a local import and version assignment are present",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no apparent anomalies or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code evident",
  "analysis": "The code is very simple, importing a function from a local module and setting a version string. There are no external inputs, no network activity, and no suspicious logic. Without additional context or the content of 'signella', it is impossible to detect malicious intent. The code appears benign and standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as an initialization script that imports a local function and sets a version. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
