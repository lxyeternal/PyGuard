  "purpose": "Minimal package module importing a local 'signal' from 'signella' and defining a version string.",
  "sources": "Import from local module '.signella', version string assignment",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, network activity, or external data handling",
  "flows": "Import statement does not involve external data; no data flows present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version declaration",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'signal' from a local module 'signella' and sets a version string. It is minimal, typical for package initialization files, with no suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious constructs. The import is from a relative module, common in package code, and no external activity or secrets are present. Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The minimal import and version declaration are standard in Python packages. The scores should reflect this benign assessment.",
