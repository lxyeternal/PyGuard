  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom .signella import signal\n\n__version__ = '0.1.0'\n```\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is minimal, performing a local import and defining a version string.\n- The import is from a relative module, `signella`, which could be part of the same package.\n- No data flows, network activity, user input, or external data handling are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the import and version string.\n- **Analysis:** Finds no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No user input or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.\n- **Note:** The securityRisk is set to 0.1, implying a slight concern. However, based solely on this code, there's no reason to assign even a small risk. The import is from a local module, which is typical.\n- **Verdict:** The small security risk score seems unwarranted here; it should probably be 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Note:** Same as above; the minimal risk is unjustified based solely on this snippet.\n- **Verdict:** Should be 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Note:** Again, the small risk score appears unwarranted.\n- **Verdict:** Should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations and Recommendations\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Most reports assign 0.1, which seems inconsistent with the code. The code is straightforward, with no external communication, no data handling, no suspicious patterns. Therefore, **the security risk should be 0** for all reports.\n- **Justification for higher risk scores:** No rationale exists here to justify a non-zero security risk score.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code snippet is benign.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correct at 0.\n- The security risk scores are overestimated; they should be 0.\n\n### My recommended scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code but overstate the security risk with a small non-zero score. I recommend setting the security risk to 0 across all reports.\n\n**Final note:** Without additional context—such as the content of `signella` or how `signal` is used elsewhere—there's no reason to suspect malicious intent here. The code appears to be a standard package module setup.",
