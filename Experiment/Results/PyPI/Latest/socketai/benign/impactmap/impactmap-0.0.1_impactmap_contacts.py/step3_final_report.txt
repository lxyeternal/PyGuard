  "purpose": "A minimal scaffold class for Contacts API with a client object, intended for future method implementations.",
  "sources": "The constructor (__init__) method reading the 'client' parameter.",
  "sinks": "No data inputs, outputs, or untrusted data flows present in the current code.",
  "flows": "Assignment of 'client' to self.client; no data flow beyond initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with only a placeholder comment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an initializer that stores a client object. It contains no active methods, data processing, or network operations. The code is a simple scaffold with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are consistent with its benign, incomplete state. Given the absence of active logic or data flows, the security risk is minimal. The high confidence scores are justified due to the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, incomplete class scaffold with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
