  "purpose": "Definition of a ContactsAPI class with a constructor that stores a client object",
  "sources": "Initialization method (__init__) which receives and stores a client object",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs are present in this code",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing is observable in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicates unimplemented API methods; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for interacting with contacts, with a constructor that accepts a client object. The class currently lacks any methods, and the only comment indicates future implementation. No data input/output, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, nor obfuscated features are present. It appears to be a placeholder or scaffold for a larger module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class scaffold with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It is likely part of a larger system; on its own, it shows no signs of malicious intent or security concerns.",
