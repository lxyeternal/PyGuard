{
  "purpose": "Placeholder class for Contacts API, intended to handle contact-related operations through a client",
  "sources": "Initialization of the class with a 'client' object",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output operations implemented",
  "flows": "No active data flows; class only initializes with a client object and contains a placeholder comment",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicates incomplete implementation; no actual code or logic to analyze",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a constructor that assigns a client object to an instance variable. There are no methods or data processing, and the only comment suggests future implementation. No data inputs, outputs, or logic exist to analyze for security issues or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a scaffold or stub without any executable logic or potentially malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal class scaffold with no functionality, data processing, or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risk or malware concern in its current form.",
