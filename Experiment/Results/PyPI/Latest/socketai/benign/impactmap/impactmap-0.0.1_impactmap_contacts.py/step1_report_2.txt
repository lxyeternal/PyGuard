{
  "purpose": "Defines a ContactsAPI class with an initialization method, presumably to interact with a contacts-related API.",
  "sources": "The constructor (__init__) reads the 'client' parameter, which may be external input when instantiating the class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform any data processing, output, or network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this snippet; the class is unimplemented and only stores a client object.",
  "anomalies": "The code is incomplete, with a TODO comment indicating unimplemented API methods. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an initializer that stores a 'client' object. There are no active data flows, no malicious code, and no suspicious behavior. The class appears to be a placeholder for future implementation. No signs of obfuscation or malware. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no security risks evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple class definition with a constructor that stores a client object. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, is incomplete, and serves as a placeholder. No security issues are detected.",
