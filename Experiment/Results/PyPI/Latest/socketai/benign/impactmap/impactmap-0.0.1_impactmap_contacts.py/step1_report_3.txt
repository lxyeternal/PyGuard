  "purpose": "Placeholder class definition for Contacts API, intended to interact with a client object.",
  "sources": "No data inputs or external data sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or data handling occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths exist within this code snippet as it is only a class skeleton.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a class definition with an unimplemented method, no malicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an initializer that stores a client object. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic. The comment indicates future implementation but currently no operational code or external interactions are present. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic class skeleton with no active or malicious code. It appears to be a standard placeholder for future API method implementations, presenting no security concerns.",
