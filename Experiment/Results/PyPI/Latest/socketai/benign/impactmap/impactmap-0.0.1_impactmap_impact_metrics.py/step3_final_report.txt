  "purpose": "A minimal class stub for Impact Metrics API, intended for future implementation.",
  "sources": "The constructor parameter 'client' which may be untrusted, but no data is processed.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, external calls, or data leaks occur in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No active data flows; only assignment of 'client' to an instance variable.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only a placeholder comment; no suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an __init__ method that assigns a 'client' parameter to an instance variable. It contains no data processing, external calls, or malicious code. The code is a stub for future API methods. No obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal nature results in very low security risk and malware likelihood. The 'client' parameter could be untrusted, but since it's not used beyond assignment, the risk remains negligible. The placeholder comment indicates incomplete implementation but does not introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal class stub with no malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's current state. No further action or concern is warranted.",
