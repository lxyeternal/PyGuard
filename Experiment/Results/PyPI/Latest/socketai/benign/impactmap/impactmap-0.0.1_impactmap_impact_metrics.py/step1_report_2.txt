{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for interacting with an Impact Metrics API, likely part of a larger application or SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'client' parameter passed to the constructor.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or misuse could occur if 'client' is an untrusted source, but the code itself does not process data directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'client' parameter into the class instance; no further processing is shown, and no data is transferred elsewhere in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The class contains a placeholder comment indicating unimplemented methods, which is not inherently suspicious but indicates incomplete functionality. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an API interaction class with an initializer that accepts a 'client' object, which may represent an API client or connection. There are no active methods or data processing routines, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is observable within this snippet. The placeholder comment suggests future implementation but does not raise security concerns on its own.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, serving as a scaffold for API interactions. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are evident from the provided code.",
