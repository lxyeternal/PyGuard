  "purpose": "Definition of a class ImpactMetricsAPI for interacting with impact metrics API, with a constructor accepting a client object.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'client' parameter during initialization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Input 'client' flows into the class attribute but no data flows are evident beyond assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; the class is unimplemented, and no malicious or suspicious activity is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an __init__ method that assigns the provided 'client' object to an instance attribute. It contains a placeholder comment indicating future API method implementations. There are no data processing, input/output operations, or suspicious behaviors present. The minimal code provides no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple class definition with no active or malicious code. It appears to be a standard placeholder for API methods. No security concerns or malware are evident.",
