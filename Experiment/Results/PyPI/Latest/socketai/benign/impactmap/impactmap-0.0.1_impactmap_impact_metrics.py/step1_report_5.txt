  "purpose": "Define a class ImpactMetricsAPI intended to interact with an API client for impact metrics.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal; it contains a placeholder comment indicating future implementation. No suspicious or unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an initializer that accepts a client object and assigns it to an instance variable. There is no actual implementation of API methods or data handling. The comment suggests future method implementations but currently contains no functionality. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident from this minimal code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic class definition with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a skeleton or stub for future development. No malware or security risks are detected.",
