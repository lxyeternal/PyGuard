  "purpose": "This code defines a class ImpactMetricsAPI intended to interface with impact metrics via a client object.",
  "sources": "The code receives a 'client' object during initialization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization passes 'client' to an instance variable, with no further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "The class is incomplete; it contains a TODO comment indicating future implementation. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are evident. No hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal, defining a class with a constructor that stores a client object. There is no implementation or data handling, making it unlikely to contain malicious behavior at this stage. The presence of a TODO suggests the class is a stub, awaiting further development. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple class stub with no malicious intent or security issues. It currently serves as a placeholder for future API method implementations. No security concerns are identified at this point.",
