  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\nAll five reports consistently describe the code as a standard, static setup script for packaging a Python library named \"impactmap.\" They emphasize that the code:\n- Uses standard setuptools functions.\n- Contains no dynamic input, external data reading, or network activity.\n- Has no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code.\n- Serves solely to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n\n**Confirmation of Issues:**\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are identified in the logic or reasoning.\n- The code is a typical setup.py script with static configuration data.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no security risk, which is justified.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Reasonableness:**\n- The scores seem consistent with the analysis. There are no claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions, nor any overlooked malicious activity.\n- The detailed reasoning supports that the code is benign.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nGiven the uniformity and thoroughness of the reports, the code appears to be a standard, safe setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** Since the code is static and straightforward, there's no justification for higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The package setup code is safe, benign, and free of security issues.",
