  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for packaging the impactmap Python SDK",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including find_packages(), and the import statements",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from source to sink involving untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows standard setup script structure without suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with static metadata for packaging the impactmap SDK. It specifies package details, dependencies, license, and classifiers. All information is hardcoded or derived from standard functions; no input handling, data processing, or network activity occurs. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard and straightforward, serving the purpose of package configuration without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
