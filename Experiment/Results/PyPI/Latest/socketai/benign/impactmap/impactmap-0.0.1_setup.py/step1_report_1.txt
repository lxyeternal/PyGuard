{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'impactmap', used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code does not read external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform any data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the script only defines package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The script uses standard setuptools functions and conventional syntax.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools to define the package's metadata. It specifies package name, version, description, author, required dependencies, Python version compatibility, URL, license, and classifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard, legitimate setup script for packaging a Python library.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a normal setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward package configuration file.",
