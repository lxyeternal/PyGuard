  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'impactmap', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data for package configuration, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or inputs that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows; the script merely defines package metadata and requirements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code strictly follows standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All data appears static and hardcoded with no user input or external data processing. No suspicious code execution, network activity, or data handling is present. The code appears to be a typical package setup script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
