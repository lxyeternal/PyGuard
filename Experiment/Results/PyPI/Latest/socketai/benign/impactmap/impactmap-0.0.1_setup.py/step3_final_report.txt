  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the impactmap Python SDK",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, find_packages() for package discovery",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no dynamic or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to specify package name, version, description, author, packages, dependencies, Python version requirement, URL, license, and classifiers. It contains no dynamic code, network calls, or input reading. The code is static, clear, and follows common packaging practices. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The analysis and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
