{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and configures a Python package named 'impactmap' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version, description, author, dependencies, URL, license, classifiers).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "The setup() function collects package info and dependencies; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code follows standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package metadata and dependencies, and calls setup(). It appears to be a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python package. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious logic are present. The only data read is static metadata, which is common in setup scripts. No code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended for package distribution purposes.",
