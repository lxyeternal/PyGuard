  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'impactmap' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and distribution settings.",
  "sources": "N/A (does not read external input or data during execution; static setup configuration).",
  "sinks": "N/A (does not perform data output or network communication; purely a package setup script).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code uses standard setup functions from setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls the setup() function with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It contains no code that reads external data or performs network operations. All elements are typical for Python package distribution. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices and contains no anomalies.",
