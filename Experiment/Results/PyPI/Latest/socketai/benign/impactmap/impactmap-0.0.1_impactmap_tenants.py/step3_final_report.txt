{
  "purpose": "API wrapper class for managing tenants, retrieving API key from environment, and requesting tenant data from an external service.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'IMPACTMAP_INTERNAL_API_KEY' for API key; client.request method for API calls.",
  "sinks": "Request method potentially sending data over network; no data leaks or untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read -> stored in internal_api_key -> used in list() method -> request sent via client.request -> filtered in get() method.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured API client that securely manages API keys via environment variables. It performs standard HTTP requests through an external client object, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The environment variable usage aligns with best practices, and the logic is simple and clear. External request handling is assumed secure; no data leaks or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure API wrapper with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. It correctly manages secrets and performs expected operations without suspicious patterns. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
