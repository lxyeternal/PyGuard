{
  "purpose": "Provides an API interface to list and retrieve tenant information, relying on an environment variable for authentication.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'IMPACTMAP_INTERNAL_API_KEY' for authentication; method parameter 'slug' for tenant lookup.",
  "sinks": "The environment variable is used internally; the request method may send data to an external endpoint.",
  "flows": "Internal API key is fetched from environment -> used in request header for API call -> tenant list fetched -> specific tenant filtered by slug.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no suspicious code patterns. Usage of environment variable is standard. No obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves an API key from environment variables and uses it for authorized API requests. The request method's implementation is external and not shown; assuming it handles data securely. The code does not perform any suspicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious network activity. It primarily facilitates API access with proper security checks. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, straightforward, and secure. It uses environment variables appropriately for sensitive credentials and does not contain any malicious logic. The overall security risk is low.",
