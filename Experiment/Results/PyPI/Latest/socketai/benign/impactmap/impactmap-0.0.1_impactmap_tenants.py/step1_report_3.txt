{
  "purpose": "This code provides an API client for interacting with tenant data from the impactmap service, primarily listing tenants and retrieving specific tenant details.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables via os.getenv(\"IMPACTMAP_INTERNAL_API_KEY\") and takes a parameter 'slug' in the get method.",
  "sinks": "The environment variable is used for API authentication, and the 'client.request' method likely makes an HTTP request, potentially exposing data if misused.",
  "flows": "The environment variable is checked for presence, then used for API requests. The 'slug' parameter is used to filter tenant data obtained from the API request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the API key is fetched from environment variables. No suspicious or unusual code structures, dynamic execution, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads an environment variable for API authentication, which is standard practice for secure key management. The 'list' method validates presence of the API key before making a request. The 'get' method filters tenant data by 'slug' after retrieving the full list. The code does not perform any dangerous operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. The use of environment variables for secrets is appropriate, and the API request appears straightforward without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client implementation for tenant management, with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security issues. It responsibly manages API keys via environment variables and makes simple HTTP requests. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
