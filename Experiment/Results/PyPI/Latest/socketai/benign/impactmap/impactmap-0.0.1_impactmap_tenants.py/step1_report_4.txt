{
  "purpose": "To manage tenant information by listing and retrieving tenants via an API client.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'IMPACTMAP_INTERNAL_API_KEY' for API authentication; input parameter 'slug' in get() method.",
  "sinks": "API request through self.client.request; uses environment variable for sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'IMPACTMAP_INTERNAL_API_KEY' flows from environment to internal_api_key; list() retrieves tenants; get() searches tenant list by slug.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no unusual or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves an API key from environment variables, which is a best practice. The methods perform standard operations: listing tenants and filtering by slug. There are no dynamic code executions, suspicious network calls beyond the intended API request, or data leaks. The use of environment variables minimizes risk of hardcoded secrets. The code appears straightforward and aligned with common patterns, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple API wrapper for tenant management, with secure handling of sensitive environment variables. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
