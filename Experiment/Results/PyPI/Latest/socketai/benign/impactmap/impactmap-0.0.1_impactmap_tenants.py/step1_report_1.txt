{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for interacting with a tenants API, including listing tenants and retrieving a specific tenant by slug.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'IMPACTMAP_INTERNAL_API_KEY' to obtain an API key for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Uses the API key to make a request to an external API endpoint '/saas/api/tenants' via the client's request method.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'IMPACTMAP_INTERNAL_API_KEY' is read and used as an authorization token in the request method to access external API data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code relies on environment variables, which is standard practice. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves an API key from environment variables rather than hardcoding secrets. It performs standard API requests through a provided client object. The functions are straightforward, performing API calls and filtering results. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The only potential concern is the reliance on external environment variables and the assumption that the client.request method is secure, but this is typical and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API wrapper for tenant management, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code. It securely uses environment variables for sensitive data and performs routine API interactions.",
