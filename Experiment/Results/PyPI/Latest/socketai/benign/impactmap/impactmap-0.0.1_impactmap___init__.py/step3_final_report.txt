{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing various API classes from local modules to set up the package namespace.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules: .client, .projects, .tenants, .contacts, .impact_metrics",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any runtime operations",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only performs static imports without data flow or execution paths",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard import statements and no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py file that imports classes from local modules to define the package API. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and static nature strongly suggest benign intent. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence level is high (1), given the straightforward import statements and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
