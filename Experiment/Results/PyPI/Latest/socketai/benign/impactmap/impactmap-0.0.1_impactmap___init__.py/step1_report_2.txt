  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing core API classes for impact mapping functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the impactmap package",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; just module imports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated segments; straightforward import statements",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initialization file importing various API classes from local modules. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious or malicious code present. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving to expose module interfaces.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
