  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code: a straightforward `__init__.py` file importing local modules/classes.\n- The code performs no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the original code snippet provided.\n- No issues are present in the code.\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Logical flaws or errors:\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n- The assessments correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are reasonable and justified.\n- Since there's no malicious activity or obfuscation, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code is purely an import initializer, which is inherently safe.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on the code's actual content.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n**Based on all reports and the code analysis, I concur with the current scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the benign, standard nature of the code. No further action is necessary.",
