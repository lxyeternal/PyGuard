  "purpose": "Initialization of the impactmap package by importing key classes and APIs.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .client, .projects, .tenants, .contacts, .impact_metrics.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data processing, network communication, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules/classes into the namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources or sink points.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and typical for a package __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements to expose internal modules and classes. No code execution, user input handling, or data processing occurs here. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a standard package initializer, exposing classes and APIs for use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
