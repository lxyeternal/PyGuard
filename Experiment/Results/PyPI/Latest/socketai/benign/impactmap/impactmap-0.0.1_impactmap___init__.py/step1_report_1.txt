{
  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing various API classes related to impact mapping, projects, tenants, contacts, and impact metrics.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules within the package",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code only performs imports",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules to make classes available at the package level",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file for a Python package, importing specific classes from local modules to expose API interfaces. There are no data inputs, environment variables, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module initializer with standard import statements. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
