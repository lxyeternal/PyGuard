  "purpose": "Initialize the impactmap package by importing key API classes for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; imports from local module files.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs imports and does not process data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports classes from local modules within the package. There are no input sources, data flows, or sinks that could be exploited. The code structure is straightforward and standard for package initialization files. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no signs of malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This file is a standard package __init__ that imports API classes for use elsewhere. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
