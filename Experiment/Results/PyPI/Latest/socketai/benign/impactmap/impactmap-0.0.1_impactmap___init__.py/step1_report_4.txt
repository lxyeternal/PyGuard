{
  "purpose": "Initialize the impactmap package by importing various API classes for use elsewhere in the module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local module files: .client, .projects, .tenants, .contacts, .impact_metrics.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports are static and do not involve data flow from untrusted sources; no runtime data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard for package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py file importing classes from local modules within the package. It does not execute any runtime code, perform network operations, or handle external input. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The structure is typical for Python packages, and the imports are explicit and static.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves to expose classes for external use, with no suspicious or harmful behavior detected.",
