{
  "purpose": "The code performs SSL/TLS certificate fetching, validation, intermediates retrieval via AIA, transparency checks via crt.sh, CRL checks, and comprehensive certificate analysis including profile detection and certificate chain validation.",
  "sources": "Network connections to domain:443, reading peer certificates, fetching intermediates from URLs in AIA extension, querying crt.sh for transparency records.",
  "sinks": "Fetching certificates over network, reading certificate extensions, external URL requests, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Connect to domain -> fetch leaf certificate -> parse extensions -> fetch intermediates from URLs -> validate chain -> perform CRL and transparency checks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of insecure context fallback (disabling verification) controlled via parameter; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; standard network and cryptography operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive SSL/TLS certificate analysis utility that fetches certificates, intermediates, validates chains, and performs transparency and CRL checks. It uses standard libraries and handles errors appropriately. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The insecure mode is an explicit, documented feature for testing, not malicious. External URL fetches and certificate parsing are routine for such tools. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SSL/TLS certificate analysis tool with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The use of insecure mode is a controlled, documented feature, not an indicator of malicious behavior. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
