{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to download, parse, and check the revocation status of X.509 certificates via CRL (Certificate Revocation List) distribution points.",
  "sources": "URL inputs in the download_crl function; certificate extensions in check_crl function.",
  "sinks": "Downloading CRLs over HTTP/HTTPS; parsing CRL data; logging outputs; returning revocation status information.",
  "flows": "The code takes a URL from download_crl, retrieves CRL data, parses it, then in check_crl, reads certificate extensions for CDP URLs, downloads CRLs from those URLs, and checks for revocation status.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network behavior. The code handles errors gracefully, with proper logging. It performs CRL checking following standard procedures, with no unusual or malicious code paths. The use of standard libraries and functions appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code securely fetches CRLs over HTTP/HTTPS, parses them, and checks revocation status based on the certificate's extensions. It includes exception handling and logging for various failure modes, such as missing extensions, download failures, and parse errors. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors. The functions adhere to standard practices for certificate revocation checking. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate CRL retrieval and checking process with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It follows standard security protocols for certificate revocation checking and employs safe exception handling. Overall, it appears secure and benign.",
