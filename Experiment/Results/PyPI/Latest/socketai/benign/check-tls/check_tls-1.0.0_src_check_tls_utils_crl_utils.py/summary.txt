  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of CRL checking for certificate revocation status. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reliance on external URLs is typical for such functionality and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible."
