  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task (not provided in the prompt), possibly related to data processing or interaction with external systems.",
  "sources": "Input sources may include environment variables, user input functions, or external data files (exact sources are not visible in the prompt).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or system commands, but specific details are not provided in the prompt.",
  "flows": "Data likely flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are apparent from the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is empty or not included, so a detailed step-by-step analysis is not possible. Based on typical code review standards, no malicious patterns are evident, and the code does not display signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Without concrete code, it is difficult to identify specific source-to-sink flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code content, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign or is simply not provided for review.",
