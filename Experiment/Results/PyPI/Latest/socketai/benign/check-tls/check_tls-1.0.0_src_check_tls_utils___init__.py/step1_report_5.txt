  "purpose": "Analyze the provided code for malicious behavior, security risks, and obfuscation to ensure supply chain integrity.",
  "sources": "Input sources include any function or method that reads data from user input, environment variables, files, or network requests.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission functions, file write operations, system commands, or data storage points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths from input sources to sinks, especially if untrusted data reaches sensitive operations without validation.",
  "anomalies": "Check for hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, dynamic code execution, misleading variable names, or obfuscated code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly at the start, middle, and end. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns such as dynamic eval, exec, or hidden backdoors were identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard; no anomalies in their application. No hardcoded credentials or secret tokens are present. Data flows from inputs to outputs are straightforward with no signs of malicious manipulations. The code structure and formatting are typical of legitimate modules.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be benign with standard functionality and no suspicious activity detected.",
