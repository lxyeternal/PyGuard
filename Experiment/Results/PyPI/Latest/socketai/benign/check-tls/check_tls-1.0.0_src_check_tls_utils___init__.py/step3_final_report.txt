  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code or analysis.",
  "sources": "N/A (no code provided in reports; analysis based on absence of code and descriptions).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data flow analysis possible without code).",
  "flows": "N/A (no source-to-sink flows due to lack of code).",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code prevents detection of anomalies; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed or indicated.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly note the absence of code, leading to appropriate low malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. Confidence levels vary based on the thoroughness of reasoning; high confidence (0.9) is justified where detailed analysis is provided. The scores are consistent with the lack of evidence for malicious activity or obfuscation. Minor adjustments in confidence for reports with no code could improve accuracy, but overall, assessments are aligned with the available information.",
  "conclusion": "Given the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The reports' scores are appropriate and consistent with their reasoning. The overall supply chain security posture appears minimal risk, with scores reflecting the lack of suspicious activity.",
