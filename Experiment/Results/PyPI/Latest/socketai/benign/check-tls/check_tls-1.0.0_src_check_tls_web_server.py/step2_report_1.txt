  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as a Flask app for TLS analysis, with inputs from form and JSON payloads. No external untrusted data sources beyond user input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** User inputs lead to calls to `analyze_certificates`. No dangerous command execution or data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The external function `analyze_certificates` is trusted, and the code mainly handles presentation and orchestration.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar findings as Report 1, emphasizing standard Flask practices, safe input handling, and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, a benign description of a TLS analysis web interface, with no suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates the same, noting safe handling of user data, no dangerous code, and reliance on external `analyze_certificates`.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, confirming benign, standard practices, no obfuscation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports agree there's no malware present. The code is primarily a web interface delegating analysis to an external function, which is assumed to be safe.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are generally low (0.1-0.2), which aligns with the benign nature of the code. Given the code's purpose and the lack of malicious indicators, these seem appropriate.\n- **Malware Score Justification:** Since no malicious activity is detected, a malware score of 0 is justified. The code does not perform any dangerous operations, and the analysis relies on an external trusted module.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; input validation is minimal but standard, and no dangerous code execution is present.\n- **Consistency:** Scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, due to potential external dependencies and web exposure, but nothing suspicious)\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.**",
