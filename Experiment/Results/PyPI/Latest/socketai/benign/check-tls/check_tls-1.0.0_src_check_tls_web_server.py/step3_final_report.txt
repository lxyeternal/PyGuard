{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Flask-based web server providing TLS certificate analysis via user input forms and JSON API, delegating the core analysis to an external 'analyze_certificates' function.",
  "sources": "User input from form fields ('domains') and JSON payload ('domains' list).",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'analyze_certificates' function; outputs rendered as HTML or JSON responses.",
  "flows": "User inputs are processed and passed directly to 'analyze_certificates'; results are then formatted for display or API response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. External modules are assumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Flask web interface that securely handles user input, calls an external analysis function, and displays results. No dangerous operations, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The external 'analyze_certificates' function is trusted in this context. Input validation is minimal but standard. No signs of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The low risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are justified given its purpose and implementation. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is 0, indicating a safe, standard TLS analysis web app.",
