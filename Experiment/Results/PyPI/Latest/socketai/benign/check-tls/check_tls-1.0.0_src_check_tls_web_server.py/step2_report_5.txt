  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the provided descriptions, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies that the code implements a Flask web server for TLS analysis, handles user input securely, and delegates analysis to `analyze_certificates`. It notes no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code does not perform dangerous operations, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code. The analysis appears thorough and justified.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (low, as it’s a web app primarily for analysis)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that the code is a benign TLS analysis web service, with standard input handling, no suspicious code, and external dependencies that are common.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No signs of malicious activity or backdoors. The external CDN and external `analyze_certificates` are not suspicious per se.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (very low)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes a standard TLS analysis web interface, with proper input handling, no hardcoded secrets, and reliance on external modules. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The logic is consistent. The external `analyze_certificates` is assumed to be safe, and the code does not perform dangerous operations.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1  \n  - Obfuscated: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, describes a safe, standard Flask app that calls an external analysis function. No malicious code, backdoors, or unsafe practices.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2  \n  - Obfuscated: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, emphasizes benign handling, no suspicious code, no secrets, and standard patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No malicious signs.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2  \n  - Obfuscated: 0\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It mainly orchestrates TLS analysis via external modules.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate no obfuscation, which matches the code clarity.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—web interface for TLS analysis, delegating security checks to external trusted modules—the risk is minimal. The scores range from 0.1 to 0.2, which seems reasonable.\n\n- **Critical points:**  \n  - The code relies on an external `analyze_certificates` function. If this function is malicious, it could introduce risk. However, based solely on this code snippet and the reports, there's no evidence of malicious behavior within this code itself.  \n  - The code handles user input securely, with no dangerous operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Overall malware score:** **0** (no signs of malicious code)  \n**Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)  \n**Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (very low, standard web app pattern)\n\n**My final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.15 (average of the reports' scores, reflecting very low risk)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code appears safe and free from malicious intent or obfuscation. The main consideration remains the trustworthiness of the external `analyze_certificates` function, but within this scope, the code itself is benign.",
