  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project. The code imports `setuptools`, specifies package metadata, dependencies, source directory, and CLI entry points. There are no dynamic or runtime data flows, nor any code that processes untrusted input.\n\n2. **Malicious Indicators & Anomalies**  \n- No report mentions suspicious URLs, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs.\n- The URL (`https://github.com/obeone/check-tls`) and author information appear legitimate.\n- Dependencies are common Python libraries (`cryptography`, `coloredlogs`, `flask`) with no signs of malicious payloads.\n- The entry point `check_tls.main:main` points to a function in the package, which is standard for CLI tools.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \n- No logical errors or flaws are identified across reports.\n- The setup script follows best practices: source code in `src`, clear metadata, standard dependency list, and CLI entry point.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification**  \n- All reports assign `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, with confidence=1, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- The scores are reasonable given the evidence.\n\n5. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**  \n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis correctly notes the absence of suspicious behavior.\n- The absence of runtime code, network activity, or code injection reduces the risk profile significantly.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency & Critical Evaluation**  \n- The reports are consistent with each other.\n- The detailed reasoning aligns with the code content.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — standard setup script with no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or security risks detected.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The scores are appropriate. No changes needed.",
