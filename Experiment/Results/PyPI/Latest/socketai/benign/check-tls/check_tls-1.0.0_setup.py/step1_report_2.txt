{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'check-tls' Python project, specifying metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Metadata fields (name, version, author, url, license), find_packages(), install_requires, entry_points",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; setup script primarily for packaging, not runtime data handling",
  "flows": "The setup process reads package info, dependencies, and entry point configuration; does not process untrusted input at runtime",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; straightforward setup configuration, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes setuptools to configure package metadata, dependencies, and command-line entry points. It references source code located in 'src' directory via find_packages. There are no dynamic code executions, no input processing, and no suspicious patterns. The dependencies listed are common security and web libraries. The author and URL information appear legitimate and standard for open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard packaging tasks without any suspicious or malicious code.",
