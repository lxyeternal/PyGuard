{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'check-tls', specifying its metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters in the setup() function, including package discovery, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; the setup script primarily prepares package installation details and does not process untrusted data at runtime.",
  "flows": "N/A - The script sets up package metadata and dependencies; no runtime data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs, or unusual code constructs are present. The URL and author info appear legitimate. No malicious code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, code injection, or data exfiltration. The author information and URL are typical for open-source projects. The dependencies listed are common libraries. The structure is typical and straightforward. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious logic found.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup configuration for a legitimate package without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
