{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'check-tls', specifying metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from variables, function calls (find_packages, setup), and the 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks for untrusted data that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions within this script.",
  "flows": "The setup function consolidates metadata and dependencies; no data flows from external untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present. All strings and function calls are standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to configure package installation, including metadata (name, version, author, URL), package discovery from 'src', and dependencies. The entry point creates a console script. There are no indications of malicious or unusual behavior. The code appears to be a typical setup.py configuration file for a Python package, with no embedded malicious logic or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is used to define package metadata and dependencies, with no suspicious or malicious elements detected.",
