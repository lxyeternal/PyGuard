  "purpose": "This setup.py script configures a Python package named 'check-tls' with specified metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points, facilitating package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependency list, author info, URL, and CLI entry point definition; no dynamic input or untrusted data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script is static and does not involve runtime data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; standard use of setuptools with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, utilizing setuptools to specify package metadata, dependencies, source directory, and CLI entry points. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, or runtime data flows. Dependencies are common libraries, and the author URL appears legitimate. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The structure and content align with best practices for Python packaging. All signals indicate a benign, straightforward setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a legitimate, benign package configuration script with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or security risks detected. The code is straightforward and standard, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
