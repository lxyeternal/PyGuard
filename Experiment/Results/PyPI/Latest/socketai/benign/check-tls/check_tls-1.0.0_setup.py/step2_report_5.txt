  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected.\n- Dependencies are common, and no untrusted data processing occurs.\n- Entry points are typical for CLI tools.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are consistent across reports.\n- The author info and URL appear legitimate.\n- The use of `find_packages(where='src')` indicates source code is in a separate directory, which is standard practice.\n- The malware scores are all 0, aligning with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are uniformly confident (score 1) about the benign nature, which seems reasonable given the evidence.\n- The obfuscated scores are all 0, which matches the lack of obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- All reports assume the setup script is for a legitimate package. Given the information, this appears correct.\n- No report suggests any hidden or malicious payload, which is consistent with the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided setup.py and reports, I concur with the assessments. The code is a standard, benign package configuration. No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the thorough analysis presented.",
