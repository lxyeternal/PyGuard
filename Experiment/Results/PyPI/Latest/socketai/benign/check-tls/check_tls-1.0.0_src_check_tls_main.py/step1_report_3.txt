{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface and web server to analyze TLS certificates for specified domains, including certificate validation, transparency, and CRL checks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include command-line arguments for domains, JSON, or CSV output files, and user-provided options such as flags for server mode and insecure connections.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output to files or stdout, network interactions via run_server and analyze_certificates functions, and external modules that may perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (sources) influence analysis functions (sinks), which process domain data, perform network requests, and generate outputs. Data flows from user input through analysis functions to output files or the console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic code execution. The code primarily orchestrates analysis functions imported from external modules without direct network or file manipulation within this script.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages user input, logging, and orchestrates analysis and output formatting. It calls external functions like run_analysis and analyze_certificates, which are not included here. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful network activity within this code snippet itself. The code appears to be standard for a CLI wrapper around TLS analysis modules, with proper validation of inputs and options. The only potential concern is reliance on external modules that may perform network requests or handle sensitive data, but this is typical for such a tool and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate TLS analysis CLI and server interface, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It orchestrates analysis functions securely and outputs results in a user-friendly format. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious code segments are evident.",
