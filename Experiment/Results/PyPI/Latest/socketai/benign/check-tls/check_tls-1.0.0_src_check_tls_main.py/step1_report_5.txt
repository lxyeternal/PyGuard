{
  "purpose": "This script serves as a command-line interface for analyzing TLS certificates for specified domains, including certificate validation, transparency, and CRL checks, with options to run as a web server or generate reports.",
  "sources": "Input domains via command-line arguments; configuration parameters via CLI options; imported functions from external modules (check_tls.tls_checker, check_tls.web_server).",
  "sinks": "Function calls such as run_server(), analyze_certificates(), run_analysis(), which may handle external data or generate output reports; printing results to stdout; writing JSON/CSV files based on user input.",
  "flows": "Input domain arguments -> analyze_certificates() for each domain -> results processed and optionally passed to run_analysis() -> output rendered as human-readable, JSON, or CSV reports.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The script primarily calls external functions; however, it facilitates network operations and data output based on user input. The code appears standard for a CLI tool.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and custom modules to perform TLS analysis. It processes command-line arguments to determine behavior, including network operations such as running a web server or analyzing domains. The main functions involve calling external modules to perform network and certificate checks, then displaying or saving results. No suspicious or malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors, is evident. The code handles user input securely, with no evident injection points or insecure handling of data. It relies on external modules for core functionality, which are assumed to be safe; the script itself does not contain malicious logic or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code functions as a standard CLI wrapper for TLS certificate analysis, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manages input, output, and orchestrates external library calls without performing any suspicious operations internally.",
