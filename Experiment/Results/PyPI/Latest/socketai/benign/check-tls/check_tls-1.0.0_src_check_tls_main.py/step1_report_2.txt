{
  "purpose": "This script serves as a command-line interface for analyzing TLS certificates of specified domains, providing summaries and optional output formats or running as a web server.",
  "sources": "Input domains from command-line arguments; configuration options from command-line arguments; imported functions from check_tls modules.",
  "sinks": "Analysis results are printed to stdout; JSON or CSV outputs are written to specified files; run_server may start a web server (details not provided).",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments → function calls (analyze_certificates, run_server) → data processing → output (print or file)",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic observed; code is structured for legitimate TLS analysis.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily parses user inputs, configures logging, and calls external functions to perform TLS certificate analysis. It outputs structured summaries or delegates to server functions. There are no signs of malicious data handling, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The external functions are imported and not shown, but their use appears consistent with standard analysis workflows. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activities are evident within this script. The script relies on standard Python libraries and known modules, and the control flow is straightforward, serving legitimate purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI and server launcher for TLS certificate analysis with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates as expected for a security analysis tool, with no embedded malware or suspicious code flows.",
