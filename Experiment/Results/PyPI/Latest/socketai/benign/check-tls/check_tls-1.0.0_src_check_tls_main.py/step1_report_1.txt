  "purpose": "CLI tool for analyzing TLS certificates and running a web server for TLS analysis.",
  "sources": "User-provided domain names via command-line arguments, command-line arguments for modes and options.",
  "sinks": "Functions that process domains, output results to JSON or CSV files, and start a server.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> domain list or server mode -> analyze_certificates or run_server -> output or display results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution. Use of subprocesses or network connections appears only in imported functions, which are not shown here.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles command-line parsing, invokes functions for TLS analysis, and outputs results. It imports functions from external modules ('check_tls.tls_checker' and 'check_tls.web_server') but does not contain network operations or credential handling itself. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms in this snippet. The code does include options to run as an HTTP server and to perform certificate transparency and CRL checks, which are standard for TLS analysis tools. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are observed. The potential security concern could be from the imported functions, but within this code, the logic is straightforward and intended for legitimate TLS auditing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate TLS analysis CLI tool with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It processes user input securely and delegates analysis to imported modules. There are no hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code in this snippet. The security risk is minimal but depends on the trustworthiness of imported modules.",
