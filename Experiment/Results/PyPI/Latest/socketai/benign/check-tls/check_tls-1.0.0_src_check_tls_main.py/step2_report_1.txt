  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a CLI tool for TLS analysis, importing external modules (`check_tls.tls_checker`, `check_tls.web_server`). No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are observed. The logic is straightforward, focusing on parsing inputs and delegating analysis.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The confidence is high (0.9). The reasoning is sound; no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the script is a CLI and server launcher for TLS analysis, with no suspicious code or secrets. External modules are used for core functionality.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, consistent with the absence of suspicious code. The analysis appears reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script manages user input, invokes analysis functions, and outputs results. No evidence of malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation. The analysis notes reliance on external modules, which is typical.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, matching the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a CLI for TLS analysis, with no signs of malicious code or secrets. It mainly orchestrates external functions, which are not shown but are presumed safe.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing that the script is a standard CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation. It relies on external modules.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Issues in Code:** The code appears clean, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behaviors. It is a typical CLI wrapper for TLS analysis, delegating core functions to imported modules.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No evident logical errors or security flaws within this script. The analysis correctly notes the reliance on external modules, which could be a concern if those modules are malicious, but within this code snippet, there's no evidence.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n  - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n  - **Risk Score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, the risk score of 0.1–0.2 in reports seems appropriate. The overall risk is low, assuming external modules are trustworthy.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:**\n  - The main vulnerability could stem from the imported modules (`check_tls.tls_checker`, `check_tls.web_server`). If those contain malicious code, the overall risk could increase. However, based solely on this script, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n  - The script allows running a server and performing network operations, but these are standard for such tools.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** (low, primarily due to reliance on external modules; minimal internal risk)\n\n**Note:** The actual security posture depends on the trustworthiness of the imported modules. If those modules are verified as safe, the overall risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, straightforward CLI tool for TLS certificate analysis with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The risk is minimal, contingent on external module security.",
