{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for analyzing TLS certificates of specified domains, including optional web server operation and report generation.",
  "sources": "User-supplied domain names via command-line arguments; command-line arguments for configuration (e.g., --json, --csv, --mode, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Analysis functions that process domain input and generate reports; potential output files specified by user.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line → Parsed arguments → analyze_certificates or run_server → Data processing → Output reports or summaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly handles argument parsing, logging setup, and invoking external analysis functions. It safely processes user inputs to analyze TLS certificates and generate reports. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration routines are present within this script. It relies on imported modules for core functionality, which are not provided here, but based on the visible code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate CLI tool for TLS certificate analysis. No malicious code, backdoors, or security risks are evident in this implementation. It securely handles user inputs and directs them to trusted functions for analysis and reporting.",
