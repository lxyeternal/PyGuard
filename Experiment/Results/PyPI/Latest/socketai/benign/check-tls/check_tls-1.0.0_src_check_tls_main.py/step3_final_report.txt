{
  "purpose": "A CLI tool for analyzing TLS certificates of specified domains, with options for server operation, report formats, and various validation checks.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, external modules (`check_tls.tls_checker`, `check_tls.web_server`) invoked for core analysis functions.",
  "sinks": "Analysis functions potentially perform network requests; output is printed to stdout or written to files, but no untrusted data handling or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "flows": "User provides domains and options -> main() invokes analyze_certificates or run_server -> external modules perform TLS analysis or run server -> results are formatted and outputted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected. The code is a straightforward orchestrator delegating core logic to external modules.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard CLI wrapper for TLS analysis, with clear structure and no signs of malicious behavior. It relies on external modules for core functionality, which are not shown but presumed safe. No embedded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The code handles user input securely and outputs formatted results. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured TLS analysis CLI tool with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The overall risk score is minimal, assuming external modules are trustworthy.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
