  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the associated code to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or inconsistencies.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code consists of helper functions for parsing X.509 certificates: calculating days until expiry, fingerprinting, extracting public key details, signature algorithms, SCT presence, SANs, and common name.\n- All functions operate solely on provided certificate objects.\n- No external data, network calls, or untrusted input handling is involved.\n- Exception handling is present but used to prevent crashes, not to mask malicious behavior.\n- The code uses standard cryptography library functions and patterns.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **No.** All reports conclude the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior. The code appears correct and secure for its purpose.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports?**  \n  **No.** Each report consistently states the code is straightforward, standard, and safe, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores Given (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk):**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Risk Score Justification:**  \n  Since the code is purely for certificate parsing and extraction, with no external interactions or data manipulations, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. The reports' scores seem appropriate.\n\n- **Malware Score Justification:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity or intent.\n\n- **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n  All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as benign.\n\n- **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Estimation:\n- The code is a standard utility module for certificate analysis.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The reports are thorough and align with the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- No further action needed; the code is safe and well-understood.\n- The detailed reasoning confirms that the reports are accurate and appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scoring and no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
