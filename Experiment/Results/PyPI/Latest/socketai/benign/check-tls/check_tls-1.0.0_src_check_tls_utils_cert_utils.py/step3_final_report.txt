  "purpose": "Helper functions for certificate parsing, fingerprints, key details, etc.",
  "sources": "Certificate attributes such as not_valid_after, fingerprint, public_key, signature_hash_algorithm, extensions for SCT, SAN, and common name.",
  "sinks": "None; the code operates solely on provided certificate objects without external data or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Functions extract data from certificate attributes and extensions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and uses cryptography library functions without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for parsing X.509 certificates, including calculating days until expiry, fingerprinting, extracting public key details, signature algorithms, SCT presence, SANs, and common name. It operates only on certificate objects, with exception handling to prevent crashes. No external data, network calls, or untrusted input processing is involved. The functions are standard and do not perform malicious actions or data leakage. No signs of obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is benign and suitable for certificate analysis purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for certificate inspection with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
