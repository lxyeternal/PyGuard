  "purpose": "Helper functions for parsing X.509 certificates, extracting fingerprints, key details, signatures, and extensions.",
  "sources": "Certificate object properties and extensions, such as not_valid_after, fingerprint, public_key, signature_hash_algorithm, and extensions like SCT and SAN.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the extraction of public key details and fingerprint data, but these are standard for certificate analysis and do not pose a security risk.",
  "flows": "Input certificate objects -> data extraction functions -> returned values such as fingerprints, key types, signature algorithms, and extensions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. Functions are straightforward and serve certificate parsing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for handling cryptography certificates. It accesses certificate attributes and extensions securely and appropriately, with fallback mechanisms and error handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or backdoors, is evident. The functions operate solely on provided certificate objects, with no external inputs or outputs that could be exploited maliciously. The use of cryptography library features appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of helper functions for certificate analysis, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is well-structured and focused on extracting certificate information securely.",
