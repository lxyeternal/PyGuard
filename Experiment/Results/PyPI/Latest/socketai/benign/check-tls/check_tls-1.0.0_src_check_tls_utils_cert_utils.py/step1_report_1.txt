{
  "purpose": "Helper functions for parsing and extracting information from X.509 certificates, including fingerprints, key details, expiration, and extensions.",
  "sources": "Reads certificate attributes and extensions, including not_valid_after, public_key, signature_hash_algorithm, and extensions for SCTs and SANs.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external communication; functions primarily process certificate objects and produce data outputs.",
  "flows": "Certificate data flows from the certificate object to various extraction functions, with no external or untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for certificate parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for handling X.509 certificates: calculating days until expiry, fingerprinting, retrieving public key details, signature algorithms, checking for SCTs, extracting SANs, and common name. All functions operate on provided certificate objects and do not involve external inputs, user data, or network operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is standard and appears intended for certificate analysis within security or validation contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard certificate parsing and extraction tasks with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign utility module with no signs of malware, data leakage, or sabotage.",
