  "purpose": "Helper functions for parsing and extracting information from X.509 certificates, including fingerprints, key details, expiration, and extensions.",
  "sources": "Reads data from certificate objects, including attributes like not_valid_after, public key, extensions, and signature algorithm.",
  "sinks": "None that process untrusted input directly; functions mainly access certificate attributes and extensions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; functions extract and process certificate data without untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution. Use of cryptography library functions is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions to analyze X.509 certificates, such as calculating days until expiry, fingerprinting, key type detection, signature algorithm retrieval, SCT presence, SAN extraction, and common name retrieval. It interacts only with certificate objects, does not handle external inputs directly, and performs standard cryptographic processing. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and follows typical patterns for certificate analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of benign helper functions for certificate analysis, with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a certificate validation or inspection tool.",
