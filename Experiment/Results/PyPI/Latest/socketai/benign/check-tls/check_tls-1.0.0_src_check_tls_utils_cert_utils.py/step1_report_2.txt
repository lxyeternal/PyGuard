  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing and extracting information from X.509 certificates, including fingerprints, public key details, signature algorithms, SCT presence, SANs, and common names.",
  "sources": "Certificate object passed as input to functions such as calculate_days_remaining, get_sha256_fingerprint, get_public_key_details, get_signature_algorithm, has_scts, extract_san, get_common_name.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions perform data writes, network communications, or untrusted data outputs. They only read certificate data and process it internally.",
  "flows": "Input certificate object flows into various functions; extracted data such as fingerprints, public key info, and extensions are returned without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code uses standard cryptography library functions and handles exceptions gracefully. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of certificate parsing utilities that extract metadata and cryptographic information. All functions rely on standard cryptography library calls, perform no network or file I/O beyond parsing, and do not process untrusted user input in a dangerous manner. Exception handling is used to prevent crashes but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, malicious data leakage, or sabotage mechanisms. The functions are read-only and serve legitimate purposes related to certificate inspection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a collection of benign certificate parsing functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard operations with proper exception handling, and no malicious activity or backdoors are present.",
