  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing and extracting information from X.509 certificates, such as fingerprint calculation, key details, validity periods, and extensions.",
  "sources": "Certificate object properties and extensions, especially 'not_valid_after', 'fingerprint', 'public_key', 'signature_hash_algorithm', 'extensions'.",
  "sinks": "None in this code; functions only read data from certificate objects and perform standard processing.",
  "flows": "Certificate data is read from the input 'cert' parameter, processed within functions, with no external data flow or untrusted output manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. Use of cryptography library functions appears standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper functions to extract specific certificate information, such as days remaining until expiry, SHA256 fingerprint, public key details, signature algorithm, SCT presence, SAN entries, and common name. All operations involve reading properties or extensions from a certificate object without executing untrusted code or external commands. No dynamic code execution, no network access, nor any form of data leakage or backdoor mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard, safe utility functions for certificate analysis, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
