{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to query crt.sh for SSL/TLS certificate information related to a given domain and its parent domains, likely for security analysis or domain reputation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the domain name input to generate parent domains; makes HTTP requests to crt.sh with the domain or parent domains as query parameters.",
  "sinks": "Processes the JSON response from crt.sh, storing unique certificate entries; no data is written to external systems or files within this code.",
  "flows": "User provides a domain -> get_parent_domains generates list -> query_crtsh makes HTTP request to crt.sh -> processes response -> query_crtsh_multi calls query_crtsh for each parent domain with delay.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Uses standard library functions; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution. Logging is routine and does not leak data. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code injection.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations: generating parent domains, querying a public API via HTTPS, parsing JSON, and handling errors gracefully. No hardcoded secrets or malicious data leaks are evident. Exception handling is appropriate for network operations. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signatures are detected. It simply retrieves certificate info for analysis. The sleep delay is a polite measure to avoid overloading the API, not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate security utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign and routine implementation for querying crt.sh for certificate information related to domains. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks present in this module.",
