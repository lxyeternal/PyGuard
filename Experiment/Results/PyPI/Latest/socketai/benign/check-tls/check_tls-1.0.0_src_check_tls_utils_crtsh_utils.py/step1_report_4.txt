{
  "purpose": "The code queries crt.sh for SSL certificate data related to a specific domain and its parent domains.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through the 'domain' parameter; domain string processing occurs within get_parent_domains; network requests are made in query_crtsh and query_crtsh_multi.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the network request to crt.sh; no untrusted data is written to files or external systems.",
  "flows": "The domain input flows through get_parent_domains to generate domains, which then flow into query_crtsh to fetch data; results are aggregated in query_crtsh_multi.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard DNS domain processing and network querying with proper exception handling. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The use of sleep to rate-limit requests is normal. There are no backdoors or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard operations: generating parent domains, querying an external service (crt.sh) via HTTPS, handling responses and errors carefully, and rate-limiting requests. It does not include any malicious or suspicious code elements such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious injections. The code's logic appears benign, focusing solely on retrieving publicly available certificate data. There is no evidence of data leakage or malicious behavior. The only minor concern could be network-related exceptions, which are properly caught and logged, not exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe utility for querying crt.sh for certificate data related to a domain and its parent domains. It contains no malicious or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic. It demonstrates good error handling and rate limiting practices. Overall, it appears secure and benign.",
