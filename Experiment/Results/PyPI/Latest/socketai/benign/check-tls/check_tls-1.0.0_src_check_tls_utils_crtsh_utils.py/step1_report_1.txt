{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to query crt.sh for certificate information related to a given domain and its parent domains, to facilitate domain security analysis.",
  "sources": "Input domain parameter in get_parent_domains() and query_crtsh_multi(); network request to https://crt.sh/ in query_crtsh().",
  "sinks": "Network connection via urllib.request.urlopen(), reading JSON response, and logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Domain input -> get_parent_domains() -> query_crtsh() -> network request -> JSON parsing -> data processing and logging.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious variables detected. Use of sleep to rate-limit requests is benign. No data exfiltration or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a domain input, generates parent domains, and queries crt.sh via HTTP GET requests. It handles errors and logs issues appropriately. There are no signs of malicious code such as hidden network communications, data leaks, or code injection. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic suggests benign behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The sleep delay appears to be a rate limiter, not malicious. The error handling is comprehensive, with no suspicious exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for querying crt.sh for certificate data related to a domain and its parent domains. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, and its security risk is minimal.",
