  "purpose": "Query crt.sh for SSL certificate data related to a domain and its parent domains.",
  "sources": "The domain input, the get_parent_domains function generating domain variants, and the URL request to crt.sh.",
  "sinks": "The network request to crt.sh and JSON parsing, which could potentially leak data if crt.sh were malicious, but in this context, it is benign.",
  "flows": "Input domain -> generate parent domains -> query crt.sh for each domain -> parse JSON response.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with proper error handling and rate limiting.",
  "analysis": "The code performs domain parsing, constructs HTTPS requests to crt.sh, handles responses and errors appropriately, and deduplicates certificates. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The network activity is standard for such a utility. The error handling and rate limiting are correct. The code's purpose is benign, and no suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility for querying crt.sh for certificate data. It handles errors properly, uses rate limiting, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. The overall security risk score can be confidently set at 0.1, reflecting the minimal external dependency and network activity, but no malicious intent.",
