{
  "purpose": "Collects system metadata including OS info, hostname, environment, container and Kubernetes details, network interfaces, and machine ID.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (USER, USERNAME, ENVIRONMENT, POD_NAME, POD_NAMESPACE, NODE_NAME, POD_IP), files (/etc/machine-id, /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/*, /proc/1/cgroup), socket.gethostname(), os.getenv, os.path.exists",
  "sinks": "Reading files (machine ID, Kubernetes namespace, container info), environment variables (POD_NAME, POD_NAMESPACE, NODE_NAME, POD_IP), network interface info, machine ID generation",
  "flows": "Environment variables and files feed into Kubernetes detection, machine ID, and network info; system info collection gathers data from platform and environment variables",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for Kubernetes info and machine identification; fallback to UUID generation; access to container and system files; no suspicious code injecting or data exfiltration observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily gathers system information and container/Kubernetes metadata. It uses environment variables and file reads to determine environment context. The functions are straightforward and focus on data collection with exception handling. No data is transmitted externally, no hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, and no suspicious network activity are present. The code appears benign, targeting system and container environment detection and info gathering. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign system information collector with Kubernetes and container awareness. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It may be part of an inventory or monitoring system. No security risks are evident beyond standard system info gathering.",
