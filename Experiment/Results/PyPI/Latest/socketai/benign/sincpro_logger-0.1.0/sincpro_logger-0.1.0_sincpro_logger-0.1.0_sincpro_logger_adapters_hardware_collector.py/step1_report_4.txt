{
  "purpose": "Collects system metadata including hardware and environment information, particularly for monitoring or auditing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., USER, ENVIRONMENT, POD_NAME, POD_NAMESPACE, POD_IP, HOSTNAME), file system (e.g., /etc/machine-id, /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io, /proc/1/cgroup), and system commands (platform, socket, os, sys).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data leading to data exfiltration, code execution, or malicious activity are present. No network communication or data exfiltration mechanisms are observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and file contents (e.g., Kubernetes info, machine ID) are read to generate system metadata. These are used internally for reporting; no data flows towards external malicious endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Use of standard system and environment data collection is typical; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The only potential concern is reliance on environment variables and files that could be manipulated in compromised environments, but this is standard for system info gathering.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system info collection such as OS details, hostname, environment variables, Kubernetes pod info, and machine identifiers. It safely handles exceptions, defaults to safe values, and uses standard methods to gather data. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The code does not perform any network activity or contain logic that could be exploited for malicious purposes. It is typical system metadata collection code with proper exception handling and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate system info collection without malicious intent. It gathers environment and system details safely and responsibly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this module.",
