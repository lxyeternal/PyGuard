{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect hardware information and send it to a specified Discord webhook for monitoring or reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads system, CPU, memory, disk, and network information from the 'hardware_info' object passed to the 'send_hardware_info' method.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the 'requests.post' call that sends a JSON payload containing the hardware info to the Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'hardware_info' object through formatting functions, then into the payload sent via the HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL is hardcoded and publicly visible in the source code, which can be a security concern. No user input or untrusted data is processed or utilized in insecure ways. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely formats hardware information into strings and transmits it via a standard HTTP request to a fixed Discord webhook URL. No dynamic code execution, external untrusted input, or potentially malicious operations are evident. The only concern is the hardcoded webhook URL, which, if exposed, could allow unauthorized messages or data exposure. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malware-like behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward hardware info sender using Discord webhooks with no malicious behavior. Its security risk is minimal, primarily due to the hardcoded webhook URL, which could be abused if compromised. No malware or obfuscated code is present.",
