  "purpose": "Send hardware information to a Discord webhook for monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Webhook URL hardcoded in __init__ method; hardware info passed as argument to send_hardware_info method.",
  "sinks": "requests.post method used to send data to Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Hardware info is formatted into strings and sent via HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets besides the webhook URL; no obfuscation; no unusual code patterns. The webhook URL is exposed in the code, which is a security concern but not malicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for formatting and sending hardware info to a specified Discord webhook. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which could be considered a security concern if this code were publicly accessible, but does not indicate malicious intent. The methods format system, CPU, memory, disk, and network info into strings and send them via HTTP POST requests. The request handling catches exceptions but does not log or report errors. No malicious actions like data exfiltration beyond sending info to a specified webhook are present. No suspicious behavior such as backdoors, data theft, or unauthorized system access is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a hardware monitoring notification tool sending data to a Discord webhook. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, but the exposure of the webhook URL poses a security risk if misused. Overall, the code appears benign, with no malicious intent detected.",
