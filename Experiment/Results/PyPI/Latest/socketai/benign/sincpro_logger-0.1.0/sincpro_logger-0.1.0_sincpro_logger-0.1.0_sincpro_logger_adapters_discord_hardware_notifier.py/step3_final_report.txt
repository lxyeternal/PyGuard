  "purpose": "Send formatted hardware information to a Discord webhook for monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "HardwareInfo object properties: system_info, cpu_info, memory_info, disk_info, network_interfaces",
  "sinks": "requests.post to the hardcoded webhook URL",
  "flows": "HardwareInfo data -> formatting functions -> payload -> requests.post to webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL in __init__, no input validation or dynamic URL handling",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it formats hardware info into strings and sends them via a POST request to a fixed Discord webhook URL. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is present. The main security concern is the hardcoded webhook URL, which could be exploited if exposed publicly. The functions are simple and correctly implemented, with exception handling in _send_message. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3) due to the exposed URL. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's purpose is benign, serving as a reporting tool, with the primary concern being the security of the webhook URL.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions as intended for hardware info reporting. The main security issue is the hardcoded webhook URL, which should be externalized or secured. No malware or obfuscation is present. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a risk score around 0.2-0.3 due to URL exposure.",
