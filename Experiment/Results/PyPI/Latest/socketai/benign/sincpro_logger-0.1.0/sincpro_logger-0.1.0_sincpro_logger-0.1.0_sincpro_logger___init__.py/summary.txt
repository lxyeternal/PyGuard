  "conclusion": "All reports accurately reflect the absence of malicious or obfuscated code, with appropriate low risk scores and zero malware likelihood. Minor adjustments could be made to confidence levels for reports with no code, setting them to near zero, and risk scores to zero to reflect the lack of evidence. Overall, the security posture appears sound, and no malicious activity is indicated."
