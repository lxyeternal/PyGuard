  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Content:** No code provided, only a high-level description.  \n- **Assessment:** Since no code is available, we cannot confirm the presence of issues. The conclusion that no malicious behavior can be identified is appropriate.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable given the lack of code.  \n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Content:** Describes a general utility or demonstration script, no suspicious patterns or code snippets.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; with no code, no malicious activity can be detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Content:** Again, a high-level description of a utility function with no code snippets.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code appears benign.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem justified.  \n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Content:** No code provided, only a description of the absence of code.  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes that no analysis can be performed.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are acceptable.  \n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Content:** No code available, only notes on absence.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; no code means no security issues can be assessed.  \n- **Scores:** All zeros are appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall observations:\n- All reports correctly acknowledge the absence of code, limiting analysis.\n- The risk scores are low (0.2) where some minimal risk is assigned, which is acceptable given the lack of code.\n- Malware scores are all zero, consistent with no suspicious code present.\n- Obfuscated scores are zero, as no code is provided.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the reports' content.\n- No adjustments needed based on the information provided.\n\n### Personal estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detectable without code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, due to lack of code and context)\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate given the absence of code snippets. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
