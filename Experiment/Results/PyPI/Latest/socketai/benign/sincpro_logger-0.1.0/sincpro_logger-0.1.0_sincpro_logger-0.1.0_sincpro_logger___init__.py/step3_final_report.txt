  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source dependency based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points, such as environment variables, user inputs, network calls, or file reads within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or execution points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Paths from sources to sinks that could lead to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, unusual code constructs, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are absent; all reports correctly identify the lack of code, limiting analysis. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 or 0) are appropriate given the context. Confidence levels are generally high when benign code is described, but should be lower or zero when no code exists. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected or implied. The assessments are consistent and cautious, reflecting the limited information.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately reflect the absence of malicious or obfuscated code, with appropriate low risk scores and zero malware likelihood. Minor adjustments could be made to confidence levels for reports with no code, setting them to near zero, and risk scores to zero to reflect the lack of evidence. Overall, the security posture appears sound, and no malicious activity is indicated.",
