{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for collecting and representing hardware and network interface information.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; class attributes initialized internally or by subclasses.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only data structure definitions and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is purely structural, defining classes and methods.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of dataclass definitions for network and hardware info, along with an abstract collector interface. There are no input/output operations, network connections, or data processing logic. The collect() method is a placeholder meant for subclass implementation, with no code that executes or manipulates data. The code appears to be standard and intended for hardware info collection; no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical data structure and interface definition for hardware information collection. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
