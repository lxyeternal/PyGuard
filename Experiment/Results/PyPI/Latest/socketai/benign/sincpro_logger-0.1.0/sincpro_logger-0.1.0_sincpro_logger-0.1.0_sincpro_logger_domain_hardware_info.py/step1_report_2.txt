  "purpose": "Define data structures and interface for collecting hardware information from a system.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; class definitions and method signatures suggest data collection from system APIs or modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication, logging, or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code is purely structural with no implementation or data handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, using standard Python constructs with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for network and hardware info, and an interface class for hardware collection. All constructs are standard and commonly used for system information gathering. No dynamic execution, external communication, or malicious patterns observed. The purpose appears to be to organize hardware data collection in a modular way. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard and benign interface and data structure setup for hardware info collection. No malicious intent or security issues detected.",
