  "purpose": "Define data structures and an interface for hardware information collection.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow occurs in this static code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, purely structural, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for network and hardware info, and an abstract collector interface with an unimplemented 'collect' method. It contains no executable logic, input/output, network activity, or data manipulation. The code is standard, benign, and intended as a base for subclass implementation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned by reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structural setup for hardware info collection with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.",
