  "purpose": "Define data structures for collecting hardware and network interface information, and an interface for hardware data collection.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows to untrusted sinks or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and an interface.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Python data classes describing network interfaces and hardware info, along with an abstract interface class for hardware collection. There are no functions executing untrusted data, no external input handling, and no code that interacts with external systems or performs network or file operations. The structure is standard for a hardware information collection module. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign definition of data structures and an interface for hardware data collection with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
