  "purpose": "Define data structures for collecting and representing hardware information and network interfaces.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only class definitions and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing functions; no data flow mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows; code only declares data models and an interface.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward data structure definitions with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of dataclass definitions for NetworkInterface and HardwareInfo, which structure system hardware data, and an abstract class HardwareCollector with a collect method intended for implementation. There are no inputs, outputs, or runtime behaviors that could be exploited. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code snippets. The design appears to be for system information collection in a typical, benign manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines data structures and an interface for hardware info collection without any actual data processing, external communication, or suspicious behavior. It appears benign and unrelated to malicious activity.",
