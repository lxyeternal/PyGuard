  "purpose": "Define data structures and an interface for collecting hardware information.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; class and method definitions do not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; no data processing or transmission occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as the code only defines data models and an interface with a method placeholder.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code; code is purely structural.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data class definitions representing hardware info and network interfaces, along with an abstract class for collecting hardware data. It contains no executable logic, external input handling, or data transmission. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks are apparent. The placeholder 'collect' method indicates expected implementation but does not contain any malicious code or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining data models and an interface for hardware info collection. It presents no security risks or malicious intent. It appears to be part of a larger system that would implement the 'collect' method. Overall, the code is safe.",
