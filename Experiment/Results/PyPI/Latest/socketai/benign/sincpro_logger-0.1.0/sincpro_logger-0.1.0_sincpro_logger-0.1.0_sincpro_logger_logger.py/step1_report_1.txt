  "purpose": "Provide logging functionalities with configurable levels and proxy logger instances for an application.",
  "sources": "Configuration functions (configure_global_logging), logger creation (create_logger), and LoggerProxy methods (bind, unbind, properties).",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or transmits untrusted data; it mainly sets up logging infrastructure.",
  "flows": "Configuration functions set logging level and format; create_logger initializes LoggerProxy; LoggerProxy methods provide bound logging functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or system manipulation. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging framework with configurable levels, creating logger proxies that facilitate logging with context binding. The configuration involves setting up structured or console rendering based on levels. The create_logger function initializes loggers, calling pre_init_logger(), likely for setup. No user input handling, external data parsing, or network activity observed. No indicators of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or secret leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely configures and creates loggers, and uses established libraries properly. No malicious or suspicious elements identified.",
