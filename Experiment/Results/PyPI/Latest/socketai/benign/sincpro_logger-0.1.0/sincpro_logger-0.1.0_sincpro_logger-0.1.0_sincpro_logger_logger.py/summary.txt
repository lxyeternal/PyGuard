  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The external dependency 'pre_init_logger()' is a potential vector but cannot be evaluated here; its presence does not alter the benign assessment. The malware score remains 0, and the overall security risk is minimal. The provided reports are accurate and appropriate."
