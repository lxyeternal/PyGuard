      "conclusion": "All reports accurately reflect the absence of malicious or obfuscated code, with appropriate low risk scores and zero malware likelihood. Minor adjustments could be made to confidence levels for reports with no code, setting them to near zero, and risk scores to zero to reflect the lack of evidence. Overall, the security posture appears sound, and no malicious activity is indicated."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The external dependency 'pre_init_logger()' is a potential vector but cannot be evaluated here; its presence does not alter the benign assessment. The malware score remains 0, and the overall security risk is minimal. The provided reports are accurate and appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign hardware info collection and notification routine with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk stems from privacy considerations rather than malicious activity. External modules' trustworthiness should be verified separately, but based on this snippet alone, the code is safe."

It does not perform any malicious actions, exfiltrate data, or contain obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is correctly set to 0. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified."

No malware or obfuscation is present. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a risk score around 0.2-0.3 due to URL exposure."
