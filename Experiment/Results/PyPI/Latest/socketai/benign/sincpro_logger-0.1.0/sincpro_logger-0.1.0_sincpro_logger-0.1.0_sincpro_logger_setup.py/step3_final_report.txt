  "purpose": "Collect hardware information and send it via Discord notification.",

  "sinks": "notifier.send_hardware_info()",
  "flows": "hardware info collected from hardware_collector and transmitted through Discord notifier",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data collection and transmission",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for hardware data collection and notification, creates instances of these classes, and sends hardware info over the network. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. External modules' internal behaviors are unknown, but based on their names, they appear to perform standard hardware collection and notification tasks. The data flow is simple and typical for system monitoring tools. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The transmission of hardware info over Discord raises privacy considerations but does not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to privacy implications. The confidence level is high, given the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign hardware info collection and notification routine with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk stems from privacy considerations rather than malicious activity. External modules' trustworthiness should be verified separately, but based on this snippet alone, the code is safe.",
