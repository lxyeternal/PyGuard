  "flows": "hardware_info obtained from hardware_collector and passed to notifier.send_hardware_info()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious URLs, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports hardware collection and Discord notification modules. It initializes a hardware collector object, retrieves hardware info, then creates a Discord notifier object to send this info. The process appears straightforward and intended for monitoring or inventory purposes. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors are evident. The code relies on external modules, but their internal behaviors cannot be assessed from this snippet. Overall, it seems to be a benign hardware info collection routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs hardware information collection and notification via Discord in a typical manner. No malicious activity or suspicious patterns are detected based on the provided snippet.",
