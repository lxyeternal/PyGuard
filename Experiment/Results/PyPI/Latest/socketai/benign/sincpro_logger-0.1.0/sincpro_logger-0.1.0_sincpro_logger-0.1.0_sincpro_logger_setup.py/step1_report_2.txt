  "purpose": "Collect hardware information and send it via Discord notifier.",
  "sources": "get_hardware_collector() and hardware_collector.collect() for hardware data, instantiated DiscordHardwareNotifier for sending data",
  "sinks": "notifier.send_hardware_info() potentially sending collected data over the network",
  "flows": "Hardware info collected from hardware_collector.collect() flows to notifier.send_hardware_info() which transmits it",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions. Use of standard library and class methods appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a hardware collector object, collects hardware info, then uses a Discord notifier to send this info. No external inputs, environment variables, or user inputs are directly used. The flow involves gathering system data and transmitting it via a Discord message, which could be a privacy concern but not inherently malicious. No signs of backdoors, data theft, or malicious payloads. The code appears to perform legitimate hardware info reporting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended to gather and send hardware information through Discord. No malicious behavior or malware signs are evident. The main concern is privacy, not security breach. The code itself appears safe but should be reviewed in context of the broader application for privacy policies.",
