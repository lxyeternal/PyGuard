  "purpose": "Collect hardware information and send it via Discord notification.",
  "sources": "get_hardware_collector() and hardware_collector.collect() functions.",
  "sinks": "notifier.send_hardware_info(hardware_info) which potentially transmits data over the network.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from hardware via get_hardware_collector() and collected by collect(), then passed to send_hardware_info() for transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, and no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes hardware data collection through a modular approach, calling external functions to gather hardware info. It then uses a notifier class to send this info over a network, likely via Discord. The code relies on external modules; without their implementation details, we cannot assess whether sensitive data is being captured or transmitted maliciously. No unusual behaviors, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident in this snippet. The data flow appears straightforward and typical for hardware monitoring systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs hardware data collection and notification. Based solely on this snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent. However, without inspecting the external modules, we cannot fully confirm the security implications, though there is no immediate evidence of malicious behavior.",
