  "purpose": "Collect hardware information and send it via Discord notification",
  "sources": "get_hardware_collector() and hardware_collector.collect() functions",
  "sinks": "notifier.send_hardware_info() function",
  "flows": "get_hardware_collector() -> hardware_collector.collect() -> notifier.send_hardware_info()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns; functions called are from external modules that appear to handle hardware info collection and notification",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules related to hardware collection and Discord notification. It defines a function that initializes hardware collection, retrieves hardware info, and sends this info via a Discord notifier. No data is read from untrusted sources within this snippet, nor does it show evidence of data leakage, malicious code, or backdoors. The purpose appears to be legitimate hardware monitoring and notification. Without additional context on external modules, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform hardware information collection and notification without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not include hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity within this fragment.",
