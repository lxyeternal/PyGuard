{
  "purpose": "The code performs a relative import of the 'hello' function or object from the 'main' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which reads the 'main' module relative to the current package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external interactions; the code does not process input or output data directly.",
  "flows": "The import source ('from .main import hello') is static; there are no data flows or dynamic data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal relative import statement, which is standard in Python packages. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The import is static and predictable, with no hardcoded secrets or external dependencies that could be exploited. The security risk and malware scores should be zero, reflecting the benign nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores for malware and obfuscation are appropriate at 0. The security risk score should also be 0, as there is no evidence of malicious or risky behavior. Minor adjustments to the existing reports involve setting the security risk to 0 where it was previously slightly above zero.",
