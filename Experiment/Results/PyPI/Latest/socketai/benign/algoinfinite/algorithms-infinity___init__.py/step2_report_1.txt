  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims and scores:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious activity. The confidence is high (1), and all scores (obfuscated, malware, securityRisk) are 0.\n   - **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the reasoning is sound. The code is a straightforward relative import, with no suspicious behavior. Scores are consistent.\n   - **Verdict:** Appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Assessment:** Again, the code is just an import statement. The only point is the securityRisk score of 0.1, which is slightly above zero.\n   - **Justification for securityRisk=0.1:** Given the minimal code and no evidence of malicious intent, assigning a low security risk might be cautious but not justified unless there's context suggesting potential issues (e.g., the package source is untrusted). Since the report claims no suspicious behavior, a securityRisk of 0.1 seems slightly high.\n   - **Recommendation:** Reduce securityRisk to 0 unless there's additional context. Scores for malware and obfuscated remain at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that.\n   - **Note:** The securityRisk is 0.1, again slightly above zero.\n   - **Recommendation:** Given the lack of suspicious activity, consider lowering securityRisk to 0 for consistency.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Assessment:** Similar to others, but the confidence is slightly lower (0.9). The report correctly states the benign nature.\n   - **Malware score:** 0, which is correct.\n   - **Obfuscated:** 0, correct.\n   - **SecurityRisk:** 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n   - **Score of 0.9 confidence:** Slightly less than perfect but acceptable given the minimal code.\n   - **Verdict:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Recommendations:\n- All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The **securityRisk** scores of 0.1 in reports 3 and 4 seem unjustified given the benign nature of the code. I recommend lowering these to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n### Final Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** Since the code is benign, overall risk should be minimal, so I suggest a risk score of **0** for all.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The scores reflect this, except for the minor securityRisk points in some reports, which should be adjusted to zero.\n\n**Final note:** Without additional context or code, the risk remains negligible. The minimal nature of the code strongly indicates no malicious intent.",
