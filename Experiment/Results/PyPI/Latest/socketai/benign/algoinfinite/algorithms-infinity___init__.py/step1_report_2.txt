  "purpose": "Import the 'hello' function or object from the local 'main' module, likely part of a larger package or application.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'hello' from a relative module './main'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or data processing in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A – No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present in this minimal import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only performing a relative import without any suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious indicators are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward relative import from a module named 'main'. It does not include any logic, data handling, or dynamic code execution. Since it is just an import statement, it does not pose any security risk or malicious behavior by itself. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is part of normal Python module usage, with no anomalies or suspicious elements.",
