  "anomalies": "Minimal code with a simple import statement; no unusual language features, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import of 'hello' from a module named 'main'. It contains no runtime input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no visible malicious behavior. As it is a minimal import statement, it does not exhibit signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. There are no anomalies or suspicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward import statement with no malicious or security concerns detected. It is typical and benign.",
