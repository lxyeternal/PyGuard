  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only a static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no suspicious or unusual constructs are present. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement, importing 'hello' from the 'main' module. It does not include any data handling, network communication, or executable logic. The minimal nature of this code reduces the likelihood of malicious intent or malicious behavior. Without additional context or code, no malicious activity or security risks can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard Python import, and there are no indications of malware or security issues based solely on this fragment.",
