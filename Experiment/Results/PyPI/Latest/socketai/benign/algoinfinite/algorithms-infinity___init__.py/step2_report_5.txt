  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their accuracy, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple relative import statement: `from .main import hello`.\n- The code is minimal, static, and involves no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippet in all reports matches the original code exactly.\n- No issues are present in the code itself; it is a straightforward import statement.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical errors are present in the reports; all correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- The reasoning that this is a standard import with no malicious intent is sound.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n- **Security risk score:** Most reports assign 0, with one report assigning 0.1. Given the code's nature, a 0.1 risk score is slightly overestimating, unless considering the possibility of future malicious code, which isn't evident here.\n\n### Specific issues:\n- The report with `\"securityRisk\": 0.1` (report 3) slightly overstates the risk for such a benign import statement. A score of 0 or 0.05 would be more appropriate.\n- The rest are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate; 0.05 at most if considering minimal inherent risk.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (to account for the minimal inherent risk in code inclusion, but effectively negligible)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet. The scores assigned are mostly appropriate, with a slight overestimation of risk in one report. I recommend maintaining a malware and obfuscated score of 0 and a very low risk score (around 0.05) for this import statement.\n\n**Final note:** The import statement itself is harmless; any security concern would depend on the contents of the `main` module, which isn't provided here.",
