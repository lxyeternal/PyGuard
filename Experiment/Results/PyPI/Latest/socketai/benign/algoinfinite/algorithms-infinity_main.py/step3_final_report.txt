  "sinks": "String formatting operation embedding 'name' into the return string.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' flows directly into the formatted string in the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious code structures detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic function with no external dependencies, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution. The input is directly embedded into a string, which is safe. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify the scores. The assessments are consistent and accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports' evaluations and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
