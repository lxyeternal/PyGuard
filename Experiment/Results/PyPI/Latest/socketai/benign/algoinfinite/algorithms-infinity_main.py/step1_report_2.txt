  "purpose": "Function to return a greeting message with a provided name.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'name' which is a string that can be supplied externally.",
  "sinks": "The string formatting operation that embeds 'name' into the return message.",
  "flows": "The 'name' input flows into the f-string formatting, which outputs the greeting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that returns a greeting. The input 'name' has a default value and can be supplied externally, but there are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection or data exfiltration. The function operates solely on string formatting without any network calls, environment variable use, or file operations. The structure and logic are straightforward and typical for such functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign greeting function with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
