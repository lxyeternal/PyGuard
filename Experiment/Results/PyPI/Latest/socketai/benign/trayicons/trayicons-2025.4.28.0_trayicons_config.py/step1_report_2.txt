{
  "purpose": "The code loads and processes icon configuration data from a TOML file, validating file paths, and preparing icon source-destination mappings.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from a TOML configuration file specified via command-line arguments or default filename, and from the filesystem when checking file existence.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data leading to security impacts are present. The code only reads files and performs local path operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the TOML configuration file into IconConfig objects, with path resolution and validation, and then stored in a Config object.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed. The code handles file paths carefully, resolves them to absolute paths, and performs existence checks. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward configuration loader that reads a TOML file, validates file paths, and stores icon configurations. It uses standard libraries and practices, with appropriate error handling for missing files and parsing errors. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling is present. The code does not include any suspicious logic or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration loader with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It responsibly handles file paths and input data without performing harmful actions.",
