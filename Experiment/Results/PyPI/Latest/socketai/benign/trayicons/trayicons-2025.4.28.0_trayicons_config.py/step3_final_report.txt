{
  "purpose": "The code loads icon configuration data from a TOML file, resolving source and destination paths relative to the configuration file, performing existence checks, and handling command-line arguments to specify the config file.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (--config, positional config_file), and loads the TOML file specified by the user.",
  "sinks": "Path resolution using Path().resolve(), existence checks on source files, and printing error/warning messages.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> path resolution -> file reading -> path validation -> IconConfig object creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. No dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard configuration loading with path resolution and validation. It uses safe practices such as resolving paths and checking for file existence. Error handling is via print statements and exit calls, typical for CLI tools. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The code's logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to correct path handling and input validation, which are adequately addressed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward configuration loader with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
