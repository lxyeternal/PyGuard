{
  "purpose": "This script loads icon configuration data from a TOML file, validates file paths, and constructs internal data structures for further processing.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the specified TOML configuration file and input command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses file paths derived from the TOML data to resolve and check existence; no data sinks for untrusted data are evident.",
  "flows": "Input command-line arguments determine the configuration file path, which is then read; icon data with 'src' and 'dst' are processed and paths are resolved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns observed. The code performs standard file path validation, and there are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated elements. No network activity, code injection, or privacy violations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration data from a TOML file, resolves file paths, and performs existence checks. It uses standard libraries and techniques for file handling and command-line parsing. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The only minor concern is the use of 'exit(-1)' without cleanup or detailed error reporting, but this is a typical pattern for command-line utilities and does not suggest malicious intent. The code is straightforward and adheres to common practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration loader with no indications of malicious or maliciously sabotaged behavior. It securely loads and processes configuration data with proper validation and error handling. No malware or security risks are identified.",
