{
  "purpose": "This code loads and parses a TOML configuration file to manage icon file paths and destinations for some application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the file specified by the --config or positional argument, or defaults to 'icons.toml' in the current directory.",
  "sinks": "The code performs file system operations such as path resolution and existence checks; no direct data sinks are apparent. It prints warnings and errors to the console but does not send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input source is the configuration file path; flows include reading and parsing this file, resolving file paths, and constructing IconConfig objects. No untrusted data is used beyond file I/O.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs path resolution and existence checks without sanitizing input paths, but this is standard for configuration loading. It uses exit(-1) on errors, which is typical but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a configuration file, processes icon paths, and resolves them relative to the config file location. It handles missing files, decoding errors, and incomplete entries with warning messages. No suspicious code, obfuscated patterns, or malicious behaviors such as network activity, credential handling, or backdoors are present. The use of print statements and exit calls for error handling is typical for CLI tools. Overall, the code appears to be a standard configuration loader with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration parser for icon management, with no indications of malicious or maliciously sabotaged behavior. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond standard path handling and file I/O. The security risk score is very low.",
