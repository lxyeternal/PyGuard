{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to run the main() function from the main module when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code simply calls main() when executed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the main function from a relative module and executes it if the script is run directly. It does not contain any hardcoded credentials, malicious functions, or obfuscated code. The structure is typical for Python scripts meant to run a main entry point. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard script entry point with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs a simple main() invocation with no suspicious behavior.",
