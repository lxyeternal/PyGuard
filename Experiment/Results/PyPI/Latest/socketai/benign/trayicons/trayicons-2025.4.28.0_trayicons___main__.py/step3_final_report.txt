  "purpose": "Minimal Python entry point that imports and executes main() from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main, execution of main() in __main__ block",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; potential risks depend on main() implementation",
  "flows": "Import from .main -> call main() when script runs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward and standard structure",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python script that imports main from a local module and executes it if run directly. No external data, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of main(), which is not provided. The code itself shows no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The minimal nature suggests a benign purpose, with scores reflecting very low risk and malware potential. Given the absence of suspicious features, the overall assessment is that this code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score (around 0.1) to account for unknown behavior of main().",
