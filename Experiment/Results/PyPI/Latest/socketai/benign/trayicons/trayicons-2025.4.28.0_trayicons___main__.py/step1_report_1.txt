{
  "purpose": "This code is a simple entry point that imports and executes the main function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'main' and calls its 'main()' function when executed as a script.",
  "sinks": "The main() function is invoked, but its internal behavior is unknown from this snippet. No direct untrusted data handling or system effect is visible.",
  "flows": "The script flow is: import 'main' -> execute main() if script is run directly. No external data flows are evident here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script serves as an entry point that runs the main() function from a local module. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity in this fragment. Since the main() function's implementation is not shown, potential risks depend entirely on its contents, which are outside this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard minimal entry point for a Python application. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks on its own. The overall security depends on the implementation of the imported main() function, but based solely on this snippet, no issues are evident.",
