{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point that imports and executes the main function from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'main' and calls its 'main' function if the script is executed directly.",
  "sinks": "The code calls the 'main' function, which may contain additional logic; no direct sink present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' module → execution of 'main()' if __name__ == '__main__' condition is true.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python entry point pattern. It imports a local module 'main' and executes its main function when run directly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hardcoded secrets, within this fragment. Since the actual behavior depends on the imported 'main' module, but no suspicious activity is evident here, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical entry point with no indications of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
