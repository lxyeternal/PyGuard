{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple entry point script that imports and runs the main function from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data directly; it imports a function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform any potentially dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the script only invokes a function imported from the local module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual language features, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the main function from a local module named '.main'. When executed as a script, it calls main(). There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. It is a standard Python entry point pattern. The code does not include any hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or other malicious indicators. Without inspecting the 'main' function itself, there is no evidence of malicious intent in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python script used as an entry point for a larger application. It contains no malicious or suspicious code. Based solely on this fragment, there is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
