  "purpose": "Analysis of supply chain security risks in the provided Python code, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security threats.",
  "sources": "Input data reads, environment variables, network activity, dynamic code execution points such as eval()/exec(), hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, potential data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution functions.",
  "flows": "Input data -> processing functions -> eval()/exec() or network transmission points; hardcoded secrets -> usage in code; obfuscated variables -> control flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, high obfuscation, convoluted control flow, suspicious data flows indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical patterns of malicious obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and secret leakage. No suspicious patterns are observed in benign samples. High confidence is placed on the suspicious patterns in report 5, with scores reflecting significant malicious potential. No code in reports 2 and 3 results in zero scores. Benign code in report 4 shows no anomalies. The scores are consistent with the detailed descriptions and observed behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms high malicious risk and obfuscation in report 5, with scores appropriately reflecting the suspicious patterns. Other reports with no code or benign code are correctly scored as low or zero risk. The overall assessment aligns with the provided evidence and analysis.",
