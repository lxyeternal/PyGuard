  "purpose": "A CLI tool for creating and initializing a new project by copying template data and executing setup commands.",
  "sources": "Reads static commands within subprocess.run calls; reads project_path argument as a Path object.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing shell commands; potential for command injection if inputs were dynamic (not in this case).",
  "flows": "Static command strings passed to subprocess.run() with shell=True, executed in the specified project directory.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell=True with static commands; no dynamic input influences command execution; no secrets or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs project setup tasks by copying resource data and executing predefined commands. The subprocess calls use shell=True, which is generally discouraged, but since commands are hardcoded and not influenced by user input, the security risk is minimal. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. Error handling is appropriate. The overall structure is straightforward and intended for legitimate use.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign project scaffolding CLI with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The main concern is the use of shell=True, which is acceptable here due to static commands but should be avoided if commands become dynamic. The security risk is low, and the code is safe for use.",
