  "conclusion": "The script is a benign project scaffolding CLI with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The main concern is the use of shell=True, which is acceptable here due to static commands but should be avoided if commands become dynamic. The security risk is low, and the code is safe for use."
