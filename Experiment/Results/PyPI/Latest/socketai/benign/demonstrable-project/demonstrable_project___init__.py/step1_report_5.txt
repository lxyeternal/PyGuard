  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ string and splitting it into parts.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "None; the code only processes static data within the module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of map() without converting to list in Python 3, which results in a map object. No other unusual behavior or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and attempts to convert it into a list of integers using map(). However, in Python 3, map() returns an iterator, which may not be the intended structure. No external inputs, outputs, or suspicious logic detected. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with a minor issue in the use of map(). It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
