  "purpose": "Define the package version as a string and convert it into a list of integers for further processing.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ string, splitting it into components",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Splitting __version__ into parts and mapping to integers, with no data passed to external systems or stored insecurely",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, then attempts to create __version_info__ by mapping int over the split string. This is a standard way to parse version numbers into a list of integers. No external data input, no security-sensitive operations, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be a typical package version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply processes version information in a standard manner.",
