{
  "purpose": "Define the package version as a string and parse it into a list of integers for version comparison or other version-related logic.",
  "sources": "Read from the string '__version__' which is a hardcoded version number.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The string '__version__' is split and converted into integers, a straightforward operation with no external input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of map without converting to a list (in Python 3, map returns an iterator), which could be an oversight but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to '__version__' and then attempts to parse it into integers with 'map(int, __version__.split(\".\"))'. The use of 'map' without wrapping in 'list()' means '__version_info__' is an iterator, which might be unintended but is not malicious. There are no external inputs, no sensitive data handling, no obfuscated or suspicious code structures. Overall, the code simply initializes version information without any harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, serving a typical purpose of version parsing. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
