  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\n__version__ = \"0.1.0\"\n__version_info__ = map(int, __version__.split(\".\"))\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues Reported:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code assigns a version string and attempts to parse it into integers.\n- The key concern across reports is that `map()` is used without wrapping in `list()`, resulting in a `map` object in Python 3, which might be unintended but is not malicious.\n\n**Are there any actual security issues or malicious behaviors?**\n- No. The code is straightforward, with no external inputs, no data leaks, no code injection, and no obfuscated or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws and Logical Errors:\n- The only flaw noted is the use of `map()` without `list()`. This can cause issues if `__version_info__` is used multiple times, as `map()` objects are iterators that can be exhausted.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All reports are consistent in identifying this minor issue.\n- No report suggests any malicious intent or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. Correct, since there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0, no security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since all reports and the code itself show no malicious intent, the scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The minor issue with `map()` can be fixed by wrapping it with `list()`, e.g.,:\n  ```python\n  __version_info__ = list(map(int, __version__.split(\".\")))\n  ```\n- But this is a code correctness issue, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, standard version parsing, with a minor Python 3 compatibility note.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks. The only concern is the minor potential bug related to `map()` returning an iterator, which is not security-related. Therefore, the scores should remain at zero across all categories.",
