  "purpose": "Parse the version string into a sequence of integers for version comparison or processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string assigned to __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "The code splits __version__ and maps each part to int, assigning to __version_info__.",
  "anomalies": "Uses map() without wrapping in list(), resulting in a map object (iterator) instead of a list, which may be unintended but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and attempts to parse it into integers. The main issue is that map() returns an iterator in Python 3, which may cause issues if later code expects a list. No external inputs, outputs, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and benign. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected. The minor oversight with map() is a common coding mistake but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version parsing snippet with a minor, non-security-related issue regarding the use of map(). There is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score should be 0.",
