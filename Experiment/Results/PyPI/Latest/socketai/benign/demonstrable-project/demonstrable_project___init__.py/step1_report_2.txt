  "flows": "Parsing version string into list of integers",
  "anomalies": "Use of map without converting to list (in Python 3, map returns an iterator, which may be unintended)",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__ and attempts to create a list of integers __version_info__ by splitting and mapping. The use of map() without wrapping in list() means __version_info__ is a map object, not a list, which could lead to issues if iterated multiple times. No malicious behavior or security issues are present. The code is simple and standard for version handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign version assignment with a minor issue regarding the use of map(). It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
