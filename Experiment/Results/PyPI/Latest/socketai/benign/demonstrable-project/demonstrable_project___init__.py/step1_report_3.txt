  "anomalies": "Use of map object without converting to list; no security anomalies or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__ and attempts to create __version_info__ by splitting the version string into parts and converting each to an integer using map. However, the result of map is a map object, not a list, which may cause issues if used directly later. No input/output, external data, or security-sensitive operations are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and safe. It defines version information without any malicious intent or security risks.",
