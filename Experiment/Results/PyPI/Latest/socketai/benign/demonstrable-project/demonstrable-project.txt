      "conclusion": "The script is a benign project scaffolding CLI with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The main concern is the use of shell=True, which is acceptable here due to static commands but should be avoided if commands become dynamic. The security risk is low, and the code is safe for use."

      "conclusion": "The code is a simple version parsing snippet with a minor, non-security-related issue regarding the use of map(). There is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score should be 0."

Other reports with no code or benign code are correctly scored as low or zero risk. The overall assessment aligns with the provided evidence and analysis."
