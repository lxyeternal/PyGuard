{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task, but the exact function is unclear due to the lack of comments and context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'input_data' variable and possibly from environment variables or external files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data processing functions, network communication functions, or file operations that could leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables into processing functions, potentially leading to unsafe operations if the data is not sanitized.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code were detected. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing standard libraries and defining functions, but contains no obfuscated or malicious constructs. It reads data from sources and processes it in a linear fashion, with no evidence of data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors. No suspicious behavior or risky patterns like dynamic code execution or hidden processes are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, and no malicious intent is detected.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
