  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network or file operations, dynamic execution points like eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, file modifications, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions, possibly leading to dynamic execution or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation, complex control flow, dynamic execution mechanisms, cryptic variable names, minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets generally appear benign with straightforward logic and no suspicious patterns. Report 3 shows signs of obfuscation and complex control flow, indicating potential dynamic execution or malicious intent, justifying higher suspicion scores. Other reports align with benign assessments, with scores reflecting minimal obfuscation and no malicious activity. The malware scores are appropriately low, with Report 3's suspicion acknowledged but not confirmed. Obfuscation scores are higher where signs are present, and security risks are aligned with suspicion levels. Overall, the scores are consistent with the code descriptions, with minor adjustments to better reflect suspicion levels in Report 3.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign; Report 3 exhibits signs of obfuscation and complex control flow, warranting cautious suspicion. Scores are generally appropriate; slight elevation of malware suspicion in Report 3 is justified but not definitive. Further manual review recommended for suspicious cases.",
