{
  "purpose": "The function executes a system command provided as input, potentially for remote code execution.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'command' passed to the rce() function.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executes the command, which can lead to code execution if untrusted input is supplied.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (command parameter) flows directly into os.system() without validation or sanitization, enabling execution of arbitrary commands.",
  "anomalies": "The function is a straightforward wrapper around os.system, which is inherently risky when handling external input. No validation, sanitization, or restrictions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that executes any given command string via os.system. There are no safeguards against malicious input, making it highly susceptible to command injection if used with untrusted data. The code is minimal and straightforward, but this simplicity highlights the risk: it allows arbitrary command execution with no control or validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is dangerous when used with untrusted input due to the direct execution of external commands. It presents a high security risk and could be exploited for malicious purposes such as remote code execution.",
