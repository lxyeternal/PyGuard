{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to execute system commands via the os.system call.",
  "sources": "The input 'command' parameter passed to the rce() function.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes the command, which could run arbitrary code on the system.",
  "flows": "Input received from function argument 'command' flows directly into os.system, leading to command execution.",
  "anomalies": "The function blindly executes any input command without validation, which is inherently risky. No input validation or sanitization is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function 'rce' that takes a command string and executes it using os.system. This provides a direct path for executing arbitrary system commands. Since the function accepts any input without restrictions, it can be exploited to run malicious commands. There are no safeguards, validation, or restrictions, making this an extremely dangerous pattern if exposed in production or untrusted contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code allows arbitrary command execution through the 'rce' function, representing a significant security risk if used with untrusted input. It could facilitate remote code execution or system compromise.",
