{
  "purpose": "Execute a shell command provided as input, allowing remote code execution if used improperly.",
  "sources": "The 'command' parameter passed to the 'rce' function, which can be any arbitrary string provided by the user or another part of the program.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call, which executes the input command in the shell environment.",
  "flows": "Input source ('command') flows directly into 'os.system', executing potentially untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'os.system' with f-string formatting directly on input is dangerous and can lead to arbitrary command execution. No input validation or sanitization is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'rce' that takes a command string as an argument. When invoked, it calls 'os.system' with the command string formatted via f-string. This allows any caller to execute arbitrary shell commands, which can be malicious if input is untrusted. The code does not sanitize or validate input, making it highly susceptible to command injection. The code is minimal but directly exposes a security vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is extremely dangerous as it permits arbitrary code execution through the 'rce' function, especially if 'command' comes from untrusted sources. This constitutes a critical security risk.",
