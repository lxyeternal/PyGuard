  "conclusion": "The code pattern enables untrusted input to be executed as a system command, representing a critical security vulnerability with high potential for malicious exploitation. The reports correctly identify this issue, and their scoring reflects the severity. To mitigate this risk, the code should be refactored to validate input, avoid direct execution, or use safer APIs such as 'subprocess.run' with argument lists. Overall, the analysis confirms the high security risk associated with this pattern."
