{
  "purpose": "Execute a system command passed as an argument, potentially for remote code execution or automation.",
  "sources": "The function parameter 'command' is the source of untrusted data that is executed directly.",
  "sinks": "os.system() is a sink that executes the command string, which can lead to code injection or remote command execution if 'command' is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input 'command' flows directly into os.system(), leading to execution of arbitrary commands.",
  "anomalies": "The function directly executes passed-in commands without validation or sanitization. No checks or restrictions are applied, which is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function 'rce' that takes a command string and executes it using os.system(). This pattern is inherently dangerous because it allows execution of arbitrary system commands. There are no input validations, sanitizations, or restrictions, making it susceptible to command injection if the 'command' parameter is controlled by an external or malicious source. The code’s simplicity and direct execution point indicate a potential for malicious use, especially if integrated into a larger application. No other obfuscation, indirect code, or additional logic is present to obscure intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code enables execution of arbitrary system commands, which is a significant security risk. If used with untrusted input, it could lead to remote code execution or system compromise. The code itself appears intentionally minimal but dangerous, with high potential for malicious behavior if misused.",
