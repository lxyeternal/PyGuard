{
  "purpose": "The function executes a shell command passed as input, potentially allowing remote code execution.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'command' passed to the rce() function, which can originate from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call, which executes the command string in the shell.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (command) flows directly into os.system(), leading to command execution.",
  "anomalies": "The function does not sanitize or validate the input; it directly executes whatever command is provided.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'rce' that takes a command string and executes it using os.system(). Since there are no input validations or restrictions, any untrusted input can lead to arbitrary command execution. This creates a high security risk if the function is used with untrusted data, as it could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands. The code is minimal but directly enables remote code execution if invoked with malicious input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly risky due to its potential for remote code execution. It allows execution of arbitrary shell commands supplied to the function, which is a critical security vulnerability. This pattern should be avoided or heavily secured to prevent abuse.",
