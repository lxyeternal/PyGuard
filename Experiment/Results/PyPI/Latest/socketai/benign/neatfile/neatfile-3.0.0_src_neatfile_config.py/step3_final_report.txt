  "purpose": "Manage application settings through a singleton pattern, supporting defaults, project-specific overrides, and CLI arguments with validation.",
  "sources": "Configuration files, environment variables, CLI arguments, internal validators",
  "sinks": "Validated settings stored in Dynaconf singleton, applied during application runtime",
  "flows": "Load configuration -> validate -> override with project/CLI settings -> store in singleton",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or malicious commands",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard configuration management pattern with robust validation, error handling, and override mechanisms. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. Validation functions enforce data integrity, and error handling safely terminates on invalid configurations. No obfuscation or network activity is present. The scoring aligns with the absence of malicious activity, with malware score at 0, obfuscation at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, well-structured configuration management module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are consistent and justified.",
