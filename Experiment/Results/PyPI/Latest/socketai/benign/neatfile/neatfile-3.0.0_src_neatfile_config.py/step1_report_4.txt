  "purpose": "Manage application configuration settings with default values, environment variables, project-specific overrides, and CLI arguments.",
  "sources": "Configuration files (settings_files), environment variables (envvar_prefix), CLI arguments (cli_settings argument), and potentially user-supplied project names.",
  "sinks": "The settings object and its validators, which may influence application behavior, file paths, or environment-dependent configurations.",
  "flows": "Settings are loaded from files/environment variables, validated, then potentially overridden by project-specific configurations or CLI inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. The code properly validates and handles errors. No evidence of obfuscated code or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a configuration management system using Dynaconf, registering multiple validators with default values and type casts. It handles loading configuration files, environment variables, and validates them. The methods allow applying project-specific settings and CLI overrides, with error handling to prevent misconfiguration. No suspicious code, network calls, or hidden behaviors identified. The use of external libraries appears standard and appropriate for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured configuration management module with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It validates inputs correctly and manages settings securely. No malicious behavior or malware detected.",
