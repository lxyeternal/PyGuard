{
  "purpose": "The code executes CLI commands to process files by cleaning, sorting, and committing changes based on user settings and confirmation prompts.",
  "sources": "find_processable_files, settings.files, settings.subcommand, settings.confirm_changes, settings.force, user input via Confirm.ask",
  "sinks": "commit_changes (writes changes), console.print (outputs confirmation table), raising cappa.Exit (terminates process), user confirmation input",
  "flows": "Input files from find_processable_files → processing functions (clean_filename, sort_file) → decision points based on changes and user confirmation → commit_changes for modified files → process exit",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns; reliance on external functions is typical but not suspicious; no unusual behaviors or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code reads input data from find_processable_files and settings, processes files with functions that likely modify them, and then either commits changes or exits based on user confirmation and settings. The use of external libraries and functions appears standard for a CLI file processing tool. No suspicious code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are evident. The flow strictly pertains to file operations and user interactions without network activity or system tampering.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical CLI file processing routine with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs user-confirmed file modifications and controlled exits without suspicious side effects.",
