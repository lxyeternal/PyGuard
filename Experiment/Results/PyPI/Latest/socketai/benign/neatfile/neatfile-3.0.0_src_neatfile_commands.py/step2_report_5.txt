  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Describes straightforward file processing with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis:** No malware, backdoors, or obfuscation; standard libraries; transparent flow.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score aligns with the report's conclusion. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on file management.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; straightforward logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the report; no malicious intent or malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Similar file processing with confirmation prompts.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis:** No network, data exfiltration, or malicious code; standard file handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns; aligns with the report's conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Same pattern—file processing with user confirmation.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; safe, standard CLI utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** No security issues; consistent with the report.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Similar, with detailed settings influencing behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code or network activity; standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity; aligns with the report.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Code Presence:** All reports describe code that is present and functional.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports consistently indicate no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, with scores ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable given the context.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** All reports are consistent, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is suggested.\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, justified by the benign nature of the code)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and thorough.\n- The code appears to be a standard CLI file management utility.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted based on the provided analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**I recommend setting the malware score to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the overall security risk to approximately 0.1–0.2.**  \nThese scores reflect the benign, transparent, and standard nature of the code as described across all reports.",
