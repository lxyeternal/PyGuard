  "purpose": "This script manages file processing commands such as cleaning, sorting, and committing changes, primarily for project files.",
  "sources": "find_processable_files, settings.files, user input via Confirm.ask",
  "sinks": "commit_changes (writes file modifications), console.print (displays confirmation table), cappa.Exit (exits process)",
  "flows": "find_processable_files → File constructor → clean_filename / sort_file → commit_changes, user confirmation via Confirm.ask → Exit",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. Use of standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code processes a list of files, applies cleaning and sorting based on user-defined commands, prompts for user confirmation if configured, and commits changes accordingly. It uses standard file handling and user interaction mechanisms. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors are present. The flow is transparent, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate file management tool without malicious intent. It performs typical file processing and user confirmation steps, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
