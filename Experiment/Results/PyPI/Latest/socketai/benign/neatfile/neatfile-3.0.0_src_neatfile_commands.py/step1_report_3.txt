  "purpose": "The code manages command-line operations to process files, including cleaning, sorting, and committing changes based on user confirmation and settings.",
  "sources": "Reads file paths from 'find_processable_files' and user input via 'Confirm.ask'.",
  "sinks": "Calls functions 'clean_filename', 'sort_file', and 'commit_changes' which may modify files or system state; outputs to console and logs.",
  "flows": "File paths and user confirmations flow from input functions to processing functions and final commits or exits.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of standard libraries and straightforward control flow.",
  "analysis": "The script processes files based on user settings, applying cleaning and sorting operations, then commits changes. It includes user confirmation before applying modifications. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration observed. The functions invoked are typical for file management. The code appears to be well-structured and standard in functionality with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate file processing tasks based on user interaction and settings. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this module.",
