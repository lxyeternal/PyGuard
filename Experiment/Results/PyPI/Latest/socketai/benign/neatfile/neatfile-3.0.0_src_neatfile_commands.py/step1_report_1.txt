{
  "purpose": "This script executes CLI commands to process files, including cleaning filenames, sorting files, and optionally applying changes after user confirmation.",
  "sources": "find_processable_files() to get files; settings (subcommand, confirm_changes, force); user input via Confirm.ask()",
  "sinks": "commit_changes() modifies files; console.print() displays confirmation table",
  "flows": "Input files from find_processable_files -> processed via clean_filename and sort_file -> changes tracked in file.has_changes -> user confirmation via Confirm.ask() -> commit_changes() applies changes",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of standard libraries and typical file processing functions. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads files to process using find_processable_files() and processes them based on the subcommand. It tracks changes via file.has_changes and prompts the user for confirmation before applying changes. The flow appears straightforward, involving no suspicious or malicious functions. The only external interactions are standard file processing and user prompts. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or sabotage observed. The usage of external libraries is typical and does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI file processing script with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It responsibly prompts users for confirmation before applying changes and handles files systematically. No malicious or sabotage-related code detected.",
