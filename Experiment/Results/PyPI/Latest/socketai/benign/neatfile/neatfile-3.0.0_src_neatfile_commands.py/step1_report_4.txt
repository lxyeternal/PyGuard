{
  "purpose": "Execute CLI commands for processing files, including cleaning, sorting, and committing changes based on user settings and confirmation.",
  "sources": "find_processable_files (reads list of files), settings (reads configuration options), console.print (outputs confirmation table), Confirm.ask (reads user input), File (reads file attributes), commit_changes (reads and writes to files) ",
  "sinks": "commit_changes (writes changes to files), console.print and Confirm.ask (outputs and reads user prompts, potentially exposing input), raise cappa.Exit (terminates process), potentially affecting control flow and process termination",
  "flows": "find_processable_files -> File objects -> clean_filename / sort_file -> commit_changes; user confirmation via Confirm.ask influences whether commit_changes is called; no untrusted data flows into security-sensitive sinks such as network, database, or environment variables",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present; standard library usage with no signs of malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code processes files based on user-defined settings, with clear steps for cleaning, sorting, and committing changes. It includes user confirmation prompts and exits gracefully if no changes are made or if the user declines. All functions appear to operate within a file management context without performing network operations, data exfiltration, or system modification beyond file handling. No hidden or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a CLI utility for file processing with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard patterns and does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
