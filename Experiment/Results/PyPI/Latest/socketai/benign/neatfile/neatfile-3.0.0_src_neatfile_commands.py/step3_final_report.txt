  "purpose": "CLI utility for processing files: cleaning filenames, sorting, and committing changes with user confirmation.",
  "sources": "find_processable_files, clean_filename, sort_file, user input via Confirm.ask()",
  "sinks": "commit_changes function (file modifications), user confirmation prompt",
  "flows": "find_processable_files -> clean_filename / sort_file -> commit_changes, with user confirmation before applying changes",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI script that processes files based on user commands, applying cleaning and sorting functions, and then commits changes. It includes user prompts for confirmation, handles no-change scenarios gracefully, and does not perform network operations or system tampering. External functions are standard and expected for such utilities. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The control flow is clear, and the code is transparent and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, transparent CLI utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
