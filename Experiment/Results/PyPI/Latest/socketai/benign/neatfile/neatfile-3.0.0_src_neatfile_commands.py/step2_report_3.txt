  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI utility for processing files: cleaning filenames, sorting, and committing changes.\n- No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The functions invoked (find_processable_files, clean_filename, sort_file, commit_changes) are typical for such utilities.\n- User confirmation is handled via `Confirm.ask()`, and the flow includes safe exit points if no changes are made or user declines.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & flow**: Clear, aligns with the code.\n- **Anomalies**: None detected.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (low, reasonable)\n- **Conclusion**: No issues. \n\n**Verdict**: Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & flow**: Correct.\n- **Anomalies**: None.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (still low, acceptable)\n- **Conclusion**: Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict**: Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & flow**: Correct.\n- **Anomalies**: None.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (low, suitable)\n- **Conclusion**: Valid.\n\n**Verdict**: Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & flow**: Correct.\n- **Anomalies**: None.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (no risk)\n- **Conclusion**: Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict**: Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & flow**: Correct.\n- **Anomalies**: None.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (acceptable)\n- **Conclusion**: Suitable.\n\n**Verdict**: Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores**: Slightly varied but generally low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n**Potential adjustments**:\n- The **securityRisk** scores could be uniformly set to 0, given the absence of any suspicious or risky behavior.\n- The **malware** and **obfuscated** scores are accurate at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Summary**\n\n- The code is a standard CLI file processing utility with proper control flow, user confirmation, and no malicious behavior.\n- The reports' reasoning is sound, and their scores are appropriate.\n- I concur with the assessments: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **securityRisk ≈ 0**.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Value | Justification                                                      |\n|----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0            | No malicious activity detected.                                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                     |\n| SecurityRisk   | 0            | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors observed.                      |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate, and the code poses no security risks. The assigned scores are reasonable, and I recommend maintaining these low risk assessments.",
