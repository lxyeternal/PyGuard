  "sources": "Import statements importing nlp from .nlp and PrintStyle, console, pp from .pretty_print.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; no I/O or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only module imports and exports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports functions and classes from sibling modules and defines an __all__ list for exports. No runtime data handling, network activity, or data processing occurs here. This pattern is typical for module re-exports and does not involve any security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer and export statement with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It simply re-exports existing components for use in other parts of the package.",
