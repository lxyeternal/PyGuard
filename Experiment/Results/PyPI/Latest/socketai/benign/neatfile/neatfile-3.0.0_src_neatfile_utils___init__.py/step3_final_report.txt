  "purpose": "Module initializer that imports specific functions and classes from local modules for re-export.",
  "sources": "Imports from .nlp and .pretty_print modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Import statements to __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py style module that imports functions/classes and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initializer with no malicious or security risks. All signals indicate a standard, safe package setup.",
