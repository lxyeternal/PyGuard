  "purpose": "Utility functions for the neatfile package, exporting NLP and pretty-printing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .nlp and .pretty_print.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external network calls, or sensitive data handling detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only imports and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific functions and classes from local modules and defines the public API via __all__. There are no user inputs, network operations, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present. The structure appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages imports and exports for package components.",
