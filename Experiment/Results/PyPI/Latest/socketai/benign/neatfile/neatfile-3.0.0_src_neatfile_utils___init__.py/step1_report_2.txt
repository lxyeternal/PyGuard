  "purpose": "Utility functions for the neatfile package, exposing modules and classes for NLP and pretty printing.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing 'nlp', 'PrintStyle', 'console', and 'pp' from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no use of untrusted input or data processing shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible due to lack of executable code; no source-to-sink flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward import and export of functions and classes.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific functions and classes from internal modules and defines __all__ for exports. There are no data processing, user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module that re-exports functions and classes for package utility purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
