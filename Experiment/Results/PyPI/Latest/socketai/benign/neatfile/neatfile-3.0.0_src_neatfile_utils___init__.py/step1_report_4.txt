  "purpose": "Utility functions for the neatfile package, exporting NLP and printing utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.nlp and .pretty_print)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation; straightforward module export",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports specific functions and classes from internal modules and defines __all__ for exports. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are present. The structure and syntax are standard for Python package __init__.py files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as an interface to expose certain utilities from the package.",
