  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, the appropriateness of the scores, and any logical inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard string utilities with no suspicious logic, no external data leaks, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly above zero, but justified given the functions are benign.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence in benign nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion and scores seem reasonable. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with standard string processing, no external communication, or malicious logic.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, consistent with benign utility functions.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — very high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard string utilities with reliance on external modules but no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — matches the benign assessment.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly elevated but acceptable for utility code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores and reasoning are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—standard string processing, no external threats, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — aligns with benign utility functions.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high.\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports—string utilities, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- The only minor point is the slightly elevated security risk scores (~0.1-0.2), which are acceptable given the utility nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's benign purpose, a risk score of around 0.1 seems appropriate, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, standard utility code with no external harmful effects.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No adjustments needed.",
