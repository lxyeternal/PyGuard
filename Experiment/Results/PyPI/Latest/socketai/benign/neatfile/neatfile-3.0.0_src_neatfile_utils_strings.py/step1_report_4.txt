  "purpose": "String manipulation utilities for tokenization, case transformation, splitting, and separator detection.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'neatfile.constants' and 'neatfile.utils.nlp'; functions processing input parameters such as 'tokens', 'string', and 'string_list'.",
  "sinks": "Re patterns used for splitting and cleaning tokens; no data sinks involved in malicious data exfiltration or harmful system actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through regex and string operations; no external network connections, file operations, or system modifications are observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'nlp.Defaults.stop_words' implies dependency on spaCy's NLP model, but no suspicious or hidden behavior is evident; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward string processing functions: matching case, splitting camelCase, tokenizing strings, stripping special characters, removing stopwords, transforming case, and guessing separators. No use of external untrusted inputs or system calls. The regex patterns are standard for splitting tokens and removing characters. The use of spaCy stopwords is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. No code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears clean, standard, and focused solely on text processing with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely utility functions for string processing without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No malware or security risks are identified. The code is well-structured and does not exhibit obfuscation or harmful side effects.",
