  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is purely string utility functions with no suspicious logic, external data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The functions are standard, regex-based, and rely on well-known NLP stopword lists.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n  The risk score is low, justified by the benign nature of the code. Malware score is correctly zero, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the functions are standard string utilities with no external communication or malicious intent. Reliance on NLP stopwords is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n  The risk is very low, consistent with the benign analysis. Malware remains correctly at zero.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard string processing functions with no suspicious patterns or external effects. Use of spaCy's stopwords is normal.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n  The risk score is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. Functions are straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 (noted as 0).  \n  The risk score could be slightly increased from 0 to 0.1 to reflect the minimal residual uncertainty, but 0 is acceptable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports—standard string utilities, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n  Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all are zero.  \n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but all are very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code relies on regex and NLP stopword lists, which are common and do not introduce security risks.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, code injection, or malicious logic.\n- The functions are standard utility routines for string processing.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — justified.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, I would suggest a uniform risk score of **0.1** for all reports, slightly above zero to acknowledge the minimal residual concern but still reflecting low risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score aligns with the benign analysis.",
