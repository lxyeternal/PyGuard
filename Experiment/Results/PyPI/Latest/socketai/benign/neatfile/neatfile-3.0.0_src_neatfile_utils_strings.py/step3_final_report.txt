  "purpose": "String utility functions for processing and transforming text, including case matching, splitting camelCase, tokenization, and separator guessing.",
  "sources": "External modules: neatfile.constants, neatfile.utils.nlp, re (regex library). No external data input sources; functions operate on provided arguments.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or system modifications; all operations are internal string manipulations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through regex and NLP functions for processing tokens, splitting strings, and transforming case without external influence or data leakage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; functions are straightforward, with standard regex and NLP usage. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard string processing utilities: matching case, splitting camelCase, tokenizing, stripping special characters, removing stopwords, transforming case, and guessing separators. All functions rely on common regex patterns and NLP stopword lists. No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It performs typical string processing tasks safely. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score should be minimal (~0.1), reflecting the utility nature of the functions.",
