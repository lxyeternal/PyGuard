{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for string processing, including case matching, splitting camelCase, tokenization, special character removal, stopword filtering, case transformation, and separator guessing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as tokens, strings, and match_case_list; external library functions (re, nlp) for stopword list and NLP processing.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data for harmful actions; functions mainly perform string manipulations and regular expressions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through tokenization, string splitting, case matching, and transformations, but no untrusted data is directed to external systems or dangerous functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code appears to perform standard string utilities with no malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of string manipulation functions that rely on regex and standard Python libraries. It does not include network access, file I/O, or execution of untrusted code. It processes data locally and securely, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. Usage of external libraries (re, spaCy) is typical for such utilities. No hidden or obfuscated code is present. Functions like 'match_case', 'split_camel_case', and 'tokenize_string' are standard implementations. The 'nlp' object is used solely for stopword removal, which is a normal NLP practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of string utility functions with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks evident. It performs expected string processing tasks securely without external malicious actions.",
