  "purpose": "String utility functions for processing and transforming text tokens, including case matching, splitting camelCase, tokenizing, stripping special characters, removing stopwords, case transformation, and separator guessing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for each function such as tokens, string_list, and string; regular expressions for token splitting and special character removal.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions perform untrusted data sinks like network transmission, file writing, or system modification.",
  "flows": "Tokens are derived from input strings via regex-based tokenization, split into components, transformed, or filtered. No data is sent to external systems or stored insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls are present. The code relies on standard libraries and a known NLP library. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward string manipulations and transformations using regex and standard Python operations. It references an external NLP module for stopwords, which is typical for natural language processing. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modifications, or network activity. Functions are purely computational with no external or unsafe effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of string utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code appears safe and benign.",
