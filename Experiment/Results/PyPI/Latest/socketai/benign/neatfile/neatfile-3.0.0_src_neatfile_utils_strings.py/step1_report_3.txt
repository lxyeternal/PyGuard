{
  "purpose": "Provide string utility functions for text processing, including case matching, splitting camel case, tokenizing, and separator guessing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (e.g., tokens, strings, match_case_list, string_list, stopwords), and the imported modules 're', 'neatfile.constants', and 'neatfile.utils.nlp'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present where untrusted data directly affects system behavior, data leaks, or external communications.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through regex-based splitting, case transformations, and list comprehensions without external or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard string processing with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for string processing—matching case, splitting camel case, tokenization, removing special characters and stopwords, transforming case, and separator detection. It uses regex and list comprehensions, which are typical for such tasks. The functions depend on external modules ('neatfile.constants', 'neatfile.utils.nlp'), but these are imported modules and not included here. No code indicates malicious intent, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions handle data sanitization and processing safely, with no insecure operations or external communications. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malware-like activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of standard string utility functions for text processing with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be well-structured and safe for use in larger projects. No indicators of malware, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
