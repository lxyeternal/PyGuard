  "purpose": "Define constants, enums, and configuration paths for the neatfile package.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (XDG_*), __package__, __file__",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; environment variables are used for directory paths, which are generally safe but can be influenced externally.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence directory paths, but these are not directly used in untrusted command execution or data processing within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the code strictly defines constants, enums, and paths with no dynamic execution or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up configuration constants, directory paths based on environment variables, and enumerations for various options. It safely uses environment variables with default fallbacks, and the path operations are straightforward. There are no data flows from untrusted sources into sensitive sinks, nor are there any dynamic code execution, network operations, or file manipulations that could indicate malicious intent. The enums and properties are standard Python constructs without any obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration and constants definition module for the package. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it pose any security risks. It appears safe and correctly structured.",
