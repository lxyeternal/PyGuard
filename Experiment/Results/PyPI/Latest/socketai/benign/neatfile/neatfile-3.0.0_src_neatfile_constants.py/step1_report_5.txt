{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, configuration paths, enums, and regex patterns for the neatfile package, primarily for configuration management and categorization.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (XDG_CONFIG_HOME, XDG_DATA_HOME, XDG_STATE_HOME, XDG_CACHE_HOME), __package__, __file__",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flows into insecure sinks such as network or system calls",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence directory paths, but only for configuration management; no untrusted data flows to system or network",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; use of standard environment variables and safe pattern matching methods",
  "analysis": "The code uses environment variables to determine configuration directories, which is a common and safe practice. It defines enums and regex patterns for categorization. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. All environment variables are used for configuration paths, which is typical. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic. The code is well-structured, with clear comments and no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard configuration and constant definitions for the package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on environment variables and internal logic, with no external or untrusted input handling beyond environment variables used for configuration paths.",
