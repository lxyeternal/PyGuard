  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is static configuration, defining constants and enums with no dynamic or malicious behavior. It notes the safe handling of environment variables and the use of match-case for pattern selection, which is safe.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0. All consistent with the static, benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the safe use of environment variables and standard Python constructs. No suspicious activity or data flow.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0, matching the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is purely configuration, with environment variables used for paths, enums for options, and no dynamic or malicious code. Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) possibly due to environment variable influence, but this is standard practice.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.1, which seems reasonable given environment variable influence but no actual threat.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous analyses; no dynamic code, no untrusted data processing, safe pattern matching, and environment variables used appropriately.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.1, aligned with standard configuration code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—configuration constants, safe environment variable usage, no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.1, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score 0). The code is static configuration with no executable or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to environment variable influence, but this is standard and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, static, and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, due to environment variable influence, but not a security concern.\n\nThe scores in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign configuration module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The environment variable usage is standard and does not introduce vulnerabilities in this context.",
