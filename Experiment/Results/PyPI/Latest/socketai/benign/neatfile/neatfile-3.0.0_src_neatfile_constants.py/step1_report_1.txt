  "purpose": "Define constants, configuration paths, enums, and patterns for the neatfile package.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (XDG_CONFIG_HOME, XDG_DATA_HOME, XDG_STATE_HOME, XDG_CACHE_HOME), __package__, __file__",
  "sinks": "None identified that directly execute or process untrusted input; static configuration values are used.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Path objects; package path -> configuration paths and constants; enum properties -> regex patterns",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or executable code. The code is static configuration and enum definitions. The pattern property in FolderType uses match-case which is safe. No suspicious logic or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines constants, configuration paths based on environment variables, and enums with associated properties. It safely handles environment variables, with proper defaults, and constructs paths. The pattern property provides regex patterns based on enum values with standard match-case syntax. No user input is processed, and no external data flows into sensitive sinks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to best practices for static configuration definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely uses environment variables, contains no executable or data-leaking code, and defines enums and constants in a secure manner.",
