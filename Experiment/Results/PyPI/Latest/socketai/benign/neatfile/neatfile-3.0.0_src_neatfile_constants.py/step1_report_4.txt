  "purpose": "Define constants, configuration paths, and enumerations for the neatfile package.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (XDG_CONFIG_HOME, XDG_DATA_HOME, XDG_STATE_HOME, XDG_CACHE_HOME), __package__, __file__",
  "sinks": "Path constructions using environment variables, enum property methods (no direct sinks for untrusted data)",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence path creation, which is used internally; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Use of environment variables is standard and safe here.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets constants and enumerations for package configuration and does not process external input data or execute dynamic code. Environment variables are used to determine configuration paths, which is standard practice and poses no security risk. Enum classes provide controlled options with no suspicious behavior. The property method in FolderType uses pattern matching with standard string returns and raises exceptions for invalid values, which is typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, defining configuration constants and enums with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not process untrusted data, execute code dynamically, or contain any signs of malware. It appears to be a safe component of a larger package.",
