  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code defines constants, environment variable-based paths, enums, and regex patterns. No untrusted input processing, no dynamic code, no secrets, no suspicious logic.\n- **Assessment:** The code is static configuration, safe, and straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** Fully benign, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no dynamic or malicious behavior, environment variables used for paths, no untrusted data processing.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, standard configuration code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—configuration constants, environment variables, enums, regex patterns, no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — slightly above zero, but still very low, possibly reflecting minimal inherent risk in environment variable usage.\n\n**Justification for securityRisk=0.1:** The slight increase may be due to reliance on environment variables, which can be influenced externally, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n**Conclusion:** Safe, with negligible risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports—configuration, environment variables, enums, regexes, no suspicious logic.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — consistent with previous.\n\n**Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above—configuration constants, environment variables, safe patterns.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports confirm the code is static, configuration-oriented, with no dynamic execution, data leaks, or malicious patterns.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** No significant errors. The only minor point is the slight elevation of `securityRisk` to 0.1 in some reports, which seems to be a conservative estimate acknowledging the use of environment variables, but this is standard and not risky.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are zero, which is correct. Obfuscation is zero, which is accurate. Security risk scores are very low (0.1), justified by the use of environment variables, but this does not imply actual risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the static, safe nature of the code, I would assign a score of **0.0** or **0.1** at most, to reflect minimal inherent risk due to environment variable influence, but not actual vulnerability.\n\n**Note:** The code is purely declarative, with no executable logic that could be exploited or obfuscated. The environment variables are standard and safe, used for configuration paths.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Recommendation | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                      | No malicious code or behavior detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                      | No obfuscation present; code is straightforward.            |\n| Security Risk    | 0.0 - 0.1              | Minimal risk due to environment variable reliance, but standard practice. |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.**",
