  "purpose": "Defines constants, environment-based paths, and enums for configuration and categorization within the package.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for config/data/state/cache directories; __file__ for project and package paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code only sets paths and defines enums.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence path variables; no data flows into or out of untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is static and straightforward, with proper error handling in pattern property.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module that sets directory paths based on environment variables, defines enums for verbosity, folder types, project types, separators, case transformations, insertion points, and date regions. It uses safe Path operations and match-case for pattern selection, with no dynamic code execution, data processing, or network activity. The environment variables are used with defaults, which is standard practice. No secrets, secrets handling, or malicious logic are present. The pattern property in FolderType is implemented safely with proper error handling. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It safely uses environment variables for path setup and defines enums for internal categorization. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is negligible (~0.1) due to environment variable reliance, which is standard. Overall, it is safe and appropriate for use.",
