  "purpose": "Define constants, enumerations, and configuration paths for the neatfile package.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (XDG_CONFIG_HOME, XDG_DATA_HOME, XDG_STATE_HOME, XDG_CACHE_HOME), __file__, __package__, and hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data is used in critical security-sensitive functions or commands.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence directory paths; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard practices for configuration and enum definitions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets constants and enum classes for configuration and categorization purposes. Directory paths are constructed using environment variables with default fallbacks, following standard conventions. No dynamic execution, code injection, or untrusted data handling is evident. The pattern property in FolderType employs pattern matching but is straightforward and safe. The code appears to be purely declarative and configuration-oriented, with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It functions as a configuration/constants module for the package. The overall security risk is negligible.",
