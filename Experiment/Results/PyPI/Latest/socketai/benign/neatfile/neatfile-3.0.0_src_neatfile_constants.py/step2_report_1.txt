  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is a static configuration module defining constants, environment-based paths, and enums.\n- They confirm that no untrusted input is processed, no dynamic code execution occurs, and no data leaks or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The environment variables are used solely for configuration path setup, which is standard practice.\n- The pattern property in FolderType uses match-case to return regex strings safely, with proper error handling.\n- The malware scores are all zero, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1), consistent with the absence of dynamic or unsafe operations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** None identified. The code is static, safe, and well-structured.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical or security flaws apparent.\n- **Scores:** All are reasonable; malware = 0, risk ≈ 0.1, obfuscated = 0.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- **Malware potential:** None. The code only defines constants and enums.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** Minimal; the only potential concern is reliance on environment variables, which is standard and acceptable here.\n\n### Assumptions and Claims:\n- The reports correctly interpret the code as static configuration.\n- No hidden malicious logic or backdoors are present.\n- The pattern property is safe and correctly implemented.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven all the above, I agree with the reports' conclusions that this code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (standard environment variable usage for configuration paths; negligible risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a safe, static configuration module with no security concerns.**",
