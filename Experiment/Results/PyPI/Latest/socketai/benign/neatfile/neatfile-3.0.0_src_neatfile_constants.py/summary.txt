  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It safely uses environment variables for path setup and defines enums for internal categorization. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is negligible (~0.1) due to environment variable reliance, which is standard. Overall, it is safe and appropriate for use."
