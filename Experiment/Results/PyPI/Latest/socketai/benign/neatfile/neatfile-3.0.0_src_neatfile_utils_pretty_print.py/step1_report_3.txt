  "purpose": "Provide utilities for styled console output with logging and message formatting using the rich library, supporting customizable styles and singleton logging behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration for styles, messages, and style lookups. It also reads input strings or dictionaries for message content, and optional keyword arguments for console printing.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include console.print() calls which output styled messages to the terminal. The code also processes dict objects into JSON strings, which could leak data if malicious data is provided.",
  "flows": "Input data (messages, style configurations) flows into _print() where styles are applied and messages are printed. The get_style_by_name() function retrieves style configurations, and the configure() method updates styles and flags. The dynamic attribute access (__getattr__) creates style-based logging functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically generates style-based methods, which is normal for such logging utilities. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious domain connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code processes dicts into JSON, which could reveal data if malicious data is provided, but this is a standard pattern. No obfuscated or unnecessary dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton class for styled logging with configurable styles. It merges user styles with defaults, retrieves styles case-insensitively, and outputs styled messages via rich. It also provides methods for visual separation and listing styles. The dynamic __getattr__ method creates style-specific logging functions, which is standard for flexible logging libraries. No network activity, external data leaks, or malicious code execution mechanisms are present. The code only outputs to the console and processes data in a typical manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign styled console logging utility. It does not include any malicious behaviors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activities. The processing of dicts to JSON is standard for logging purposes. Overall, the code is consistent with a legitimate logging utility and shows no signs of malicious intent.",
