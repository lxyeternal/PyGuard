  "purpose": "Provides styled console output utilities with singleton pattern, supporting multiple log levels and customizable styles using 'rich'.",
  "sources": "Console output via 'rich.console.Console', message formatting with regex and json.dumps for dicts.",
  "sinks": "console.print, console.rule, message display, json serialization of dicts.",
  "flows": "Input messages processed (string or dict) -> formatted with regex or json -> styled with 'rich' -> output via console.print.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, network activity, or obfuscated code detected. Regex for inline code styling is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a styled logging utility implementing singleton pattern, style merging, and dynamic method creation for different log levels. Message formatting includes regex substitution for inline code and JSON dumps for dicts, both standard in logging. No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior observed. The JSON serialization could leak data if malicious data is logged, but this is a common pattern, not malicious. The code is clear, maintainable, and intended solely for styled console output.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured styled logging utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The minor security concern relates to potential data leakage via JSON dumps, which is typical in logging but not malicious.",
