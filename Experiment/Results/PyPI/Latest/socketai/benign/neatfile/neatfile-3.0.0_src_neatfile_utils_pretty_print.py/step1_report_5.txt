{
  "purpose": "Provides utilities for styled console output using rich formatting, implementing a singleton pattern for consistent message logging across an application with multiple log levels and customizable styles.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'rich' library for console and text formatting; no external input sources; no input reading functions present.",
  "sinks": "Uses console.print() and console.rule() for output; messages are constructed with styles and can include JSON dumps of dicts; no data leaks or network activities detected.",
  "flows": "Messages processed and styled in _print() and dynamically via __getattr__, with style merging and style retrieval functions; no untrusted data flows outside message formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or hidden functionalities; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; regex for inline code styling appears benign; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a styled logging utility with singleton pattern, style configuration merging, and dynamic method creation for style-based logging. It processes messages with safe string operations and JSON serialization for dicts, without executing untrusted code or network operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The use of 'rich' library is standard for formatting, and the code structure is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, safe styled console logger with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network activity, data leaks, or backdoors. The only potential concern is the regex replacing backtick-enclosed text with styled markup, but this is benign and intended for formatting purposes.",
