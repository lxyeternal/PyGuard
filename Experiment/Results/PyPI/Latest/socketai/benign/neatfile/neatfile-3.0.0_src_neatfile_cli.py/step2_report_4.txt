  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the described behaviors, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Purpose:** Describes the code as a CLI for filename normalization, project management, with configuration handling.\n\n**Sources & Sinks:** Filesystem reads/writes, configuration files, no network or dynamic code execution.\n\n**Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, standard filesystem operations.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious behavior or malware signals.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct, no malicious code detected)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Confidence:** 0.9 (high confidence in safety)\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Purpose:** Similar to above, focusing on filename normalization, configuration, and project organization.\n\n**Sources & Sinks:** User input, filesystem operations, no network activity.\n\n**Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, standard library usage.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; the code is safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, possibly due to filesystem operations but not malicious)\n\n**Confidence:** 0.9\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Purpose:** Same general purpose, filename normalization, project management.\n\n**Sources & Sinks:** Filesystem reads/writes, configuration files, no network.\n\n**Flow & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, standard CLI operations.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears safe, standard filesystem and configuration handling.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Confidence:** 0.95\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Purpose:** CLI for filename normalization, project management, commands for cleaning, processing, sorting.\n\n**Sources & Sinks:** Filesystem, configuration files, no network.\n\n**Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, standard libraries, no malicious code.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate file management CLI, safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (again, filesystem operations but no security concern)\n\n**Confidence:** 0.95\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Purpose:** Similar to above, filename normalization, project management, configuration.\n\n**Sources & Sinks:** Filesystem, configuration files, no network.\n\n**Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, standard operations.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Confidence:** 0.95\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code only performs filesystem and configuration management, which are typical for CLI tools.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), justified by filesystem operations, but these are standard and not security risks.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not contain any dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden payloads.\n- It uses standard libraries and patterns for CLI tools.\n- The filesystem operations (reading, copying config files, renaming files) are safe and common.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal filesystem operations, but not a security concern)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malware or malicious intent. The existing scores are reasonable, but I would suggest lowering the \"securityRisk\" scores from 0.1 to 0 for a more accurate reflection of the absence of security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the thorough analysis and the detailed reports provided.",
