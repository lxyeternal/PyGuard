  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a CLI for filename normalization and project management. It reads configs, copies default configs, handles user inputs, and executes commands. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns are present.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, with no malicious activity. The operations are standard filesystem and configuration handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, focusing on CLI for filename normalization and project organization. No network, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Findings:** Uses standard libraries, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero, possibly due to filesystem operations)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk score seems appropriate given the filesystem interactions, but no malware or malicious intent is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a CLI for filename normalization, configuration, and project management. No network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Findings:** Standard pattern, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments, the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, handling configuration, file operations, and project management. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no secrets, standard libraries.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (again, filesystem operations are noted)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behavior, operations are typical for a CLI tool.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: a legitimate CLI for filename normalization and project management, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no network, no secrets.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, which aligns with filesystem operations that are typical for such tools.\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (safe, standard filesystem and configuration handling)\n\nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI utility with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided source and reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores are appropriate given the filesystem operations involved, which are typical for such utilities.",
