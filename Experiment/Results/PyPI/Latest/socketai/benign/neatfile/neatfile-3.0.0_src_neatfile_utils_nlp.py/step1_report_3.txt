  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard use of spaCy for NLP utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code imports spaCy and loads a pre-trained language model, which is a common setup step for NLP applications. No user input, data reading, or untrusted sources are present. The code does not perform any operations that could leak data or execute malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for NLP processing with spaCy. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
