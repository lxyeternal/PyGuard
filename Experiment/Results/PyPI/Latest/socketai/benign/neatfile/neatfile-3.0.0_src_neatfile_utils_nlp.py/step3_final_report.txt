  "purpose": "Load the spaCy NLP library and initialize the English language model.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'spacy' library and loading the 'en_core_web_md' model.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "Import spacy -> load 'en_core_web_md' model; no data flows to external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for NLP setup. It imports the spaCy library and loads a pre-trained language model without any input/output, network activity, or data handling beyond model loading. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, external data fetching, or suspicious constructs. Given the benign nature, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign NLP setup snippet with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
