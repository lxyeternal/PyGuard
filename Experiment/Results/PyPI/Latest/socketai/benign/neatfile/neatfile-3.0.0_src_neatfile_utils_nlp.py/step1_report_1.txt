  "purpose": "Natural language processing utilities using spaCy library.",
  "sources": "Loading the spaCy language model 'en_core_web_md'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is sent to external sources or untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "Code loads a pre-trained NLP model, with no data flow from input to output within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the spaCy library and loads a medium-sized English language model. There are no input sources beyond the model loading, nor are there any sinks such as network calls or file writes. No unusual or malicious patterns are evident. This appears to be standard NLP setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and standard for NLP tasks, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
