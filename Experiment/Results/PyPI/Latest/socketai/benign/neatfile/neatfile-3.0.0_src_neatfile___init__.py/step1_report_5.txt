  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple module that exposes a 'settings' object imported from a local 'config' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .config import settings",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or data output shown",
  "flows": "Import from .config leads to exposing 'settings', which could be used elsewhere",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no apparent anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'settings' from a local module and defines __all__ for export. There are no suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security risks visible in this fragment. It functions as a simple module exporter.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module that exposes 'settings' without any malicious intent or security issues.",
