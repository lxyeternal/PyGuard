{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that exposes a 'settings' object from a local config package, likely for configuration management.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'config' module, specifically the 'settings' object.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any evident sinks where untrusted data could be exploited, such as network operations, file writes, or command executions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing 'settings' from 'config' and exposing it via __all__, but there are no data transformations or external interactions beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed; the code is minimal and standard for Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'settings' from a local module 'config' and exposes it as part of the module's public API. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data processing, and no external calls or side-effects. The structure is typical for configuration modules. No signs of malicious code, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module that exposes configuration settings; it contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be safe and standard for managing configurations within a larger project.",
