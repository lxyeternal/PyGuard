{
  "purpose": "This code module imports a 'settings' object from a local 'config' module and exposes it via __all__, serving as a configuration export point.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .config import settings reads data from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows to potentially cause data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The data flow is limited to importing 'settings' from the local module and exposing it; no external data or untrusted inputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple configuration module that imports 'settings' from a local 'config' module and exposes it via __all__. There are no functions, no data processing, no external inputs, and no dynamic code execution. The code structure is standard for configuration management. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning low or zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence levels. The data flow is limited to a local import and export, with no external or untrusted data involved. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal configuration export module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action or concern is necessary.",
