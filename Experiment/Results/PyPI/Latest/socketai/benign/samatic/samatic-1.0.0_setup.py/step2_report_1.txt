  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script.\n- The code reads 'README.md' via Path().read_text(), which is common in setup scripts.\n- No untrusted data sources, external network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, with package metadata and directory exclusions.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the lack of any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct since the code is clear and conventional.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The code is safe, with no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- The only minor note is that reading files during setup is typical but should be done carefully; however, in this context, it’s standard practice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate. The scores reflect the actual security posture of the code.",
