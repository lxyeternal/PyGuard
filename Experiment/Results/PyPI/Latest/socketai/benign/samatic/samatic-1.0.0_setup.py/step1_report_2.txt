  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to potential data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content during setup process; no data flows to sinks with untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. Use of Path to read a file is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup and uses Path to read the README file for long description. No dynamic code execution, no input from untrusted sources, no network activity, or hidden behaviors. The setup configuration appears standard and benign, focusing solely on packaging details without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
