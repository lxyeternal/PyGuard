  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'samatic' project, defining metadata and reading long description from README.md.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file using Path().read_text() for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or external inputs; no data leaks or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' from disk; passing package metadata to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script utilizing setuptools and pathlib. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, which is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input is present. The code structure is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The use of Path().read_text() is common and safe in this context. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities is found. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
