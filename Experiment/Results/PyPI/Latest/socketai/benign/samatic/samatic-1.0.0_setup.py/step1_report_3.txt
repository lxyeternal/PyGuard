  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors; standard setup script",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup and pathlib for file handling. It reads the README.md file content for long_description, which is a common practice. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. The package configuration appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
