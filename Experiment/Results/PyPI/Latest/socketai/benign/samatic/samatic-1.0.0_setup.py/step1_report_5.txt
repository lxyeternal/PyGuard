  "purpose": "Configure the package metadata and setup for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file to include long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content as long_description during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and pathlib, then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. It reads 'README.md' content for the long_description field, which is standard practice for Python packages. No user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code structure is typical and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard package setup without any malicious intent or security issues. It is a legitimate setup script for a Python package.",
