  "purpose": "Configure the setup for the 'samatic' Python package, including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Path('README.md').read_text() to read long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data output or external calls.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md file as long description during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward setup configuration. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports or functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and Path for filesystem interaction. It calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata, including reading the README.md file for long description. The code appears standard for Python packaging with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or security issues. It excludes certain directories from packages. There are no external network calls, no use of environment variables in a suspicious manner, and no dynamic code execution present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and is secure in its current form.",
