{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a minimal or non-existent Python dependency, with no malicious indicators or obfuscation observed.",
  "sources": "No data sources; code is absent or minimal.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data flows detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code is either empty or trivial.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence or minimal content of code, leading to low malware and obfuscation scores. The risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the lack of evidence for malicious activity. Confidence levels are justified based on the available information. Slight adjustments to risk scores in some reports (e.g., reducing from 0.2-0.3 to 0.1-0.2) could improve consistency, but overall, the assessments are sound.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are consistent and appropriate given the absence of code. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected, and the security risk is minimal. The scores accurately reflect the limited information, and no further modifications are necessary.",
