{
  "purpose": "A simple script to display an animated mood booster message in the console.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the environment via os.name and os.system calls, and time.sleep for delays.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes system commands ('cls' or 'clear') to clear the console; no untrusted data is used here.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves the OS type to decide which clear command to run, then executes system calls to clear the console, and uses sleep to create delays in animation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity or data leaks. The code primarily performs console animation.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard libraries (os and time) for console output and timing delays. It clears the terminal and animates a simple figure, which is typical for command-line interfaces. No data is read from untrusted sources, and no malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system manipulation are present. There are no backdoors, no code injections, and no suspicious behavior beyond normal console animation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign console animation script intended to boost mood visually. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
