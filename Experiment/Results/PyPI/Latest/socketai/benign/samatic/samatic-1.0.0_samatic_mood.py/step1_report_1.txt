{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple console-based visual animation that simulates a shaking motion to boost user mood.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information via os.name, and system command execution via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system is used to clear the console screen, which is a benign operation intended for visual effect.",
  "flows": "Input from environment (os.name) influences system command executed to clear console; no user input is processed, and no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors observed. The code uses standard library functions for console manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to clear the console and animate a simple shaking figure in the terminal. It relies on os.system to execute 'cls' or 'clear' based on the OS, which is a common method for clearing the terminal screen. The use of sleep delays and looping creates an animated effect. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden payloads are detected. The code’s behavior is solely visual and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visual animation script with no malicious intent or security risks. It only manipulates the console output for aesthetic purposes and does not perform any harmful operations.",
