  "purpose": "The code is designed to display an animated shaking figure in the console as a mood booster.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only uses standard library functions os.system and time.sleep.",
  "sinks": "The code executes os.system to clear the console screen, which is a benign operation intended for user interface purposes.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; the flow is solely for visual output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The loop and display logic are straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries os and time, defines a function to clear the console, and a function to animate a mood booster. It repeatedly clears the console and prints frames to simulate shaking. The code involves no user input, no network activity, and no file operations beyond console display. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code appears purely for entertainment or user interface purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended for visual entertainment in the terminal. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
