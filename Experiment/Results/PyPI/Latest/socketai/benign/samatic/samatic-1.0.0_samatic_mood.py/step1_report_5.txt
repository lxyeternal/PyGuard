{
  "purpose": "A simple script to display a mood-boosting animation in the console.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/output for console display and uses the 'os' and 'time' modules.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a shell command to clear the console; 'print' outputs to the terminal.",
  "flows": "The script uses a loop to repeatedly display frames, with no untrusted data input or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard modules 'os' and 'time' to create an animated console display. It detects the operating system to run appropriate clear commands. No user input is processed, and no data is sent or received over the network. The code is straightforward and intended solely for visual effect. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are present. All functions and calls are typical for such animations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign console animation with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is safe for use.",
