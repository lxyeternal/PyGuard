  "conclusion": "The code pattern enables obfuscation and dynamic code execution, which can be exploited maliciously, but no explicit malicious payloads are present. The use of runtime decryption and exec() warrants caution. The scores reflect the potential risks but do not confirm malicious activity. Overall, the code should be treated as potentially dangerous if used with untrusted inputs or encrypted payloads, and further validation of the TokenCryptor's behavior is recommended."
