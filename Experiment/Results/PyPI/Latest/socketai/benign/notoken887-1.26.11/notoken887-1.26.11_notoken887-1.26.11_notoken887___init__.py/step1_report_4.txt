  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script intended for data processing or transformation, possibly involving reading input data, performing computations, and outputting results.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown; the code does not read from external files, network, or environment variables within the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Output functions or data sinks are not clearly visible; no direct data leaks, network transmissions, or file writes are evident in the snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are observable; the code performs internal computations without external data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code uses standard syntax and constructs. No obfuscation or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code executes basic operations such as variable assignments, mathematical computations, or simple function calls. There are no external inputs processed, no insecure functions, no data exfiltration, or network activity. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. Without external context or additional code, no anomalies or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, performing routine computations or processing without engaging in any harmful actions.",
