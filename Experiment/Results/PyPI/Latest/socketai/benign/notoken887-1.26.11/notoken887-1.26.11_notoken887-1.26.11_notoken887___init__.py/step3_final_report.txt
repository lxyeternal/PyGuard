  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, import statements, function definitions, data flows from input to output or sinks.",
  "sinks": "External data outputs, network connections, file writes, eval/exec calls, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (network, file, eval/exec).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code patterns, unusual dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports indicate minimal or benign code snippets with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the descriptions. Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting conservative caution given limited context. Confidence levels are appropriate, with higher confidence in straightforward, well-understood code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified. The reasoning aligns with the code snippets and descriptions, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets and assessments indicate no malicious or obfuscated code, with low security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the provided information. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on the available data.",
