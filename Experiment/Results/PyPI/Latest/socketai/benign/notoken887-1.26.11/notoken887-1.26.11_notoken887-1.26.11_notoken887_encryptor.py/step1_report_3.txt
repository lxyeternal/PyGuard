{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character substitution encryption and decryption methods, likely for obfuscation or playful encoding of data.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; the class operates on provided string arguments to its methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; the code solely performs string replacements without external communication or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed through character replacements in both encrypt and decrypt methods, reversing each other's character mappings.",
  "anomalies": "The code is highly repetitive with extensive manual replacements; no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden malicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a straightforward, static character substitution cipher with explicit mappings. It contains no external input handling, no network communication, and no system modifications. The structure is simple and transparent, with no evidence of malicious intent. The code does not exhibit obfuscation, complex logic, or covert behaviors. It appears to serve a benign purpose, possibly for encoding or playful data obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic character substitution cipher with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious, but its simplistic approach offers no real security. Overall, the code is benign and non-malicious.",
