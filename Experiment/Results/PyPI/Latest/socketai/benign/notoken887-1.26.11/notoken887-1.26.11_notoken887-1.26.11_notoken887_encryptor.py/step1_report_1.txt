{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple character substitution methods to encode and decode strings using emoji replacements.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via method parameters 'string' and 'encrypted_token' in the encrypt and decrypt functions.",
  "sinks": "The methods output the transformed strings; no external data sinks or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings pass through character replacements in 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' to produce obfuscated or restored text.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive character substitution with no apparent encryption or cryptographic security; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are evident. The code does not interact with external systems, files, or network resources. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The class provides simple substitution cipher functionality based solely on replacing characters with emojis and vice versa. The methods operate through chained 'replace' calls, which are straightforward and do not involve external inputs beyond the function parameters. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The implementation appears to be a benign obfuscation or encoding scheme. No security risks or malware behavior are detected based on this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a basic character substitution cipher for obfuscation purposes. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The design is simple and transparent, with no signs of sabotage or malware. The code is safe to use from a security standpoint.",
