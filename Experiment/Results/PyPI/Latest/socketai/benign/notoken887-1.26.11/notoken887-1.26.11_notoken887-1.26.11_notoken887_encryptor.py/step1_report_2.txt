{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution cipher methods to encrypt and decrypt strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through method parameters 'string' in encrypt() and 'encrypted_token' in decrypt().",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present. No network or system calls are made.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to internal replace calls, converting characters to emojis and back.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs straightforward character replacement without any obfuscation or dynamic execution. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The cipher is simplistic and not secure, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic substitution cipher using replace() calls for both encryption and decryption. It translates characters to emojis and back. The approach is static and simple, with no external calls or data leaks. There are no signs of malware, malicious data exfiltration, or sabotage. The only concern is the extremely weak encryption method, which provides no real security, but that does not constitute malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple character-to-emoji substitution for obfuscation, with no malicious intent or behavior. It appears to be an intentionally trivial cipher, not malware. No security risks are present beyond the weak encryption scheme.",
