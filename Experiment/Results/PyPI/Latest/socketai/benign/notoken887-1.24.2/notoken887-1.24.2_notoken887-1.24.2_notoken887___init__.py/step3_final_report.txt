  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code signals such as obfuscation, malicious payloads, or insecure practices.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, files, network operations, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), standard library functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communications, file system, subprocess calls, environment variables, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or system calls), potentially via dynamic execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec, lack of comments, dynamic code execution, signs of obfuscation (high obfuscation score).",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads in the benign reports, with high confidence (0.7-0.8). Report 4 shows obfuscation and dynamic execution signs, justifying higher suspicion scores. The absence of explicit malicious activity supports low malware (0-0.2) and security risk scores (0.2-0.4). The assessments are consistent with the described signals, with the main concern being obfuscation in Report 4. Input validation and external interactions are potential areas for further review if code is available. Overall, the code appears benign with cautious scoring for obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely benign, with no evidence of malicious payloads. Obfuscation in Report 4 warrants attention but does not confirm malicious intent. Scores are appropriate, reflecting low malware risk and moderate obfuscation suspicion.",
