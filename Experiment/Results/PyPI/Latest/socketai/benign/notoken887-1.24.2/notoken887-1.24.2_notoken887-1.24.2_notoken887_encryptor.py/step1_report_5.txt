  "purpose": "Obfuscate and deobfuscate a token using simple character replacements.",
  "sources": "The input token string in main(), provided directly in code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent over network, written to disk, or used in potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Token string flows into encrypt() method, which transforms it into an obfuscated form; then decrypt() can revert it back.",
  "anomalies": "The code simply performs character substitution for encoding/decoding, no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network communication, file access, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The class provides basic obfuscation of a token through character replacements, likely to obscure the token from casual observation. The methods are symmetric and straightforward, with no external data input besides the hardcoded token in main(). There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code structure is simple, with clear functions performing predictable replacements. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The only noteworthy aspect is the use of emojis for obfuscation, which does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a simple character-based obfuscator/deobfuscator for a token. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign utility with no suspicious signals.",
