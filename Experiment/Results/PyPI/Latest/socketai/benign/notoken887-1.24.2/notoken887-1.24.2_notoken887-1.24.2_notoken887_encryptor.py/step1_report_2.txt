{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides methods to encode (encrypt) and decode (decrypt) a token string by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input token string in the main() function and the token variable directly; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The encrypted token is printed to standard output; no other data sinks are present. No external data or sensitive information is transmitted or stored.",
  "flows": "Input token -> encrypt() (character replacements) -> encrypted token -> printed output; no data flows to external systems or files.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward character replacements without any suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or secret keys are evident beyond the token string itself. The replace method is used simply for obfuscation, not for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The class performs simple character substitution to obfuscate a token string. The replace method is used in a sequential manner, which is a common approach for basic encoding. There are no external inputs, network communications, or sensitive data leaks observed. The token string in main() appears to be a sample or placeholder, not a hardcoded secret. No malicious or suspicious code patterns, such as code injection, system commands, or data exfiltration mechanisms, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a basic character substitution cipher for a token, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is an obfuscation tool rather than malicious code. Therefore, it presents no security threats or malware concerns.",
