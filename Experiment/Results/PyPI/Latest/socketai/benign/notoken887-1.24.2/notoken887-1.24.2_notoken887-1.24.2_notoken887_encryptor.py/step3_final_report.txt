  "purpose": "Simple emoji-based character substitution cipher for token obfuscation and deobfuscation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded token string in main() function.",
  "sinks": "Output printed to console.",
  "flows": "Token string is encrypted via character replacements, then printed; decryption reverses the process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of superficial emoji substitution for obfuscation; presence of hardcoded token.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward, deterministic character replacements to obfuscate a token string. No external data inputs, network activity, or system modifications are present. The token appears to be a placeholder or sample token, not dynamically fetched or sensitive. The substitution method is simple and not cryptographically secure, but it does not contain malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The decryption method reverses the substitutions accurately. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility implementing a trivial character substitution cipher for token obfuscation. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain security risks. The presence of a hardcoded token is a potential security concern in real deployment but does not constitute malicious activity or sabotage. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score remains at 0.",
