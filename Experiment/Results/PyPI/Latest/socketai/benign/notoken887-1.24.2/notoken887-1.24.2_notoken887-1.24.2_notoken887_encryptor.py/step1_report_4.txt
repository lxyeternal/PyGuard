{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple character substitution cipher for 'encrypting' and 'decrypting' tokens by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The 'token' variable in main() which holds a string potentially representing an authentication token.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statement outputs the encrypted token to standard output; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The token is passed into encrypt() to produce an emoji-based cipher, then outputted; no further data flow to external systems or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The encryption is purely obfuscation via character replacement; no malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present.",
  "analysis": "The class TokenCryptor performs straightforward character substitution to obscure the input token. The encrypt() and decrypt() functions are inverse mappings. There are no sources of untrusted data beyond the initial token string, which is a hardcoded string within main(). The process is deterministic and solely for obfuscation, not security. No code injection, system calls, network activity, or privacy violations are present. The code's design is simple and benign, serving only to encode/decode tokens with emojis. No anomalies or malicious intents are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a basic obfuscation tool, with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
