{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata for distribution using setuptools, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Static parameters in setup() such as name, version, author, author_email, description, url, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the script does not process untrusted input or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; all parameters are static and hardcoded, with no data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious contact info: author_email='hitler@gmail.com' and url='https://thugging.org', which are provocative but do not affect code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with static configuration. No malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior is present. The only anomalies are metadata that could be provocative or unprofessional. No code-based threats are detected. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to metadata concerns. The code itself is benign, and the metadata alone does not constitute malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign with suspicious metadata that does not translate into actual malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the static, non-malicious nature of the code.",
