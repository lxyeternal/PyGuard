  "flows": "N/A (No data flow or untrusted data paths).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of suspicious email address ('hitler@gmail.com'), unprofessional URL ('https://thugging.org'), and package name 'notoken887' which may suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is a standard setuptools configuration defining package details. The email address and URL are unconventional and potentially malicious or intended for malicious obfuscation. No code execution, data handling, or external communication occurs within this script. No indicators of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The package metadata alone does not indicate malicious intent but raises suspicion due to unprofessional contact details and URL, possibly indicating malicious or maliciously intended packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration with suspicious contact details and URL, which could be indicators of malicious intent or obfuscation. However, the script itself does not contain malicious code or behaviors. It warrants caution due to metadata clues but does not demonstrate malicious activity directly.",
