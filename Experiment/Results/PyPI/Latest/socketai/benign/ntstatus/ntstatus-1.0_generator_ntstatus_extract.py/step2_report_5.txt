  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the script's role in parsing NTSTATUS definitions and generating Python constants.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Correctly notes the use of regex, no suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Finds no malicious behavior, assigns a malware score of 0, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** This report is accurate. The code is straightforward, benign, and performs standard file parsing and code generation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the script reads input files and appends constants.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation; uses sys.exit for error handling—standard in scripts.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malware or malicious intent detected, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent with the code. No issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description, accurately captures the process.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no external network activity, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign utility, no malicious behavior, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the script's function.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Uses sys.exit(), standard regex, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious activity; operation is transparent and safe.\n\n**Note:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk score (0.1), perhaps reflecting the abrupt sys.exit() usage, but this is typical in scripts and not malicious.\n\n**Assessment:** Still consistent with benign code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Straightforward parsing, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate code generator, no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is a benign, straightforward script for parsing header files and generating Python constants.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The use of sys.exit() is typical for scripts with command-line interfaces.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n\n### Final Security Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** Given the straightforward nature, a low risk score (~0.1) is appropriate, mainly due to abrupt termination behavior, but this is standard and not malicious.\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\n- The code is a benign utility for code generation based on header files.\n- No evidence suggests any security concern or malware.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
