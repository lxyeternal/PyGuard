{
  "purpose": "The script parses NTSTATUS macro definitions from a header file, filters specific status codes, and appends corresponding constants to a Python module for use in code.",
  "sources": "Reads the header file (ntstatus_h) for macro definitions; reads the Python script (__init__.py) to locate the autogenerated marker line.",
  "sinks": "Writes updated lines with new constants into the Python script (__init__.py). No untrusted data sinks or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Parses lines from the header file (source), filters certain status codes, and appends formatted constant definitions to the list of lines (sink), then writes back to the Python file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses sys.exit() for error handling, which causes abrupt termination but is standard in CLI scripts; no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file reading, regex-based parsing of macro definitions, filtering based on naming patterns, and appending constants to a Python module. No malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is present. Error handling via sys.exit() is typical for scripts of this nature. The script's operations are deterministic and controlled, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for parsing header files and generating Python constants. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The minor security risk score of 0.1 assigned in one report is justified by the use of sys.exit(), but overall, the script is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
