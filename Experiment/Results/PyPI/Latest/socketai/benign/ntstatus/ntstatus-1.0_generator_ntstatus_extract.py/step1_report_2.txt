{
  "purpose": "The code parses a header file to extract NTSTATUS definitions and appends corresponding assignments to a Python script, automating the generation of status constants.",
  "sources": "Reads a file specified by command-line argument; reads and processes a Python script file located relative to the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "Writes back to a Python script file by appending lines with generated constants.",
  "flows": "Reads input file -> processes data -> modifies the Python script content -> writes back to the script file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code anomalies or obfuscated code detected. Use of sys.exit for error handling is standard but indicates abrupt termination; no hardcoded secrets or credentials present. No network activity, file exfiltration, or malicious actions observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file reading, regex-based parsing, and file writing. It avoids dangerous operations such as executing untrusted code, network access, or system modifications. It only reads specific files, processes lines with regex, and writes to a Python module. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors identified. The operations are typical of code generation or code maintenance scripts, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility script for managing NTSTATUS constants, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious network activity, or backdoors. Overall, the script is safe from a security perspective.",
