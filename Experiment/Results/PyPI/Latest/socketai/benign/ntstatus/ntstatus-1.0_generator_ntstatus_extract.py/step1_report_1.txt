{
  "purpose": "The script parses NTSTATUS definitions from a header file and generates corresponding Python code, automating the creation of status code constants.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a provided header file (ntstatus_h) and a script file (__init__.py).",
  "sinks": "Writes output to the __init__.py file, potentially overwriting existing code.",
  "flows": "Reads data from the input file, processes it, then writes the generated code into __init__.py.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regular expressions for parsing, which are standard; no suspicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a specified header file, extracts NTSTATUS definitions using regex, filters out certain status codes based on naming patterns, and then appends these as constants in a Python module. It also reads a script file to identify an autogenerated marker line, to insert new constants with proper indentation. The code relies on file I/O, regex parsing, and string manipulation with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no embedded network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The operations are standard file processing and code generation tasks. The code’s structure and logic are straightforward and do not involve obfuscation or dangerous functions.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard parsing and code generation tasks with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes input files to produce code constants, and all operations are benign in context. The code is clear, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
