{
  "purpose": "The script parses NTSTATUS macro definitions from a header file and generates corresponding Python variable assignments in an __init__.py file, automating the creation of constants for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a file specified by the user (ntstatus.h) and another file located relative to the script (__init__.py).",
  "sinks": "The script writes generated Python code into __init__.py, potentially overwriting or creating code with constant definitions.",
  "flows": "Input data from ntstatus.h is parsed to extract NTSTATUS values, which are then used to generate Python variable assignments in __init__.py, forming a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "The script appears to perform straightforward parsing and file writing with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by validating input files and reading their contents. It uses regex to parse specific macro definitions, excluding certain variants of NTSTATUS constants. The script then reads a Python file to locate an autogenerated section indicated by a specific comment, and appends new constant definitions to it. The process is purely file I/O and string manipulation without any dynamic code execution or external network activity. No suspicious code patterns, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate code generation utility for managing NTSTATUS constants in Python. It performs simple parsing and code generation tasks without any malicious intent or security risks.",
