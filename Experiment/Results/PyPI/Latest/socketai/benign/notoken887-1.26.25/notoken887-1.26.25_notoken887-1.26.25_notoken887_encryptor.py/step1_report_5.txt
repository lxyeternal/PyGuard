{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character-based substitution cipher encryption and decryption functions for strings.",
  "sources": "The methods read input strings via the parameters 'string' and 'encrypted_token'.",
  "sinks": "The code only performs string replacements within the methods; no external data sinks, network connections, or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via a series of replace calls in encrypt and decrypt; no external data flows or malicious command execution occur.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior are present. The substitution cipher is simplistic and does not provide real security; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a basic character replacement cipher, mapping characters to emojis and vice versa. It performs straightforward string replacements in both encrypt and decrypt functions. There are no external data inputs, no network operations, and no indication of malicious code or malicious intent. The code's structure is simple, and it functions solely as a reversible character substitution cipher. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The substitution cipher is insecure for serious security purposes but does not constitute malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple character substitution cipher with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not exhibit obfuscation, malware, or supply chain attacks. It is a benign utility for encoding and decoding strings, albeit insecure for sensitive data.",
