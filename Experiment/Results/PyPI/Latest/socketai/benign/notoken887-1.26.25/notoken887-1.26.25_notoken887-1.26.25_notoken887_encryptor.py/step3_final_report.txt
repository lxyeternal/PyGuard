{
  "purpose": "A reversible substitution cipher that encodes characters into emojis and special symbols for obfuscation or aesthetic purposes.",
  "sources": "Static character replacements within the encrypt and decrypt methods; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; the code only transforms input strings locally without data leakage or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input string → character replacements in encrypt method → output encrypted string; reverse in decrypt method.",
  "anomalies": "Use of emojis and special characters for substitution; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation beyond static replacements.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward, static character substitution cipher, replacing characters with emojis and vice versa. There are no external dependencies, network activity, or malicious behaviors. The substitution is reversible and serves as simple obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code is benign and intended for aesthetic or obfuscation purposes, not security. The implementation is clear, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple reversible substitution cipher primarily for obfuscation or aesthetic purposes. It poses no security threat or malware risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
