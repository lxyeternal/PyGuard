  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration with suspicious metadata that warrants caution. No malicious code or obfuscation is present in this script. The primary concern is metadata anomalies, which should prompt further review of the package contents, especially the 'main' module. The malware and obfuscated scores are 0; the security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3 due to metadata concerns."
