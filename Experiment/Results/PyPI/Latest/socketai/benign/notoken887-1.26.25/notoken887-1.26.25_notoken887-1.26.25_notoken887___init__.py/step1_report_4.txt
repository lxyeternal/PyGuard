  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple demonstration or utility involving standard input/output operations and possibly some basic data processing.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from the user via input() or reads data from files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Data is output to the console, written to files, or sent over network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and then to output sinks; untrusted input may influence output or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated or unusual language features. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving standard library usage with no evident malicious intent. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or dangerous functions. It does not include hardcoded secrets or perform insecure operations. Absence of suspicious network activity or privilege escalation routines.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign and does not contain malware or supply chain threats.",
