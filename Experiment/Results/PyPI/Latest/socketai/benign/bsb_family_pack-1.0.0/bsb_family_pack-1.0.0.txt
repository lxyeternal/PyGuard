      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The potential risk depends on the implementation of 'start_monitoring'. The inclusion of 'sqlite3' in 'install_requires' is a minor oversight but not malicious. Overall, the code is safe, and the security risk is minimal."
