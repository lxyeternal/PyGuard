  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Code reading environment variables, user inputs, network/system calls, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), obfuscated segments.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user inputs) to sinks (network, file system) via dynamic execution or obfuscated control flow.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores (~0.75), dynamic code execution, complex control flow, inconsistent suspicion levels, some signs of hiding malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent. The suspicion is supported by high obfuscation scores (~0.75) and moderate malware scores (~0.4-0.6). The lack of explicit malicious payloads or hardcoded secrets reduces certainty but warrants caution. Benign code shows no obfuscation or suspicious patterns, with scores at zero. Suspicious code with obfuscation and dynamic behavior justifies moderate scores, aligning with the overall risk assessment. The scores across reports are consistent with their descriptions, with adjustments favoring higher malware suspicion in obfuscated cases.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, indicating potential malicious intent. While no explicit payloads are confirmed, the high obfuscation and suspicious patterns justify a moderate to high security risk. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment.",
