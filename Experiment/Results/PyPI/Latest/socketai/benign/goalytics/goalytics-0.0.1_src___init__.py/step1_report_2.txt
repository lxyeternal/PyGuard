{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script performing some data processing or utility functions, with no immediately apparent malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the user via input prompts and possibly reads from external files if present, or environment variables (if used).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing to the console, writing to files, or network communication if present. No direct network or system calls are evident from the visible code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user input, environment variables, files) to processing functions and then to output sinks (console, files).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. No hidden backdoors or malicious payloads identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with clear input, processing, and output sections. There is no evidence of code injection, unsafe SQL, or data leakage. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No suspicious functions or data flows were observed. The code structure and format are typical for a benign utility script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility script without any signs of malware or sabotage.",
