  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious behavior, code logic, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Purpose: Calculate expected goals (xG) based on shot coordinates.\n- Methods: Per-shot xG calculation based on geometry, match total xG, average over matches, trend prediction via linear regression.\n- Libraries: numpy and sklearn.\n- Behavior: purely mathematical, no external communication, no data leakage, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Clear, benign sports analytics code. No malicious behavior.\n- **Security assessment:** No sinks, flows, anomalies, or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security risk: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Confidence: 1 (appropriate)  \n- **Conclusion:** Fully benign, straightforward code.  \n**Scores seem reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, detailed explanation, no malicious activity.\n- **Security assessment:** No external communication, no data leakage.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security risk: 0.1 (very low, possibly due to library use, but negligible)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Confidence: 1 (appropriate)  \n**Scores seem reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Clear, standard implementation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Security assessment:** No external sinks or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security risk: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Confidence: 1 (correct)  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Straightforward, no suspicious activity.\n- **Security assessment:** No external data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security risk: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Confidence: 1 (correct)  \n**Scores are consistent.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to others, no malicious intent.\n- **Security assessment:** No external communication, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security risk: 0.1 (very low, standard library use)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 (slightly less, but still reasonable)  \n**Scores are acceptable.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0 or 0.1), justified by the use of standard libraries and calculations.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 to 1, reflecting high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** **0.05** — negligible, due to library dependencies but no security concern.\n- **Justification:** The code is a transparent, mathematical model for football xG calculations, with no external data leaks, no network activity, no backdoors, and no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The scoring aligns well with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0.05** (or similar very low value)  \n\nThis reflects a safe, standard implementation of a sports analytics model.",
