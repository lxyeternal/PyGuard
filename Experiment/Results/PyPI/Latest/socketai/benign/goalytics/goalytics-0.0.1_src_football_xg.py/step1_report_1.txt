{
  "purpose": "The code models expected goals (xG) in football matches by calculating shot probabilities based on spatial data and trend prediction, primarily for analysis of match performance.",
  "sources": "Input data includes shot coordinates (x, y) for each shot and historical xG values for trend prediction.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any evident sinks that lead to data leakage, system compromise, or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input shot coordinates are used to compute individual shot xG, which are aggregated for match totals, and past xG data are used to predict future performance via simple averaging or linear regression.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code strictly performs mathematical calculations without external data transmission or system access.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for calculating expected goals using geometric and statistical methods, including coordinate-based probability estimates and trend predictions. It uses numpy and sklearn libraries for mathematical operations and linear regression. The example usage demonstrates typical analysis workflows. No malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation is present. The code structure is straightforward, and dependencies are standard scientific libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign sports analytics tool implementing statistical models for football shot analysis. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks are detected.",
