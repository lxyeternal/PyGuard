  "purpose": "Calculate expected goals (xG) in football matches based on shot coordinates, match data, and trend prediction using linear regression.",
  "sources": "Shot location data (x, y), past xG values for trend prediction.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data processed internally through geometric calculations and regression models.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code constructs, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs geometric calculations to estimate shot quality, aggregates xG over matches, and predicts future xG using simple averaging and linear regression. It relies solely on standard scientific libraries (numpy, sklearn). No external communication or malicious payloads are present. The implementation is straightforward, transparent, and aligns with typical sports analytics practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign sports analytics module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate given the context. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
