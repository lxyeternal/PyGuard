{
  "purpose": "The code models expected goals (xG) for football shots based on their coordinates and provides methods for calculating, averaging, and predicting future xG values.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as shot coordinates and past xG values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (shot coordinates, past xG values) through calculations to output predictions or total xG values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code primarily performs geometric calculations and simple linear regression for trend prediction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for modeling expected goals in football based on shot coordinates. It uses numpy for numerical operations and scikit-learn's LinearRegression for trend prediction. All data inputs are method parameters, with no apparent handling of external or untrusted sources. The calculations are straightforward, and the methods produce expected outputs for typical usage. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors are present. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of statistical modeling, with no security concerns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a clean, well-structured implementation for modeling expected goals in football matches. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The functions are standard and appropriate for their intended purpose.",
