{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to model and calculate expected goals (xG) in soccer matches based on shot coordinates and historical data.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters such as shot coordinates and historical xG arrays.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that lead to data leakage, system compromise, or malicious activity are present.",
  "flows": "Input shot coordinates flow into calculations for individual shot xG, then aggregate into match xG, and historical data is used for trend prediction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are detected. The code performs straightforward calculations without obfuscation or misleading constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class for calculating expected goals (xG) using geometric formulas based on shot positions. It includes methods for per-shot xG, match-level aggregation, and trend prediction via linear regression. No external network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code uses numpy and scikit-learn libraries solely for mathematical computations. The example usage demonstrates typical data processing without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a soccer xG model without any malicious intent, suspicious backdoors, or malware. It is a straightforward statistical model utilizing standard libraries, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
