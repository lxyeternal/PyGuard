{
  "purpose": "This code models expected goals (xG) in soccer matches using geometric calculations and linear regression to predict future performance.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from parameters (field dimensions, shot coordinates, past xG values) and lists of shot coordinates for matches.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involve untrusted data leading to data leaks, system commands, or external network connections.",
  "flows": "Input data (shot coordinates, past xG arrays) are processed within methods to compute xG values and predictions; no external data or untrusted sources are utilized in a way that affects system security.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or hidden functionalities observed. The code appears straightforward with comments and standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an ExpectedGoals class for soccer xG calculation based on shot locations. It computes individual shot probabilities, total match xG, average xG over multiple matches, and predictions for future matches using simple averages or trend-based linear regression. It employs numpy for mathematical operations and sklearn's LinearRegression for trend prediction. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. All data processing is purely mathematical and visualization-oriented. The code does not contain external network calls, file manipulations, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate soccer analytics tool that performs geometric and statistical calculations to estimate and predict expected goals. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious functionalities. It is safe for use and shows no signs of malware or security risks.",
