{
  "purpose": "The code calculates expected assists (xA) based on shot xG values, providing methods to compute total xA for a match and average xA across multiple matches.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: 'shot_xg' (single shot's xG), 'passes_shot_xg' (list of shot xG values), and 'matches_passes_shot_xg' (list of lists of shot xG values).",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations using standard Python and numpy functions, returning numerical results; no data is sent over networks or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Input data (shot_xg, passes_shot_xg, matches_passes_shot_xg) flow into calculation functions, which process and return numerical summaries (total and average xA).",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, hidden code, or unusual behaviors. The code uses straightforward calculations and standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for calculating expected assists based on shot xG values. It uses numpy for clipping and averaging. The functions are simple and do not handle external input sources beyond parameters. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data flows are present. The only potential concern is that the code does not include input validation or error handling, but this does not indicate malicious intent. The commented-out usage example is safe and unrelated to malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a statistical model for expected assists with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured piece of analysis code.",
