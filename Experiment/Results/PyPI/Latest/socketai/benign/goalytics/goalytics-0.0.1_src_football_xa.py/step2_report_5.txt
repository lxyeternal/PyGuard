  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential security issues, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, implementing a simple statistical model for expected assists based on shot xG values.\n- It uses standard Python and numpy functions, with no external data sources, network operations, or file I/O.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors, are present.\n- The commented-out usage examples are benign and serve illustrative purposes.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or external dependencies that could be exploited are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** perform input validation or error handling (e.g., handling non-numeric inputs or invalid data), but this is typical for such analytical scripts and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The code is correct for its purpose; no logical errors are evident.\n- Lack of input validation could lead to runtime errors if misused, but this does not impact security or maliciousness.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n\n#### Malware score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent.\n- No malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n\n#### Obfuscated score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, transparent code.\n\n#### Security risk score:\n- All reports assign 0 or 0.9, with the latter being slightly higher but still indicating minimal concern.\n- Given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions, a score of 0 or very close to 0 is justified.\n\n#### Risk score:\n- All reports assign a low risk score (mostly 0 or 0.1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the code as safe, with no external dependencies or insecure practices.\n\n- **Are the scores consistent with the code?**  \n  Yes. All reports are consistent, reflecting the benign, analytical nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for lack of input validation, but not malicious)  \n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a transparent, standard implementation of a statistical model with no malicious or suspicious elements. The minor risk score reflects that input validation could be improved but does not indicate security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe code is benign. The assigned scores are appropriate. I would maintain or slightly adjust the risk score to 0.1 for completeness, but overall, the security posture is very low risk.",
