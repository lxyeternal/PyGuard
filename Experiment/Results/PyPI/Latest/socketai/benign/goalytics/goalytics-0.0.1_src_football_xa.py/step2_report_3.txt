  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of a football analytics model to compute expected assists (xA) based on shot xG values.\n- All reports consistently identify that the code reads input via function parameters, performs simple calculations using numpy, and does not involve external data sources, network, or file operations.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected, such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n- The code is well-structured, with clear functions and comments, and no evidence of malware, backdoors, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports agree that the code is benign, simple, and safe. No malicious or suspicious elements are found.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The reports do not identify any logical errors or flaws in the code.  \n- The only minor point is that input validation or error handling isn't present, but this isn't malicious—just a potential area for robustness improvement.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n\n### Risk scores:\n- The reports' overall risk scores are all very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n### Justification for scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since the code is purely computational with no malicious behavior, scores higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The malware score should remain 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain 0.\n- The overall security risk should remain 0.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code is simple and transparent.\n- No external dependencies or behaviors that could be malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a benign, transparent implementation of a sports analytics calculation. It does not perform any malicious actions, does not contain obfuscation, and does not handle untrusted data in a way that could cause harm.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Score | Justification                                               |\n|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0            | No malicious code, network activity, or hidden behaviors.  |\n| Obfuscated         | 0            | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.            |\n| Security Risk      | 0            | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious intent.       |\n\nThis aligns with all reports and the code's actual behavior.\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose. No adjustments needed.",
