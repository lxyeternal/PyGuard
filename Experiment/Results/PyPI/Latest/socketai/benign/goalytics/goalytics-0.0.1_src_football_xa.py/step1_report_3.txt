  "purpose": "The code models expected assists (xA) calculations for soccer matches, including per-pass, per-match, and average match calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters: 'shot_xg', 'passes_shot_xg', and 'matches_passes_shot_xg'. No external data sources or user input are used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs beyond standard calculations; no network, file, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through calculation functions without external transmission or manipulation; no data flows to untrusted sources or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hard-coded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code performs straightforward statistical calculations using numpy, with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script implements a simple class to calculate expected assists based on shot xG values. It includes methods for per-pass, per-match, and overall average calculations. The calculations rely solely on numeric input and the numpy library for clipping and averaging. There are no indications of malicious activity, such as network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The code appears well-structured, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The commented-out test code demonstrates usage but does not introduce any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation for soccer analytics, performing statistical calculations without any malicious intent or security risks. There are no signs of malware, data leakage, or malicious behaviors.",
