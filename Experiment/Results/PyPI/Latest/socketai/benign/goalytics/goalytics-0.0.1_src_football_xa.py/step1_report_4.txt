{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple expected assists (xA) model for football analytics, calculating xA based on shot xG values.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from lists of shot xG values provided to functions like calculate_match_xa and calculate_average_xa.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write or transmit data externally or untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input lists to calculations within class methods; no external data transmission or untrusted source influence identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures detected. The code is straightforward, mathematical, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for calculating expected assists metrics using numpy for numerical operations. It processes input lists of shot xG values, computes per-pass xA via clipping, sums for match totals, and averages over multiple matches. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The code functions as a simple analytical model without external data transmission, code injection, or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, intended solely for calculating football metrics. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified. The code's purpose is clear, and there are no suspicious elements.",
