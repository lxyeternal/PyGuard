  "purpose": "To calculate expected assists (xA) metrics for football match data, including per-pass, per-match, and across multiple matches.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters: shot_xg, passes_shot_xg, matches_passes_shot_xg.",
  "sinks": "Returns numerical calculations; no untrusted data output or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through calculation methods, resulting in numerical summaries; no data leaks or external effects identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of numpy for mathematical operations is standard. The commented-out example code is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for computing expected assists metrics using straightforward mathematical operations. All functions process provided numerical data without external data fetching, network operations, or file I/O. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation for sports analytics calculations. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
