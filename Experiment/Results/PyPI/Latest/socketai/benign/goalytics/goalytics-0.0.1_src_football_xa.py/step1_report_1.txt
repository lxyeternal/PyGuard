{
  "purpose": "This code implements a model to calculate expected assists (xA) in football matches based on shot xG values, aggregating per pass, per match, and across multiple matches.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through function parameters: 'shot_xg' in 'calculate_pass_xa' and 'passes_shot_xg'/'matches_passes_shot_xg' in the other functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is transmitted, stored, or used in a way that leads to data leaks or system compromise. The code does not perform network operations, file handling, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input shot xG values flow through 'calculate_pass_xa' to compute per-pass xA, then summed in 'calculate_match_xa' for total match xA, and averaged across matches in 'calculate_average_xa'. No external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and typical for statistical calculations; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. Commented-out code is benign and typical for testing or demonstration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for calculating expected assists in football analytics. All functions use standard numpy operations, such as np.clip and np.mean, without obfuscation or dynamic code execution. No external data sources or network activity are present. The logic is simple, transparent, and safe. No anomalies, malicious instructions, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a football analytics model with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard data processing tasks without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
