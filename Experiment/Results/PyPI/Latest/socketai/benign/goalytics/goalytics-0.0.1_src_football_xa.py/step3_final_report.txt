  "purpose": "This code implements a simple model to calculate expected assists (xA) based on shot xG values, aggregating per pass, match, and across multiple matches.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as shot_xg in calculate_pass_xa, passes_shot_xg in calculate_match_xa, and matches_passes_shot_xg in calculate_average_xa.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed internally without network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through calculation functions, with pass xG values processed to compute total and average xA.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. The code is transparent and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code uses numpy for numerical operations, with clear functions for computing per-pass xA, total match xA, and average across matches. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The logic is simple, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. Input validation is absent but does not imply malicious intent. The code is well-structured, comments clarify purpose, and no suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, transparent implementation of a sports analytics model with no malicious or security concerns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero. The overall assessment indicates a safe, straightforward script with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
