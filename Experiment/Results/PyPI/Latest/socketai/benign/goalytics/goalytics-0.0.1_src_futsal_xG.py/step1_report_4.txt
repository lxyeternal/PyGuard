{
  "purpose": "The code models expected goals (xG) for futsal matches, calculating shot quality based on coordinates, and predicting future match xG using simple averaging or linear regression trend analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: shot coordinates in 'calculate_shot_xg' and lists of past xG values in 'predict_future_xg' and 'predict_trend_xg'.",
  "sinks": "The code performs no data transmission, external network calls, or data storage; all calculations are performed locally within functions, with no suspicious or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Input data (shot coordinates or past xG arrays) flows into functions; calculations produce xG values or predictions which are returned. No untrusted data is sent elsewhere or stored externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard for modeling expected goals; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for futsal xG modeling, with methods to compute shot-based xG, aggregate over matches, and predict future xG using average or linear regression. The functions operate on numerical data inputs without external dependencies beyond numpy and sklearn. There are no network calls, data leaks, or malicious behavior, and no code anomalies. All calculations are performed locally, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, domain-specific model for futsal expected goals calculation and prediction. It contains no malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage mechanisms. It is safe for use from a security perspective.",
