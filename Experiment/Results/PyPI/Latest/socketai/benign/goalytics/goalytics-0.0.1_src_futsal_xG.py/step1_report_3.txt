{
  "purpose": "This code defines a model for calculating expected goals (xG) in futsal matches, including methods for shot-based xG calculation, match-level aggregation, and future predictions using simple averaging and linear regression.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters such as shot coordinates, past xG values, and match data provided as lists or arrays.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks that handle untrusted input data for potentially malicious actions. No data is sent over networks or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input shot coordinates are processed within class methods to compute xG values; past xG data is used for prediction. The flow is contained within the methods, with no external data flows or output manipulations beyond local calculations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code primarily performs mathematical calculations and statistical predictions without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured, focusing on statistical modeling for sports analytics. It uses standard libraries (numpy, sklearn) for numerical operations and regression. The calculations are straightforward and do not involve external data fetching, code execution, or network operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate sports analytics tool for futsal, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe for use in its stated purpose. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
