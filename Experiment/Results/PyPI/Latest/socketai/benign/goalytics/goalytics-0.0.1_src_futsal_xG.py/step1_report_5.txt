{
  "purpose": "The code models expected goals (xG) for futsal matches, calculating xG based on shot coordinates, averaging across matches, and predicting future xG values using simple averages and linear regression trends.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as shot coordinates, past xG values, and match data structures.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data externally; it performs internal calculations and outputs results via print statements, which are commented out. No external data sinks or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "Input shot coordinates flow into calculate_shot_xg, then aggregate into match xG, which feeds into average and prediction functions. Past xG values are used directly for predictions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and primarily numerical calculations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script implements a simple mathematical model for futsal xG calculations, utilizing numpy for computations and scikit-learn's LinearRegression for trend prediction. It handles typical data inputs (shot coordinates, past xG values) and performs standard statistical and geometric calculations. There are no signs of malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscated or misleading constructs. The commented-out example usage does not contain any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward modeling tool for futsal expected goals with no indication of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It performs numerical calculations and predictions without external communication or harmful operations.",
