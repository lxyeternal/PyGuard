  "purpose": "Model expected goals (xG) for futsal based on shot position, aggregate match data, and predict future xG using simple average or linear regression.",
  "sources": "Shot coordinate inputs, past xG values, match data arrays",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, file I/O, or network activity; computations are local",
  "flows": "Input shot data and past xG values flow into calculation and prediction functions, producing aggregate and trend outputs",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual control flow detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs geometric calculations for shot quality, aggregates data across matches, and applies standard statistical models (mean, linear regression). It uses numpy and sklearn libraries appropriately. No external communication or malicious patterns are present. The logic is straightforward, domain-specific, and transparent, with no signs of obfuscation or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, domain-specific implementation of a futsal expected goals model. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data leaks, and no obfuscation. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero.",
