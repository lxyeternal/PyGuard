  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for potential issues, and evaluate the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of a sports analytics model for futsal expected goals.\n- It uses standard libraries (numpy, sklearn) for mathematical operations and regression.\n- No external data transmission, file I/O, or network activity is present.\n- The logic is transparent, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- The functions operate solely on input data, with no hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- The predictions are based on simple statistical methods (average, linear regression).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on the code:\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  The code appears correct and free of bugs or security flaws. The mathematical calculations are standard, and the regression approach is typical.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors:**  \n  None are evident. The code does not perform any network operations, file writes, or code execution beyond numerical computations.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly describe the code's intent and data sources.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior observed.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Accurate, aligns with the code.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n  - Security risk: 0 — no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriate.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Same observations as above; the analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Same consistent reasoning.\n- No suspicious behavior, no external communication.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Same reasoning applies; the code is straightforward.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not contain any malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final expert estimation:\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports' evaluations are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a transparent, standard implementation of a futsal xG model, with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**End of review.**",
