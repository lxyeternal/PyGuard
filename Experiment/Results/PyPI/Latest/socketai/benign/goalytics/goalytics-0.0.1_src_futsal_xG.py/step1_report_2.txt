{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to model and predict expected goals (xG) for futsal matches based on shot coordinates and statistical trends.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: shot coordinates (x, y), lists of shot data for matches, and past xG values.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources, network, or files. It returns numerical predictions and calculations internally.",
  "flows": "Input data (shot coordinates, past xG values) flow into calculation functions, which process and output xG values and predictions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses standard mathematical and statistical libraries in a typical manner.",
  "analysis": "The code performs mathematical computations to estimate xG based on shot coordinates, utilizing trigonometry and linear regression. It does not include any suspicious or unusual code structures. No external data or network connections are made, and there are no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The code's structure and logic are straightforward, focusing solely on statistical modeling of futsal shot data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for sports analytics. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It uses standard libraries and techniques without any suspicious activity.",
