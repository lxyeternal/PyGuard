{
  "purpose": "The code models expected goals (xG) for futsal matches, providing functions to calculate shot quality, aggregate match xG, and predict future xG values using simple averages and linear regression.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input lists of shot coordinates and past xG values; uses numpy functions for mathematical calculations and linear regression from sklearn.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external systems, network, or files; no outputs are directed to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input shot coordinates flow through calculate_shot_xg to produce shot xG, then aggregate to match xG, and further to average or trend prediction functions for future xG estimates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The code performs standard mathematical and statistical operations without obfuscation or hidden logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class for futsal xG modeling, utilizing mathematical calculations based on shot position, angle, and distance. It employs numpy for mathematical functions and sklearn's LinearRegression for trend analysis. The methods are straightforward and consistent with typical modeling tasks. The example usage code is commented out and only demonstrates typical calculations. No external network connections, file operations, or hidden behaviors are present. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a sports analytics model with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected calculations and predictions securely, with no anomalous or malicious behaviors.",
