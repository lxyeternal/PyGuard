      "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, indicating potential malicious intent. While no explicit payloads are confirmed, the high obfuscation and suspicious patterns justify a moderate to high security risk. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment."

The overall assessment indicates low to moderate risk, with high suspicion only in specific cases. Scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary at this stage."
