{
  "purpose": "The code defines a model for calculating expected assists (xA) in futsal matches, including methods for per-pass, per-match, and across-matches calculations.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'shot_xg' values for individual passes and lists of such values for multiple matches.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks such as network communication, file writing, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (shot_xg values) through calculations, resulting in numerical summaries (total or average xA). No external data or outputs are directed to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The numpy library is used solely for numerical operations and clipping, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a futsal xA model. It initializes with field dimensions but does not utilize them in calculations. Methods process input lists to compute total and average xA scores, employing numpy for clipping and averaging. No external or suspicious activities are detected. The code appears to serve a statistical or analytical purpose without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a futsal expected assists model. It performs simple calculations with standard libraries and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
