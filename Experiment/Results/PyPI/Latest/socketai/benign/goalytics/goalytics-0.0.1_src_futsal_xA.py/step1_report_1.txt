{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class for calculating expected assists (xA) in futsal matches, focusing on sports analytics rather than security functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from method parameters: shot_xg, passes_shot_xg, and matches_passes_shot_xg.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data leading to data leaks or security effects; no external data transmission or sensitive data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (shot_xg, passes_shot_xg, matches_passes_shot_xg) are processed within class methods to compute total and average xA values; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward without suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No unusual or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple, transparent sports analytics calculation using numpy for numerical operations. It does not perform any data transmission, system modification, or privilege escalation. All data used are numerical inputs, and no external dependencies or network operations are involved. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or anomalies. It strictly focuses on mathematical computations related to sports data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for calculating expected assists in futsal matches. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
