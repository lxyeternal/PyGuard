{
  "purpose": "The code implements a model to calculate expected assists (xA) in futsal matches based on shot xG values, providing methods to compute total and average xA across matches.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method parameters such as shot_xg, passes_shot_xg, and matches_passes_shot_xg, which are externally provided lists of numerical values.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources, send data over networks, or manipulate files. No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (lists of floats) through calculation methods where np.clip and np.mean are applied, culminating in returned numerical results. No untrusted data is processed in a way that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward, with proper use of numpy functions for numerical operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple numerical model for calculating expected assists in futsal, utilizing numpy for calculations and basic class methods for encapsulation. All data inputs are numerical and originate externally, with no indication of malicious intent or harmful operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured implementation of a sports analytics model. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It simply processes numerical data for sports analytics purposes.",
