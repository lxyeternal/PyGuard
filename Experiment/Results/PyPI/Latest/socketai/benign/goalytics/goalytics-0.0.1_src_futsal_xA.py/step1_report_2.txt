{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python class for modeling expected assists (xA) in futsal matches, calculating xA based on shot xG values, and aggregating these metrics across matches.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through method parameters: shot_xg, passes_shot_xg, and matches_passes_shot_xg.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks involving untrusted data leading to data leaks, system effects, or external communications.",
  "flows": "Input data (shot_xg and passes_shot_xg) are processed through class methods to compute match and average xA; no external data flow or transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code performs straightforward calculations with numpy.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a class for futsal xA calculations with clear methods for individual pass xA, match total xA, and average xA across matches. It uses numpy functions appropriately. No external system calls, network activity, or suspicious logic are observed. The data processing is internal and straightforward, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard statistical calculation module for futsal expected assists, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It is safe for use in sports analytics applications.",
