  "purpose": "A Python class for calculating expected assists (xA) in futsal matches based on shot xG values, providing total and average xA metrics.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (shot_xg, passes_shot_xg, matches_passes_shot_xg)",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs internal calculations only without external data transmission or storage.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through calculation methods; no external data flows or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "Unused parameters (field_length, field_width) are initialized but not utilized; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of sports analytics calculations using numpy. It does not handle external data sources, perform network operations, or manipulate system files. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The logic is simple, transparent, and purpose-specific. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify these scores, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, transparent sports analytics module with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
