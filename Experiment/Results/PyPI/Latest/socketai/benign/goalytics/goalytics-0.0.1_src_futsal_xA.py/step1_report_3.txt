{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for calculating expected assists (xA) in futsal matches based on shot xG values, providing methods to compute total and average xA metrics.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters: shot_xg in calculate_pass_xa, passes_shot_xg in calculate_match_xa, and matches_passes_shot_xg in calculate_average_xa.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources, send data over the network, or access environment variables. It only performs in-memory calculations and prints output.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method arguments through calculations, with no external data or network interactions; results are returned and printed locally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code uses numpy for numerical operations, which is standard. No obfuscation or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a futsal xA model using numpy. It initializes parameters, processes lists of xG values, and computes aggregate metrics. No external data or unsafe operations detected. The print statements are standard for demonstration and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, purpose-driven implementation of a statistical model for futsal metrics. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious activities are evident.",
