{
  "purpose": "The code defines a model to calculate expected threat (xT) in futsal matches, analyzing player actions and their impact on scoring likelihood based on field position.",
  "sources": "The code reads positional input data for actions (start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y) and uses them to determine threat levels.",
  "sinks": "The code performs internal calculations and outputs numerical xT scores; no external data sinks or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "Input coordinates are converted into threat grid cells, and the threat difference between start and end positions is calculated to determine action impact; these are aggregated over matches.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or hidden backdoors are present. The code relies solely on mathematical computations and data processing within the numpy library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy for numerical operations, initializes a threat grid based on a model of threat distribution on a futsal field, and provides methods to convert real coordinates to grid indices. It calculates threat gains for individual actions and aggregates these across matches. The implementation appears straightforward, with no indications of obfuscated code or malicious intent. It does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or external system calls that could indicate malicious activity. The only external dependency is numpy, which is standard for such numerical modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate modeling tool for futsal expected threat calculations. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It purely performs positional threat analysis without any suspicious side effects or external data leaks.",
