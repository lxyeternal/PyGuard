{
  "purpose": "The code implements a futsal-specific expected threat (xT) model to evaluate actions and calculate threat scores based on player movements and actions within the pitch.",
  "sources": "The code reads parameters for field dimensions and action coordinates from function inputs and internal variables; uses numpy for numerical computations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks, network connections, or data exfiltration points are present; no sensitive data processing or external communications are observed.",
  "flows": "Input coordinates are converted into grid cells; threat values are calculated and differences are summed for match-level and overall analyses.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden functionalities are detected. The code uses standard numerical operations and data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for modeling threat levels in a futsal game, utilizing numpy for matrix operations. It generates a normalized threat grid based on distance from the goal, converts real coordinates into grid indices, and calculates threat differences for actions and matches. No network or system manipulation, obfuscated code, or malicious intent are evident. The code performs domain-specific calculations with clear, understandable logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a futsal threat model with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as a mathematical and data processing tool for sports analytics.",
