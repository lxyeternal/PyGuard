{
  "purpose": "The code implements a model to calculate expected threat (xT) in a futsal game based on player actions, generating threat grids and computing threat differences for movements.",
  "sources": "Input data includes coordinates of actions (start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y) for individual moves or sequences, provided directly as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects. No network, file, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input coordinates are converted into grid cell indices, threat values are retrieved from a generated threat grid, and threat differences are computed to measure action quality. The data flows from input coordinates to threat calculations and aggregations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code constructs, obfuscated logic, or hardcoded secrets are observed. The code uses standard library (numpy) and straightforward calculations; no dynamic code execution or external dependencies that could hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for modeling threat levels on a futsal pitch, with methods to generate a threat grid, map real coordinates to grid cells, and calculate expected threat gains for actions and matches. It normalizes threat values and provides functions for aggregating threat over multiple actions or matches. All operations are deterministic and intended for statistical analysis, with no signs of malicious or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a sports analytics model with no malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on numerical data, performs no network or system modifications, and uses common Python practices. There is no evidence of malware or security threats.",
