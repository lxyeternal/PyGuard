{
  "purpose": "The code defines an ExpectedThreat (xT) model to evaluate threat levels on a football field based on player actions, generating threat grids and calculating threat metrics for match analysis.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters (coordinates of actions) within methods such as _get_cell, calculate_action_xt, and calculate_match_xt.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that send untrusted data externally or perform harmful operations. The code mainly processes input coordinates internally.",
  "flows": "Coordinates are input into _get_cell, which maps them to grid indices; these indices are used to retrieve threat levels from the threat grid; threat differences are computed in calculate_action_xt; cumulative threat metrics are derived in calculate_match_xt and calculate_average_xt.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or unusual constructs. No external calls, network operations, or system modifications are present. The threat grid is generated internally with a simple formula, which is typical for such models.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a threat grid based on positional data and computes threat differences for actions during a football match. It uses numpy for matrix operations and straightforward logic for grid indexing and threat calculation. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The code is clean, well-structured, and purpose-specific, with no suspicious behaviors or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code implements a benign model for calculating expected threat levels in football match analysis. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and appears to be a legitimate, purpose-driven implementation.",
