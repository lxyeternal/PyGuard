  "purpose": "The code implements a spatial threat model for football match analysis, calculating expected threat (xT) based on player actions and threat grid values.",
  "sources": "Input coordinates for actions (start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y) and internal threat grid generation.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; computations are internal, involving numerical operations on input data and threat grid values.",
  "flows": "Coordinates are mapped to grid cells, threat values are retrieved from the threat grid, and differences are accumulated to compute total xT.",
  "anomalies": "The import of sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression is unused, which is unnecessary clutter but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward spatial threat model with internally generated threat grid, coordinate mapping, and threat difference calculations. No external communication, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The logic is transparent and purpose-specific. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The threat grid formula is simple and interpretable. The unused sklearn import is a minor inefficiency but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purpose-specific, and free of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs internal computations for threat modeling without external interactions. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate. Minor adjustments could be made to the security risk score in report 5 to reflect its benign nature, setting it to 0 for consistency.",
