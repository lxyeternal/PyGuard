  "purpose": "The code implements an Expected Threat (xT) model to evaluate football match actions based on spatial threat levels, used for analysis of match strategies.",
  "sources": "Reads input coordinates of actions (start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y) from provided data structures and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Calculates threat differences; no direct data leaks or external system interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Input coordinates are mapped to threat grid cells, then threat levels are computed and aggregated across actions and matches.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious data handling, or unusual code behavior detected. Use of numpy and sklearn libraries are standard and not suspicious by themselves.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to generate a threat grid and compute threat metrics based on positional data. It processes coordinate inputs, maps them to grid cells, and computes differences in threat levels for actions. The code uses numpy for array operations, which is standard for such spatial analyses. No external data sources, network communication, or file operations are present. The code appears focused on statistical modeling for sports analytics, with no signs of malicious intent. All functions and variables are clear, and there is no obfuscated or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an Expected Threat model for sports analytics. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely within its defined scope, using open-source libraries for mathematical operations.",
