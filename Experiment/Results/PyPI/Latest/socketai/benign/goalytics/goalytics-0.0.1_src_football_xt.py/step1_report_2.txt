  "purpose": "This code defines a class for modeling expected threat (xT) in a football match based on player actions and generates threat grids for analysis.",
  "sources": "Data is read from method parameters (start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y) passed to calculate_action_xt, calculate_match_xt, and calculate_average_xt functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code performs calculations based on input data without writing or transmitting data outside the scope.",
  "flows": "Input coordinates flow from input parameters to internal methods which map them onto threat grid indices, then compute threat differences and aggregate results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed; no hardcoded credentials, no network calls, no obfuscation, and no hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a threat grid normalized between 0 and 1, then computes the difference in threat levels between start and end positions of actions. It sums these differences across actions to quantify total threat contribution in a match, and averages across multiple matches. All operations are standard mathematical and data processing routines with no external interactions or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a sports analytics model for expected threat calculation. It contains no malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies. It is safe and serves its analytical purpose effectively.",
