{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility that retrieves and displays environment variables and performs basic string operations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ, input() functions, and potentially reading files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential output functions like print(), logging, or writing to files; also data transmitted over network if such code exists.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs through string processing functions, then to output or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network connections, and no unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads environment variables and user input, processes strings, and outputs results. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or code that manipulates system files maliciously. No evidence of obfuscation or concealed malicious logic. The structure appears straightforward, with standard Python practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a benign utility for handling environment variables and user input, with no indications of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
