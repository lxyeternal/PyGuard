  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of code content provided. It may be intended for a Python package function or utility, but the specific purpose cannot be determined without the actual code.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, input functions, or potentially external files if present. Without specific code, the source analysis cannot be concretely identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, subprocess executions, or file writes if implemented. No explicit sinks are visible without code content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network or file operations. Due to missing code, no concrete flows can be identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns can be identified without the actual code content. Absence of code prevents detection of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited by the lack of provided code. Based on the instructions, a thorough step-by-step analysis cannot be performed without code content. No patterns indicating malicious activity or security issues are observable without the code text.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to determine the purpose, data flow, or security posture of the code. No evidence of malicious behavior can be identified from the absence of code provided.",
