  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the absence or presence of suspicious activity, with Report 4 justifying elevated scores due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution. The overall assessment indicates low to moderate risk, with high suspicion only in specific cases. Scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary at this stage."
