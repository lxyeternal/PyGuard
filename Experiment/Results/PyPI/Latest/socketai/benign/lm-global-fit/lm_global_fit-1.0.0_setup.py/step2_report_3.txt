  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Review of the provided code:**\n   - The code appears to be a standard `setup.py` configuration for a Python package named \"lm_global_fit\".\n   - It includes typical fields: name, version, author info, description, URL, packages, modules, dependencies, classifiers, and Python version requirement.\n   - No obvious malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present in this setup script.\n   - The code does not contain any embedded malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Assessment of the reports:**\n   - All five reports are empty responses with no details provided.\n   - This suggests either a failure in report generation or that no issues were identified or reported.\n\n3. **Logical evaluation:**\n   - Since the reports contain no information, there's no evidence of vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious intent.\n   - The absence of detailed reports makes it impossible to confirm or deny specific issues.\n\n4. **Scores and justification:**\n   - **Malware score:** Given the code and the lack of any suspicious activity, the malware score should be very low, close to 0.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward, so obfuscation is not present; score should be 0.\n   - **Risk score:** Without any identified issues, the risk score should also be near 0, unless there are underlying concerns not evident here.\n\n5. **Potential concerns:**\n   - The only minor concern could be the reading of `README.md` without a try-except block, but this is standard practice and unlikely to be malicious.\n   - The code is a typical setup script with no signs of tampering or malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Final recommendations:**\n   - Based on the provided information, the scores should be:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Risk: 0\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code appears safe and standard.\n- The reports are empty, providing no evidence of issues.\n- Scores should reflect no detected threats or obfuscation.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or additional information becomes available.",
