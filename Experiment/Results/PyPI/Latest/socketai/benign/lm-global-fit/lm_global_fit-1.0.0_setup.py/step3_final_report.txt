{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'lm_global_fit' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and description files; no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the script only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward and conventional setup script with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools, with no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. All reports are empty, indicating no issues or concerns raised. The code reads a README file, defines dependencies, and package metadata, all in a standard manner. No signs of malicious activity, such as network communication, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The absence of reports and the simplicity of the code suggest a benign package with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The empty reports and straightforward code support a benign assessment. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be minimal, reflecting no detected threats.",
