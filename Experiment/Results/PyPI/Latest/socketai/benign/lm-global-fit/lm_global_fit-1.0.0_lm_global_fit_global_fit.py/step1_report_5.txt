{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python package for nonlinear least squares fitting using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, including data simulation, multi-dataset handling, parallel computation, and bootstrap confidence interval calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads data inputs from 'data' dictionaries, including 'x', 'y', 'ye' sequences; accesses model functions; reads options from the options dict; retrieves environment variables (if any indirectly via external functions).",
  "sinks": "Uses reconstructed parameters to evaluate model functions; does not execute system commands or write files; does not perform network communication; manipulates numpy arrays for modeling; applies constraints and computes errors; no code injection or external data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Reads data from inputs, passes parameters to model functions, computes residuals and costs, updates parameters via LM iterations, applies constraints, computes covariance and errors, generates fitted and component curves, performs bootstrap sampling for CI, and outputs results. No external network or command flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded error thresholds; uses numerical regularization; extensive use of warnings for non-finite values; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code structures; detailed debug logs are optional via callbacks; no hidden code or environment variable leaks; no suspicious dynamic code execution or system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a comprehensive fitting library with standard numerical techniques, including error handling and parallelization. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote communication, or sabotage are evident. Functions operate solely on provided data, model functions, and options. The code maintains data privacy within memory, does not evaluate or execute untrusted code dynamically, and does not access environment variables or files. It uses numpy and scipy for numerical computations, which are safe in this context. No suspicious anomalies, backdoors, or covert channels are identified. The logging functions are default no-ops or controlled via user callbacks, with no hidden behavior. The code structure and logic are consistent with scientific computation and statistical modeling, with no malicious signals detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of a nonlinear least squares fitting and simulation package with advanced features like bootstrap CI and parallel execution. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks. The extensive error handling and structured design suggest it is intended for scientific use without hidden or malicious intent.",
