  "purpose": "This code implements a comprehensive Python-based framework for nonlinear least squares fitting using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, including data simulation, parallel execution, bootstrap confidence intervals, and parameter management. Its main goal is to perform robust model fitting and statistical analysis on datasets, supporting complex models and constraints.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays ('x', 'y', 'ye') from the data dictionary, user-provided model functions, initial parameter guesses, options, and constraints. Uses data structures and function parameters for internal residual and Jacobian computations, as well as data resampling in bootstrap workers.",
  "sinks": "Uses user-provided callback functions 'onLog' and 'onProgress' to output logs and progress information, potentially on external systems. Reads parameters and options to control model evaluation and constraints. No data leakage or sensitive information handling is apparent.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input arrays and parameters; residuals, Jacobians, and cost functions flow through the LM optimization; bootstrap samples are generated and fitted; residuals and parameter errors flow into confidence interval calculations; logs and progress reports flow into user callbacks. No external network communication or untrusted data flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. No suspicious data leaks or unusual code patterns are identified. The code performs standard numerical and parallel processing functions, with typical logging and exception handling. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables are found. All data processing appears consistent with intended statistical analysis. Functions for data simulation include noise addition but no malicious data manipulation. No hidden commands or code that could compromise system security are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly handles numerical computations, data management, and parallel execution for model fitting and statistical analysis. It employs standard Python libraries and clear function structures. No signs of malicious behavior such as unauthorized system access, data exfiltration, network communication, or code sabotage are evident. The 'onLog' and 'onProgress' callbacks are designed for user-defined logging, which could potentially be misused to leak data if user-supplied functions are malicious, but in standard usage this is not inherently suspicious. The bootstrap workers perform resampling and fitting, with no indications of data theft or reverse shells. Exception handling is used for robustness. The simulation function generates data with optional noise but does not include any malicious payload or unauthorized operations. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate scientific/statistical data fitting library without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code performs complex data fitting, simulation, and statistical inference with extensive support for parallel processing and constraints. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms. While user-provided callback functions could be misused for data leaks or privacy violations if malicious, the code itself is designed for standard numerical and statistical tasks. The overall security risk is very low, with no active malicious signals detected.",
