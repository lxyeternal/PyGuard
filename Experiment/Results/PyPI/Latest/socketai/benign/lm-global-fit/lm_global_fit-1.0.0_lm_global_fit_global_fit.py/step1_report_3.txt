{
  "purpose": "The code implements a comprehensive Python package for nonlinear least-squares fitting using Levenberg-Marquardt, including data simulation, parameter management, parallel execution, bootstrap confidence intervals, and model evaluation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function arguments, especially data['x'], data['y'], data['ye']. Model functions are provided externally as callables. Environment variables are not accessed. Data is received via parameters; no explicit external input sources or file reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for executing untrusted data; all data is handled as numpy arrays or callables. The code performs numerical calculations, residuals, Jacobian, and covariance matrix computations, but does not execute code from untrusted sources or external code strings. No network operations or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal computations, residual and cost calculations, Jacobian evaluations, and parameter updates. The parameter reconstruction, constraints, and residual calculations form source-to-sink flows, but all data are within controlled functions. The bootstrap worker and main function pass data internally and do not invoke external code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are present. The code uses standard mathematical and data handling functions. All functions perform expected numerical or data processing. The only unusual aspect is extensive logging and parallel processing which are legitimate in such context.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step, the code manages parameters, performs model evaluations, computes residuals, Jacobians, covariance matrices, and conducts optimization via LM algorithm. It incorporates parallel execution and bootstrap CI estimation. No external network access, code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. All data handling is within controlled numerical computations. The functions do not include code injection, system modification, or malicious data leaks. Use of environment variables or system info is not observed. Logging functions are no-op or controlled. The design follows typical scientific Python packages with no suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific computation package for model fitting, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates solely on numerical data, callables, and parallel processing, without external malicious influences. No malware signals detected. Overall security risk is very low.",
