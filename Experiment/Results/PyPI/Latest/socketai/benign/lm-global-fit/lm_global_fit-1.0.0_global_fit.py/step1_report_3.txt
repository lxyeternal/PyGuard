  "purpose": "The code performs Python-based nonlinear least squares fitting (Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm) for multiple datasets, including support for confidence intervals, bootstrap resampling, and model simulations. It facilitates both global and independent fits, with options for constraints, linking parameters, and detailed logging.",
  "sources": "Data input via data dictionaries ('x', 'y', 'ye'); data reading occurs in functions like lm_fit_global, simulate_from_params, and bootstrap worker functions. External model functions are passed as callables and invoked with parameter arrays and x-values. Configuration options are read from options dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data can flow through model function calls, parameter handling, and logging functions. Logging functions (_default_log_func, custom onLog) may receive messages, but only for benign purposes. No data leaks or external data transmissions are evident. No use of untrusted environment variables, insecure SQL, or code injection points are present. Model functions are assumed safe as they are user-supplied callables invoked with controlled parameters.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries to numpy arrays; model functions are called with parameters and x-values; residuals and cost are computed for optimization; bootstrap worker functions resample data and produce fitted curves; confidence interval calculations use residuals and Jacobians; logging functions record progress and errors. No external network communication or file I/O for malicious purposes is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The logging functions are default no-ops or user-defined, benign functions. Usage of numpy, scipy, and multiprocessing is standard for scientific computing. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. All external inputs are processed internally with validation, and no dangerous eval or exec statements are used.",
  "analysis": "The review systematically examined the code beginning with imports, default options, and helper classes (e.g., ParameterManager). The core functions perform typical scientific computations for model fitting, residuals, Jacobians, covariance, and confidence intervals. The bootstrap functions utilize multiprocessing with queues for parallel execution, but only for resampling and curve generation, with no external network activity. The functions accept user-defined logging functions; defaults are inert. No signals of malicious data leakage, external communication, or sabotage are found. The code aligns with standard scientific programming practices, and all external data manipulations are contained within the process scope. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, and the logic is transparent and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate scientific modeling, fitting, and bootstrap procedures without any evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It relies on user-supplied functions and data, but these are executed in controlled, non-exploitative ways. No external communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Overall, the code appears safe, trustworthy, and standard for scientific computing tasks.",
