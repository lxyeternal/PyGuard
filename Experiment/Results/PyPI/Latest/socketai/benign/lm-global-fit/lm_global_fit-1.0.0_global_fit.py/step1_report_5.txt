  "purpose": "The code implements a comprehensive Python package for multi-dataset nonlinear curve fitting using Levenberg-Marquardt optimization, including support for constraints, bootstrapping, confidence intervals, and simulation. It provides functions for global and independent fits, as well as model simulations with noise addition.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'data' dictionary and parameters from 'initial_parameters'. It also reads options from the 'options' dict, including control parameters for fitting, constraints, bootstrap, and logging functions.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could flow from external input in 'data' or 'options' dictionaries, or from parameters. The code does not write data to external systems, files, or network connections. Logging functions are called with message strings, but since default or user-defined functions are invoked, potential misuse depends on those functions' implementations.",
  "flows": "Data is passed from input dictionaries into internal functions for residual calculation, model evaluation, and optimization. User-defined 'onLog' and 'onProgress' functions are invoked with string messages and progress data, which could be exploited if malicious functions are supplied. The model functions are called with parameters and x-values, but they are user-defined and not sourced externally within this code; however, if user-defined, they could contain malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The code defines extensive custom functions with no evident obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network connections are present. The use of standard logging functions and external libraries (numpy, scipy, multiprocessing, etc.) appears benign. All input data is processed through numpy arrays and functions. The inclusion of detailed exception handling and logging indicates transparency, not concealment. No code injections, data leaks, or system disruptions are evident. The simulation function supports noise addition but does not perform unauthorized data exfiltration or system harm. No obfuscated or unusual language features are used; the code structure is clear and procedural.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis indicates that the code performs mathematical modeling, optimization, and statistical calculations with careful input validation and error handling. No parts of the code perform network access, file I/O (beyond benign plotting and standard logging), or system commands. User-supplied functions like 'onLog' and 'onProgress' are invoked but can be controlled by the user; however, this is typical for logging callbacks. The code avoids dangerous practices like executing arbitrary code, eval, exec, or writing to files. The use of multiprocessing for bootstrap fits is done safely with queues and context managers, with no evident malicious side-effects. All data flows are within the process scope, and no external command execution or network activity is performed. The code is complex but transparent, with no hidden or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a well-structured, mathematically focused Python package for data fitting, confidence interval estimation, and simulation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful system commands. It relies on user-defined functions for logging and model evaluation, which could be malicious if supplied by an attacker, but this is standard practice and not indicative of malicious intent within the package itself. Overall, the code is clean and secure based on the provided source.",
