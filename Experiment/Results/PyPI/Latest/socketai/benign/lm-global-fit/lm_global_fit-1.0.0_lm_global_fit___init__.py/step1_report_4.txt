{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to define the public interface of a Python module by importing specific functions from the 'lm_global_fit.global_fit' package and setting the __all__ attribute for export.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'lm_global_fit.global_fit' module.",
  "targets": "Functions imported: lm_fit_global, lm_fit, lm_fit_independent, simulate_from_params.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported functions into the module's namespace for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports four functions from a local or third-party package and explicitly exports them via __all__, which is a common pattern for defining public API of a module. The imports are straightforward and do not involve dynamic execution or suspicious code. There are no external data inputs, no sensitive information handling, and no code execution beyond importing functions. The code is minimal and appears to be a typical module setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard module setup code for Python packages, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports functions for external use without any suspicious logic or malicious code embedded.",
