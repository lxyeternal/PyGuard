  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions from a module named 'lm_global_fit.global_fit' and defines an export list for these functions.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions from 'lm_global_fit.global_fit'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only imports functions and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an export list definition. It does not process any user input, environment variables, or external data sources. There are no visible indications of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The module appears to be a simple re-export of functions from a submodule, typical for organizing code in a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, straightforward, and appears to serve as an interface for other parts of a project. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
