{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions from the 'lm_global_fit.global_fit' module and re-exports them via __all__, serving as a module interface or API layer.",
  "sources": "The code reads no untrusted input; it only imports functions from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code performs no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. It is a straightforward import/export pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports specific functions from a local package and defines __all__ for export. It performs no data handling, dynamic execution, or network activity. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's purpose is purely organizational, facilitating controlled exposure of functions. Given the simplicity and clarity, there are no security concerns or malicious intent. The absence of data processing, untrusted input handling, or external communication indicates a very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks. It is a standard module re-export pattern with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and justified.",
