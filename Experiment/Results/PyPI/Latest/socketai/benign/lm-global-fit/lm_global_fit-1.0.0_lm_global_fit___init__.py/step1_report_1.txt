  "purpose": "The code re-exports specific functions from the lm_global_fit.global_fit module, likely for use as an API or interface in a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from lm_global_fit.global_fit module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; no data is read from external sources or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs an import and exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be standard module export syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a local package module and re-exports them for external use. No code execution, data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The module structure appears standard, with no signs of malicious or maliciously altered code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing standard import and export operations without any malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior.",
