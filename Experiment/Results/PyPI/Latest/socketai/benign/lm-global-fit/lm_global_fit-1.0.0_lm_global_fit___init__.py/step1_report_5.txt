  "purpose": "This code exports specific functions from the 'lm_global_fit.global_fit' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from 'lm_global_fit.global_fit' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling evident.",
  "flows": "Imports and exports functions; no data flow or untrusted input processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import and export of functions, acting as an API interface or module interface. It does not process input, handle environment variables, or execute dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident from this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module that re-exports selected functions from another module, with no malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
