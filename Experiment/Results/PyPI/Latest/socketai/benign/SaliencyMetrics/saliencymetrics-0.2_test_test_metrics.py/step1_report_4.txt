{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test various image similarity and distance metrics used in a project to check their correctness and consistency.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from randomly generated numpy arrays (`test_map_1`, `test_map_2`) and input from imported functions such as `clip_mask` and `normalize_mask_0_1`.",
  "sinks": "The code performs in-memory computations and assertions. There are no sinks that lead to data leaks, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data (`test_map_1`, `test_map_2`) are processed through functions (`clip_mask`, `normalize_mask_0_1`) and then used as parameters in metric functions. The results are checked via assertions for symmetry, non-negativity, and expected zero-distance when maps are identical.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code uses standard numpy functions, assertions, and imported modules. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The only unusual aspect is the use of assertions for testing, which is typical in testing scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a set of metric functions from an external module `SaliencyMetrics`. It generates random test data, processes it with normalization and clipping functions, then performs multiple assertions to verify properties like symmetry, non-negativity, and zero distance for identical inputs. All operations are standard, memory-based, and intended for testing. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present, and there are no external data transmissions or system modifications. The code appears to be a straightforward testing script for image metrics.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard testing function for verifying metric implementations. It does not contain any malicious code or suspicious behavior. The use of assertions is typical for testing purposes, and there are no signs of malware or security risks.",
