  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and malicious potential of the open source dependency based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "No specific code snippets provided; analysis based on summaries and scores.",
  "sinks": "Not explicitly identified; potential concerns relate to dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden malicious patterns if present.",
  "flows": "Not directly observable; speculative without concrete code.",
  "anomalies": "Potential overestimation of malware and obfuscation in Report 3 without concrete evidence; scores suggest suspicion but lack code confirmation.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no malicious activity, with scores reflecting cautious assessments. Reports 1, 2, 4, and 5 are consistent with their summaries. Report 3 mentions potential dynamic execution and obfuscation but lacks concrete code snippets, leading to slightly inflated scores. Adjustments recommend lowering malware from 0.2 to 0.1 and obfuscated from 0.3 to 0.1, with risk scores around 0.2, to better align with the absence of evidence. Overall, the dependency appears benign with very low malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no confirmed malicious behavior; initial scores are slightly conservative but acceptable. Minor score reductions for Report 3 improve accuracy. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, and the dependency can be considered safe under current analysis.",
