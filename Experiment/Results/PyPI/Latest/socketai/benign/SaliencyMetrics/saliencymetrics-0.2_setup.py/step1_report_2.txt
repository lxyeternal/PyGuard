  "sinks": "No sinks indicate untrusted data handling or data leaks; no network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from reading the README.md file to setting package metadata and dependencies, with no external data flow or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns observed; code appears standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools for package configuration. It reads a README file for long description and specifies dependencies with fixed versions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, and all elements serve standard package setup purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs package configuration and dependency declaration.",
