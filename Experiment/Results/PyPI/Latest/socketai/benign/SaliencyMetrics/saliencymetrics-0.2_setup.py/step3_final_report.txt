  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; dependencies listed in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; dependencies are fixed versions, no dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package. It imports setuptools functions, reads a local README.md file for the long description, and specifies dependencies with fixed versions. There are no dynamic or untrusted inputs, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious code. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0. The code performs standard package setup tasks without any security risks or malicious behavior. The use of open() is common, and dependencies are explicitly declared, reducing supply chain concerns. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup.py script with no malicious or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
