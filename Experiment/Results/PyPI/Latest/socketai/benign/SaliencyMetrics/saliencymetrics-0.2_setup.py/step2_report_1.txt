  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- The code reads the long description from a local README.md file.\n- Dependencies are explicitly listed with fixed versions.\n- No untrusted input, data leaks, network activity, or code execution beyond package setup.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a typical setup.py, and all reports confirm that it functions as intended.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence or suspicion of malicious code, backdoors, or malware.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None identified; the code is straightforward.\n\n### Potential flaws or concerns:\n- The use of `open(\"README.md\").read()` could raise an exception if the file is missing, but this is a common pattern and not malicious.\n- Fixed dependency versions could pose maintenance issues but are not security concerns per se.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, justified because the code is a benign setup script.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No report claims or implies any vulnerability based on assumptions.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the provided code and reports, **the code is a legitimate, standard setup script with no security issues.** The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
