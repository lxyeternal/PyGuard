  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'SaliencyMetrics', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports setuptools for package setup; reads 'README.md' for long description; specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "flows": "Read from 'README.md' (trusted file) during setup, dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It imports necessary modules, defines package metadata, and specifies dependencies. It reads a local file 'README.md' for long description, which is a common practice. No code executes untrusted input, and no suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign and typical package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
