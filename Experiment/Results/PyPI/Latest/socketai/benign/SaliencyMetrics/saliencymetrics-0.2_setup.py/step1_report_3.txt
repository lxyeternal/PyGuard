{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'SaliencyMetrics', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the long description from 'README.md' using open() and specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there is no untrusted data output or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading the README file for long description during setup, and installing specified dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "The use of open() to read 'README.md' is normal for setup scripts; no suspicious or unusual code behavior is detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions for packaging. It reads a local markdown file for long description, and specifies dependencies with fixed versions. There are no dynamic code executions, no data leaks, and no malicious code or backdoors present. The code appears to be a typical setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
