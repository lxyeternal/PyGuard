{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging the SaliencyMetrics Python project, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "None significant for data input; standard setup.py metadata and dependencies declarations.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data processing or output; setup configuration does not involve external input handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; setup script primarily declares package metadata and dependencies without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected; standard setuptools usage.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to configure package installation. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious external communications. Dependencies are explicitly listed with specific versions, and no code injection or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It only specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
