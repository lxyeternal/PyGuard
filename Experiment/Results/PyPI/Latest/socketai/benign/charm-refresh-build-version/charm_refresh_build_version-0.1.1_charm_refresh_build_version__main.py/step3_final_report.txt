  "purpose": "Extract version information from git tags using dunamai, process the tag, and update a local TOML file with the charm version.",
  "sources": "dunamai.Version.from_git() for git tags, result._matched_tag (private attribute), pathlib.Path for file reading, tomlkit.load() and dump() for file operations.",
  "sinks": "Updating 'charm' key in the local 'refresh_versions.toml' file.",
  "flows": "Git tag retrieved via dunamai -> processed to extract version components -> charm_version string constructed -> file opened for reading -> versions loaded -> updated -> written back.",
  "anomalies": "Use of private attribute 'result._matched_tag' from dunamai, which could be fragile if internal API changes, but does not pose security risks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard version extraction from git tags, processes the tag string, and updates a local configuration file. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The reliance on a private attribute is a minor maintainability concern but not a security issue. No network activity, code injection, or handling of untrusted input beyond controlled git tags. The code is straightforward and uses common libraries. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward version management utility with negligible security risk. The only minor concern is reliance on an internal attribute, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with malware score 0 and obfuscation score 0. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified but does not indicate actual vulnerability. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
