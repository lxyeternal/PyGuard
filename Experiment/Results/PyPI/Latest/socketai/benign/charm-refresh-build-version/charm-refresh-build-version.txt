      "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward version management utility with negligible security risk. The only minor concern is reliance on an internal attribute, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with malware score 0 and obfuscation score 0. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified but does not indicate actual vulnerability. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use."
