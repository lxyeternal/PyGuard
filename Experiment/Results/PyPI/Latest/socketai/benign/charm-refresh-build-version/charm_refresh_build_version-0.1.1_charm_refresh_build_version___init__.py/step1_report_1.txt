  "sources": "Potential sources include user input functions, environment variable reads, or external data fetches, but none are explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve system calls, network communications, or data writes, but specific sink points cannot be identified without the code.",
  "flows": "Flow paths from sources to sinks cannot be established without actual code segments demonstrating data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observable due to the absence of code.",
  "analysis": "The review process cannot be completed effectively as the code snippet is missing. Without the actual code, it is impossible to identify sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, or malicious behavior.",
