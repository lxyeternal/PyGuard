{
  "purpose": "Display a cross-platform popup notification during module load and define package setup metadata.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP), system info (platform.system()), input parameters (popup_title, popup_text).",
  "sinks": "System commands (osascript, zenity, kdialog), Windows API (MessageBoxW), print statements.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and system info influence which display method is invoked; input parameters are used directly in commands.",
  "anomalies": "Popup is triggered immediately upon module import, which is unconventional for setup scripts but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard APIs and commands to display UI notifications across platforms. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or network activity are present. The immediate popup during import is unusual but benign, serving as a user notification. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected. The environment variable influences display logic but is used safely. The overall structure is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning solely as a cross-platform notification mechanism during package setup. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The only minor concern is the immediate popup on import, which could be considered intrusive but not malicious. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
