  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code appears to be a set of unit tests for the `requests.help` module, specifically testing the `info()` function and its handling of `system_ssl` and `idna`.\n   - The tests themselves seem straightforward and do not reveal any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - The reports, however, are all \"Empty response\" with no raw response data provided.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports do not contain any descriptive information about the nature of the incident, only that the response was empty.\n   - Without additional context or payloads, it's impossible to determine if there's an actual security issue or if the incident is a false alarm.\n   - The reports lack details about what was expected versus what was received, making it difficult to verify if the code was compromised or if the responses indicate malicious activity.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - Since all reports are \"Empty response\" with no further info, any scores assigned to potential malware, obfuscation, or risk should be carefully justified.\n   - If the reports are simply missing data, assigning high scores (e.g., >0.5) would be unreasonable without further evidence.\n   - Conversely, if the empty responses are symptomatic of an attack or malicious interference, higher scores could be justified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - No evidence from the reports suggests malicious activity or vulnerabilities; the absence of data alone does not indicate a threat.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain low unless additional context indicates otherwise.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code itself is not malicious; it is testing code.\n   - The reports do not provide evidence of malware or malicious behavior.\n   - Without payloads or suspicious responses, the malware score should be minimal or zero.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume \"Empty response\" is suspicious, but this could be due to network issues, misconfiguration, or benign errors.\n   - No assumptions about malicious activity can be confidently made based solely on empty responses.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - Given the lack of detailed data, any high scores would be unjustified.\n   - The scores should reflect the absence of evidence rather than speculation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code Review:** The code appears legitimate, testing the `info()` function's handling of SSL and `idna` version info.\n- **Incident Reports:** Lack of data prevents any definitive conclusions.\n- **Scores:** Should be low for malware, obfuscated, and risk unless further evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n### Recommended scores:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, possibly just a network or response issue, but not necessarily risky)\n\n**Summary:** The incident reports do not provide sufficient evidence to assign higher risk or malware scores. The code itself is standard testing code, and the empty responses are likely benign or due to external factors. Further data would be needed to reassess.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always seek additional context or payloads before escalating scores based solely on empty responses.",
