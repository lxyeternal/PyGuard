{
  "purpose": "Unit tests verifying the behavior of requests.help.info() regarding system SSL info and package version attributes.",
  "sources": "The info() function's internal data retrieval, mock patches of 'requests.help.idna' and 'requests.help' attributes.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data flows; tests only access internal attributes and mock objects.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code does not process untrusted input or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward test code with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing of the info() function, mocking package attributes to verify version extraction. The reports indicate 'Empty response' errors, but without the implementation of info(), these are likely environment or setup issues rather than security concerns. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code itself is benign and correctly structured for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is safe, standard test code, with no evidence of malicious activity or security issues. The reports of empty responses are likely environmental or configuration problems, not indicative of malicious behavior. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be minimal or zero, reflecting the absence of any security threat.",
