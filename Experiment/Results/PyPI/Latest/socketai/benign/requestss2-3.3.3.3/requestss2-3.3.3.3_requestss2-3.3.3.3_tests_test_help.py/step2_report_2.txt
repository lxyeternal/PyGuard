  "review": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code:**\n   - All reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response data. Since the code provided is a test suite for `requests.help.info()`, and the reports do not contain any specific findings or anomalies, there's no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities directly in the code.\n   - The code itself appears to be straightforward test cases verifying the behavior of `info()` with respect to system SSL info and the IDNA package version attribute.\n\n2. **Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary:**\n   - The reports are empty, providing no details or context. Without specific error messages or anomalies, they do not contribute meaningful information.\n   - The \"Empty response\" message suggests that perhaps the reports are incomplete or that the testing environment did not produce any output, but this alone does not indicate a security issue.\n\n3. **Review the scores given to each issue:**\n   - Since no issues are detailed, assigning any risk, malware, or obfuscated scores would be unwarranted.\n   - The absence of evidence does not justify high scores; a score of 0 or very low scores are appropriate here.\n\n4. **Justify any risk score higher than 0.5:**\n   - No issues or suspicious activity are identified. Therefore, any risk score above 0.5 is unjustified.\n   - The code appears to be standard test code for verifying package attributes.\n\n5. **Pay attention to malware score:**\n   - No malware activity is suggested by the code or reports.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does the report mention any suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Challenge any claims based on assumptions:**\n   - Since the reports contain no specific claims or findings, there's nothing to challenge.\n   - The empty responses could be due to environment issues, not malicious activity.\n\n7. **Check consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - Given the lack of details, consistent scoring would be to assign minimal or zero risk, malware, and obfuscated scores.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Code review:** The code is benign, straightforward test code.\n- **Report validity:** The reports are empty, providing no evidence of issues.\n- **Scores:** Should be minimal or zero across all categories.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Score | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score   | 0.0               | No malicious activity or code present.                       |\n| Obfuscated Score| 0.0             | Code is clear and straightforward.                            |\n| Risk Score      | 0.1               | No evident vulnerabilities; environment issues might exist. |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant risk in the provided code or reports. The reports are empty, likely indicating no issues detected or a reporting problem. The code itself is safe and standard for testing package attributes.",
