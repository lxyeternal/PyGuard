  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n**1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- The reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response data. Since the code under review does not involve any network calls or external responses, these reports seem unrelated or invalid in this context.\n- The code is primarily unit tests verifying the behavior of the `info()` function and handling of the `idna` package attribute. There are no network interactions or external responses involved.\n- **Conclusion:** The reports do not correspond to any issues in the provided code. They seem to be generic or misplaced reports.\n\n---\n\n**2. Identify and record any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary**\n\n- The reports lack detail; they only mention \"Empty response\" without specifying what was expected or what the context was.\n- Given the code, no external responses are involved, so these reports are not applicable or are based on incorrect assumptions.\n- **Flaw:** The reports are not relevant to the code's logic or behavior.\n\n---\n\n**3. Review the scores given to each issue and suggest any changes**\n\n- Since the reports are irrelevant, any scores assigned to them are unjustified.\n- **Recommendation:** Do not assign any risk or malware scores based on these reports; they should be considered invalid or ignored.\n\n---\n\n**4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5**\n\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity, network communication, or potentially dangerous operations.\n- The only potential concern could be the handling of package attributes, but nothing malicious is evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Risk scores should be minimal or zero.\n\n---\n\n**5. Pay close attention to the malware score**\n\n- No malware behavior is present; the code does not execute external code, download, or execute payloads.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score should be 0.\n\n---\n\n**6. Challenge any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports are empty and do not specify any vulnerability, so any claims of vulnerabilities are unfounded.\n- The code appears to be straightforward unit tests with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n**7. Make sure the scores are consistent with the report**\n\n- Since the reports are invalid or unrelated, the scores should reflect that there is no real issue.\n- The current scoring (not explicitly provided, but implied to be high) should be lowered to zero or \"no issue.\"\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or code hiding)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no real security risk identified)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The code's logic is sound for its purpose: testing the presence and version of `system_ssl` and `idna`.\n- The reports do not reflect actual issues; they seem to be placeholder or misaligned reports.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are invalid, and no security concerns are present in the code. The scores should be adjusted accordingly to reflect no issues.",
