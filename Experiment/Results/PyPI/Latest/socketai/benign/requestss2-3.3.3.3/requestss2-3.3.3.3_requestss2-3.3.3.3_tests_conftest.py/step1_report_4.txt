{
  "purpose": "The code sets up an HTTP server, including a secure version with SSL, and provides fixtures for testing HTTP requests, including HTTPS with certificates.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from the URL input in prepare_url, and creates SSL contexts and certificates in nosan_server fixture.",
  "sinks": "URL manipulation in prepare_url, SSL context configuration, server socket wrapping, and thread handling.",
  "flows": "prepare_url takes a URL input, appends a slash, and joins suffixes to create full URLs; nosan_server creates certificates, configures SSL context, and runs a server in a separate thread.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard test setup for HTTP and HTTPS servers. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. Usage of trustme CA for certificate generation is typical for testing. No obfuscated or unusual code features. No suspicious data flows or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports server modules with compatibility for different Python versions, sets up fixtures for HTTP and HTTPS servers, and generates certificates dynamically for testing secure connections. No suspicious code behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent are observed. The use of trustme for certificate management and threading for server operation is standard for test environments. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious code injection are present. The code appears to be a typical setup for testing HTTP clients, with no security risks or malicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test setup for HTTP/HTTPS servers with proper SSL certificate handling. No malicious or maliciously suspicious behavior is detected. It poses no security threat and is used for testing purposes only.",
