{
  "purpose": "Set up local HTTP/HTTPS servers for testing, with dynamic SSL certificate generation and URL handling fixtures.",
  "sources": "URL parameter 'value', environment data for SSL cert creation, server socket and threading setup",
  "sinks": "Server socket creation, SSL wrapping, URL joining, server start/stop functions",
  "flows": "URL construction from 'value', SSL context configuration, server socket wrapping, server serving in thread",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors; use of trustme CA for certs is standard in testing",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test setup for local HTTP/HTTPS servers, employing standard libraries and practices. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. SSL certificates are generated dynamically for localhost, typical for testing environments. No external data leaks or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk ~0.1) are consistent with the code's purpose and safety profile.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test setup for local servers with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are justified and align with the code's benign nature.",
