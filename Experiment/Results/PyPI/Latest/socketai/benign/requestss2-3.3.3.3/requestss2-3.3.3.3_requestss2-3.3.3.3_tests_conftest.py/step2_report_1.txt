  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code sets up an HTTP server with optional SSL, primarily for testing, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is standard for testing environments.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.\n- SSL certificates are generated via trustme CA, which is typical for testing.\n- The low security risk score (0.1) seems reasonable, considering it's test code.\n- The malware score is appropriately zero.\n- The obfuscated score is zero, as code is straightforward.\n- The confidence is high (0.9), consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues found. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard test setup with self-signed certificates, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- All observations are consistent with standard testing practices.\n- No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- The security risk is zero, which aligns with the code's purpose.\n- Confidence is perfect (1), matching the thorough analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment. No issues or suspicious activity. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard test setup for HTTP/HTTPS servers with SSL, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Use of trustme CA for certificates is standard.\n- No suspicious code or data leaks.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, consistent, and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard test server setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.2), but still within a reasonable range for test code involving SSL.\n- No malware or obfuscation.\n- The code is straightforward, and no malicious intent is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard test setup, no malicious behavior, fixtures for pytest, SSL certificates generated for testing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No suspicious code, no malware, no obfuscation.\n- The code is typical for test environments.\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No. All reports correctly identify that the code is standard test setup code for HTTP/HTTPS servers.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports, but still very low, reflecting the test environment context.\n- **Confidence Levels:** High, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** ~0.1 (consistent with test code involving SSL certificates and server setup, which pose minimal security risk)\n\nThis code is a standard, safe test setup for local HTTP/HTTPS servers, with no malicious or obfuscated components. The scores across reports are justified and consistent with the code's purpose.",
