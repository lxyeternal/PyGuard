  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code handles optional import with a fallback for different urllib3 versions.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import SNIMissingWarning from urllib3.exceptions, setting warnings to always trigger this warning during tests. If the import fails (likely because of urllib3 2.0+), SNIMissingWarning is set to None, and no warning filter is applied. This setup ensures consistent warning behavior across different library versions, solely related to SSL/TLS warnings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup for handling warnings during testing, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
