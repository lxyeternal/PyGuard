  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only modifies warning behavior.",
  "flows": "Import of SNIMissingWarning -> warnings.simplefilter call to always trigger the warning.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code modifies warning filters to ensure warnings are always triggered during tests.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports SNIMissingWarning from urllib3.exceptions and sets it to always trigger warnings if available. If the import fails, it sets SNIMissingWarning to None. The purpose appears to be to ensure warnings related to missing SNI are always emitted during testing, which is a legitimate testing setup and not malicious. No suspicious behavior, code injection, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test setup to enforce warning emission for SNIMissingWarning in urllib3. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
