  "anomalies": "Conditional handling of ImportError to set SNIMissingWarning to None if import fails",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import SNIMissingWarning from urllib3.exceptions. If successful, it sets the warning filter to 'always' for that warning to ensure it triggers during tests. If the import fails (e.g., in urllib3 2.0+), it assigns None to SNIMissingWarning, skipping the filter setup. This logic is straightforward, version-aware, and intended solely for test warning visibility. No untrusted data, malicious code, or obfuscation is present. The code is a benign setup snippet for testing SSL warning emissions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test setup for warning configuration, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as such, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of zero. The overall assessment is that the code is safe, straightforward, and well-understood.",
