  "purpose": "Unit tests verifying behavior of CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict classes from requests.structures.",
  "sources": "In-memory data structures, fixture setup, parameterized test inputs",
  "sinks": "No external data, network, or file operations; internal class method calls",
  "flows": "Test inputs flow through class methods and assertions within the test functions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of standard unit tests for well-known classes, with no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It verifies class behaviors such as case-insensitive key handling, copying, equality, and attribute access. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The tests operate entirely on in-memory data, and all signals point to benign, straightforward testing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
