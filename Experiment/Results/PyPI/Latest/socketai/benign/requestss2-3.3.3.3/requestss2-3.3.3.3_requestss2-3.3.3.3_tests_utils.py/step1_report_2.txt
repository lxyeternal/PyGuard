  "purpose": "A context manager to temporarily override environment variables in Python.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters (kwargs) and current environment variables (os.environ).",
  "sinks": "Modification of os.environ, which affects environment variables for the current process.",
  "flows": "Read from existing environment variables -> Override with new values from kwargs -> Restore original environment variables after context.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed. The code correctly manages environment variables temporarily.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager that saves current environment variables, applies temporary overrides based on provided keyword arguments, and restores the original environment after the context exits. It handles removal of variables when value is None. The code is straightforward, uses standard library functions, and performs environment variable management without any obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a safe utility for temporarily setting environment variables within a context. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious actions are present.",
