  "purpose": "This code provides a context manager to temporarily override environment variables in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables via os.environ to save and modify them.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies os.environ, which affects the environment variables for the process.",
  "flows": "The code saves the current environment, updates or deletes variables, executes a block, then restores the environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are present. The code performs standard environment variable management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager 'override_environ' that saves current environment variables, applies modifications as specified by keyword arguments (adding, updating, or deleting variables), yields control to the block, and then restores the original environment. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code appears to be a utility for controlled environment variable overrides, commonly used in testing or scripting. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for temporarily overriding environment variables and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
