  "purpose": "This code provides a context manager to temporarily override environment variables in Python.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables via os.environ and the provided kwargs for override values.",
  "sinks": "Modifies os.environ, which could affect environment variables during context execution.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are overwritten in the context and restored afterward; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code simply manages environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager that temporarily overrides environment variables by saving the current state, applying changes, and restoring the original environment after execution. It uses standard library functions, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code operates solely on environment variables without external inputs or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing environment variables during a context. It poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
