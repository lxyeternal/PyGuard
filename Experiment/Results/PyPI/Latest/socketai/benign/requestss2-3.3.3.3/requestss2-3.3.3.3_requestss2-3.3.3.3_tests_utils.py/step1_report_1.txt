  "purpose": "Provides a context manager to temporarily override environment variables within a code block.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables from os.environ when saving the current environment state; reads kwargs to set or delete environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Modifies os.environ to change environment variables temporarily.",
  "flows": "Input: kwargs to override_env; Source: os.environ; Sink: os.environ modifications; Flow: Save current env -> override with new values -> yield control -> restore environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; straightforward environment variable management.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a context manager that temporarily overrides environment variables by saving the current environment, applying specified changes, and restoring the original environment after the block executes. No external inputs, untrusted data handling, or malicious behaviors are present. The implementation is standard and safe. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a safe utility for temporarily changing environment variables. There is no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risk in the implementation.",
