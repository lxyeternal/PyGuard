  "purpose": "A context manager to temporarily override environment variables within a code block.",
  "sources": "Reads current environment variables with os.environ, and the provided keyword arguments to set or delete environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the process environment variables via os.environ during the context, which could affect other parts of the program but not external systems directly.",
  "flows": "Reads from os.environ to save state, updates os.environ with new values or deletions, then restores original environment after context exits.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or malicious code; the code simply manages environment variables in a standard way.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager to override environment variables temporarily. It saves the current environment, applies changes based on input kwargs, and restores the original environment afterwards. The implementation is straightforward and uses standard library functions without obfuscation or suspicious behavior. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious actions are present. The code could influence application behavior during its context, but this is expected for such a utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard environment variable override mechanism with proper save and restore logic. It poses no security threats, malware, or malicious intent based on its content and usage.",
