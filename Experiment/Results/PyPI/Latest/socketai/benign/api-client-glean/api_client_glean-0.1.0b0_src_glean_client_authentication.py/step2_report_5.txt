  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard SDK client for an API endpoint to create authentication tokens.\n- It handles parameters, environment variables, network requests, and errors in a typical manner.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are evident.\n- The code uses `get_security_from_env()` to fetch security info from environment variables, which is standard practice.\n- The network functions (`do_request`, `do_request_async`) are typical request handlers, with no suspicious behavior observed.\n- Error handling is comprehensive, raising exceptions with response details.\n- No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate; SDK for token creation, no anomalies.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — moderate, typical for SDKs handling tokens.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis states the code is straightforward, with no malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct; similar to Report 1.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — standard for such SDKs.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate; standard SDK pattern.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — slightly lower, reflecting standard practice.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, code appears safe.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct; standard request handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — typical for SDKs managing tokens.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores align with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct; consistent with other reports.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — typical.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scoring consistency:**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting typical SDK operation.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9), which is appropriate given the code's clarity and standard patterns.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, standard SDK.\n\n**Estimated security risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — reflects typical SDK risk, no significant concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK client with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — 0.2 (standard for such SDKs)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo further action needed. The supply chain security posture of this code is sound based on the provided snippets and analysis.",
