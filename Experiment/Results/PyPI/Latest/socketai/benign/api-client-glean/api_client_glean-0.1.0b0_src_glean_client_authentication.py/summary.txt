  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK component for API interaction, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) reflects typical SDK operational risks, primarily due to environment variable reliance, which is standard. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious activity. Overall, the code appears safe and free from supply chain threats."
