{
  "purpose": "The code implements a client SDK class for creating authentication tokens via an API, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations, with request building, response handling, and error management.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to methods, environment variables accessed via get_security_from_env(), response streams from network requests.",
  "sinks": "Network requests and response parsing; no data leaks or unsafe code identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and environment variables influence request construction; responses are parsed and errors raised accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK client for API token creation, with proper handling of inputs, environment variables, retries, and responses. No malicious or sabotage indicators are present. The use of environment variables for security info is standard practice. Error handling is comprehensive, and network interactions follow typical patterns. No obfuscation or malicious network activity is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK component for API interaction, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) reflects typical SDK operational risks, primarily due to environment variable reliance, which is standard. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious activity. Overall, the code appears safe and free from supply chain threats.",
