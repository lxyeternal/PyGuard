{
  "purpose": "The code provides a client SDK for creating authentication tokens via an API, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from environment variables and self.sdk_configuration, accepts input parameters for token creation, and fetches response data from HTTP responses.",
  "sinks": "Returns JSON unmarshaled objects, raises exceptions with error messages, and processes HTTP response data for errors or success.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to build API request objects, which are sent over HTTP. Responses are checked and processed for success or error conditions, with untrusted HTTP response data potentially being included in errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code appears standard for API client SDKs. The get_security_from_env function is used to fetch security info from environment, but its implementation is not shown here. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically constructs API requests and handles responses with standard error handling. It uses environment variables for security configuration, which is typical. No unusual data flows or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an API client for token creation, with appropriate error handling and async support.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code is a typical SDK component designed to interact with an API, with no signs of malware, data leakage, or supply chain attacks. It appears safe based on the provided code.",
