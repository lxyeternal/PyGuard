  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard SDK for rotating API tokens, with synchronous and asynchronous methods.\n- They highlight the use of environment variables for security, proper request building, retries, and error handling.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The code's purpose and flow are consistent with typical API client SDKs.\n- The malware scores are all 0, and confidence levels are high (0.9), indicating that the reviewers see no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Potential Issues:\n\n**Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n- The code appears correct and functional for its purpose.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- The reports do not identify any logical errors or security flaws.\n- The error handling is appropriate.\n- The use of environment variables for security is standard and not suspicious.\n\n**Scores and their justification:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is justified given the code's benign nature.\n- `securityRisk` scores are low (~0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk.\n- The high confidence scores (0.9) are justified by the thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and the lack of malicious indicators, the risk scores are appropriately low. They could potentially be even lower (e.g., 0.1) but are reasonable as is.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code performs legitimate SDK functions.\n- It handles security and network operations securely.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n**Malware:** 0 — No malicious intent or payload detected.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — Minimal inherent risk; standard SDK code with environment-based security.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe provided code is a standard, well-structured SDK component for rotating API tokens, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe and trustworthy based on the provided analysis.",
