  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SDK for token rotation, using environment variables and parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Sends HTTP POST to `/api/index/v1/rotatetoken`, processes responses, raises errors.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Uses environment variables for security, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate SDK, no malicious signs, high confidence (0.9). Malware score: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing straightforward request handling, environment-based security, and standard error processing.\n- No suspicious activity or code anomalies.\n- High confidence (0.9), malware score: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also describes a typical SDK pattern for token rotation, with standard request building, response handling, and environment variable usage.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, risk: 0.1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar observations: standard SDK pattern, environment variables, no obfuscation or malicious code.\n- No signs of malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, risk: 0.1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Reiterates the same pattern: straightforward API request, environment-based security, proper error handling.\n- No suspicious activity or code anomalies.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious intent, consistent with a score of 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, as the code performs legitimate SDK functions with standard security practices.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Very low, primarily due to reliance on environment variables and standard network operations, which are common in SDKs.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured SDK implementation for rotating API tokens. It uses environment variables for security, handles network requests and errors appropriately, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nNo immediate security concerns based on the provided code and reports. Continue monitoring for any future updates or anomalies, but current evidence suggests the code is benign and functions as intended.",
