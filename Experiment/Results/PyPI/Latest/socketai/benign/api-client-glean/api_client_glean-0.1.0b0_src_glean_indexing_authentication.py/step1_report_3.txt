{
  "purpose": "The code provides SDK functions to rotate API tokens for the Indexing API, including synchronous and asynchronous methods.",
  "sources": "Reads environment security settings via get_security_from_env; accepts user-provided server_url and http_headers; uses internal methods to build requests and process responses.",
  "sinks": "Uses do_request and do_request_async to send HTTP POST requests; raises errors with response data; streams response bodies to text for error handling.",
  "flows": "User inputs (server_url, http_headers) are incorporated into request setup; security information from environment is used in hook context; HTTP responses are processed, and error data is surfaced.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code employs standard request building, response handling, and error raising procedures. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK implementation for token rotation involving HTTP requests. It manages retries, handles various HTTP status codes, and raises errors accordingly. It relies on environment variables for security configurations, which is common practice. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications, are evident. The logic appears straightforward and aligned with typical API interaction patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, seemingly benign SDK module for token management with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage. It follows normal patterns for HTTP request/response handling, with no suspicious activity detected.",
