  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard SDK for token rotation.\n- Source & Sink: Uses environment variables, request building, response processing.\n- Anomalies: None suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Legitimate request/response handling, proper error management.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior or sabotage.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar SDK for token rotation.\n- Source & Sink: Standard request handling; potential concern about error info leakage.\n- Anomalies: None suspicious; standard patterns.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious activity; typical SDK behavior.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent, safe for supply chain.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same SDK functions.\n- Source & Sink: Uses environment security info, standard request/response.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Straightforward API interaction, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign SDK component.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Token rotation SDK.\n- Source & Sink: Standard environment security sourcing, request handling.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Typical SDK implementation, no malicious indicators.\n- Conclusion: No signs of sabotage.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: SDK for token rotation.\n- Source & Sink: Uses environment variables, standard request flow.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Typical, secure SDK pattern.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** All reports agree there are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected in the code.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, primarily related to potential exposure of sensitive info via error messages, which is typical and manageable.\n- **Scores Justification:** The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis. The risk scores are also appropriately low, reflecting standard SDK behavior without evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, typical security considerations for SDKs handling sensitive data, but no actual vulnerabilities)\n\n**In conclusion,** the code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK component for token rotation, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No signs of supply chain sabotage.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- Overall malware, obfuscation, and risk scores should remain at **0, 0, and ~0.1–0.2** respectively.",
