  "purpose": "This code defines a SDK class for rotating API tokens for the Indexing API, providing synchronous and asynchronous methods to request token rotation from a server.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (via get_security_from_env), method parameters (retries, server_url, timeout_ms, http_headers), and internal SDK configuration.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to '/api/index/v1/rotatetoken' endpoint, processing of HTTP response, raising errors, and unmarshalling JSON response.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (including environment security variables) -> build request -> send request to server -> receive response -> process response -> possibly raise error or return data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No evident obfuscation. Use of environment variables for security is standard. No dynamic code execution or data exfiltration mechanisms observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely constructs HTTP requests to rotate API tokens, handling retries and errors. No malicious payloads or suspicious network activities are embedded. The code handles responses and errors appropriately, raising exceptions for known error status codes. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code leverages environment variables for security configuration, which is standard practice. Overall, the code appears to perform legitimate SDK operations without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK implementation for token rotation, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles requests and responses securely, with proper error handling. There are no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
