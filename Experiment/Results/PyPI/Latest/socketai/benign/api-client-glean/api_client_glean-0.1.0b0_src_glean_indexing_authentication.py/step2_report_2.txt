  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard SDK implementation for token rotation, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- The code relies on environment variables for security configuration, which is common practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or dynamic code execution are detected.\n- The primary concern raised is about potential exposure of sensitive data via error messages, which is typical and not malicious.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code appears to function as intended, constructing and sending HTTP requests for token rotation.\n- No issues with the core logic, security, or data handling are evident.\n- The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious payloads.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The only minor concern is that error responses are streamed and included in exceptions, which could leak sensitive information if logs are not managed properly. However, this is standard in SDKs and not inherently malicious.\n- No actual bugs or vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard network and security practices, with minor concern about error message exposure.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on code behavior.\n- No signs of supply chain sabotage or malicious intent are present.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the potential for error message leakage, a slight increase to 0.2-0.3 could be justified, but the current scores are acceptable.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**\n\n| Category        | Score |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Malware         | 0      |\n| Obfuscated      | 0      |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2    |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured SDK component for token rotation, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the code's behavior.",
