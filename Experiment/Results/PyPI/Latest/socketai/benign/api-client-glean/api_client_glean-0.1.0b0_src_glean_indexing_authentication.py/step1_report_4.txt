{
  "purpose": "The code provides an SDK class for rotating an API token, including synchronous and asynchronous methods, with configuration options for retries, server URL, timeout, and headers.",
  "sources": "Reads environment security settings via get_security_from_env; reads request/response data from HTTP requests and responses; reads configuration parameters such as retries, server_url, timeout_ms, and http_headers.",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposes sensitive data through errors and response handling; uses environment variables for security info; handles HTTP responses that could contain untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., retries, server_url, headers) influence request construction; request is sent via do_request or do_request_async; response is processed and either returned or errors are raised based on response status and content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are observed; use of environment-based security sourcing; no obfuscation, unusual language features, or misleading variable names; no signs of malicious code such as network exfiltration, system damage, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK implementation for token rotation, with proper request construction, response handling, and error raising. It utilizes environment variables for security information, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform any unsafe operations, data exfiltration, or hidden malicious actions. The logic and structure align with standard API client patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SDK implementation for token rotation with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. It manages security and network requests appropriately, without including malicious or suspicious code segments.",
