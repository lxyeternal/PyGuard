  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's logic, security implications, and the provided scores.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a class with methods to rotate API tokens via HTTP POST requests.\n- Both synchronous and asynchronous methods are provided.\n- It constructs requests using internal methods, handles retries, and processes responses.\n- Environment variables are used for security configuration via `get_security_from_env`.\n- Error handling raises exceptions for various HTTP error codes.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard SDK for token rotation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, proper request handling, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The low security risk and malware score are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** SDK for token rotation, standard request/response flow.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; potential concern about error response exposure, but typical in SDKs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The slightly higher security risk reflects typical concerns about error info exposure, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** SDK for token rotation, standard patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, normal request handling, environment-based security.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** SDK for token rotation, standard request/response.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; uses environment variables properly.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** SDK for token rotation, standard patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard error handling and environment security sourcing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The security risk score is slightly higher but justified due to potential info exposure in errors.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variations (0.1 or 0.2) are justified based on potential information leakage via error responses, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activities are present.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9) across reports, consistent with the thorough analysis.\n\n### **Final Personal Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and standard.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — Slightly elevated due to error handling, but overall low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, standard SDK implementation for token rotation, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's logic and security posture.",
