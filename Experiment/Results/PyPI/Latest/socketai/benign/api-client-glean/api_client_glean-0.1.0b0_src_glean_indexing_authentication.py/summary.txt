  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK component for token rotation, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to error message exposure, which is typical in SDKs. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting standard security considerations without vulnerabilities."
