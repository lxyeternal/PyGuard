{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class for rotating API tokens within an indexing service, including both synchronous and asynchronous methods.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via get_security_from_env, input parameters (retries, server_url, timeout_ms, http_headers), internal method calls such as _build_request and do_request.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could flow from HTTP responses to exceptions; potential leak if error details are exposed or logged. No direct use of untrusted input data in critical security-sensitive operations such as command execution or data storage.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., retries, server_url, http_headers) influence request construction; HTTP responses are evaluated for success or error; response content may be unmarshaled or used in errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are detected. Usage of standard libraries and typical API request/response handling patterns. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward SDK wrapper for token rotation API endpoints, with proper request building, retries, and error handling. It retrieves environment-based security info via get_security_from_env. The HTTP response processing and error raising follow common patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors. The only potential concern is handling of error responses which could reveal sensitive information if logs are not managed properly, but this is typical in SDKs and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API SDK implementation for token rotation with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code. It functions as intended for secure API communication without introducing security risks.",
