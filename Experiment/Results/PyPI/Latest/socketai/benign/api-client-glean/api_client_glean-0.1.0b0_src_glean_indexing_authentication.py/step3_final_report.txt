{
  "purpose": "The code implements a client SDK for rotating API tokens via HTTP POST requests, providing both synchronous and asynchronous methods, with environment-based security configuration and standard error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from environment variables, constructs HTTP requests, and processes responses.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs error details and response data; no direct data leaks or malicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables or parameters -> Request construction -> HTTP request -> Response handling -> Error or success response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard SDK patterns for API interaction, with proper request building, retries, and error handling. It uses environment variables for security, handles different response codes appropriately, and provides both sync and async methods. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The error responses are streamed and included in exceptions, which is typical but could leak info if logs are not managed, yet this is not malicious. Overall, the code appears legitimate and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK component for token rotation, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to error message exposure, which is typical in SDKs. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting standard security considerations without vulnerabilities.",
