{
  "purpose": "Define protocols and utility functions for managing HTTP and asynchronous HTTP clients, primarily for resource management and clean-up in an SDK context.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, protocol methods, and the function 'close_clients'. No external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "The 'close_clients' function calls 'close' and 'aclose' methods on client objects, which could potentially lead to resource management issues but are standard cleanup methods.",
  "flows": "Not applicable as there are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only manages client objects and their cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code uses standard async and sync cleanup patterns, and the comments clarify its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines protocols for HTTP clients with methods for sending requests and building requests, both sync and async. The 'close_clients' function handles proper cleanup of these clients, including asynchronous cleanup within an executor if called within an async loop, which is a common pattern for resource management. No external inputs, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation techniques are present. The code is focused on resource cleanup without performing network operations or data processing that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for managing HTTP client lifecycle in an SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows typical patterns for resource cleanup and does not include suspicious or malicious elements.",
