  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines protocols and utility functions for managing HTTP clients.\n- Data flow: From parameters to request construction and cleanup.\n- Anomalies: None detected; standard resource management.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, standard SDK resource management code.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2 (low).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Protocols for HTTP clients and cleanup utility.\n- Data flow: No external input; manages client objects.\n- Anomalies: Unconventional pattern of closing async clients within threads, but not malicious.\n- Analysis: Standard cleanup with some unusual patterns but benign.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent, typical resource management.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Protocols and cleanup functions.\n- Data flow: Manages client objects, no external untrusted data involved.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code; standard cleanup pattern.\n- Analysis: Focused on resource cleanup, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Protocols and utility functions for HTTP clients.\n- Data flow: No external data processing; cleanup functions.\n- Anomalies: No malicious code; use of asyncio.run inside a thread is uncommon but not malicious.\n- Analysis: Safe resource management, no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Benign utility module.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Protocols and cleanup for HTTP clients.\n- Data flow: No external input; manages client objects.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior; proper resource cleanup.\n- Analysis: Standard, safe implementation.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign malware 0, which aligns with the code being purely about resource management and protocol definitions. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is straightforward with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal security concern—primarily because the code manages resources safely and does not process untrusted data or perform network operations beyond what is necessary for cleanup.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is standard, with no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The use of `asyncio.run` inside a thread is somewhat unconventional but is a known pattern for handling cleanup in mixed sync/async contexts, not malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n- The resource cleanup functions are standard and necessary for SDKs managing network connections.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports, reflecting low security risk due to resource management)\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis code is a benign, well-structured resource management utility with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
