  "purpose": "Define protocols for synchronous and asynchronous HTTP clients and a utility function to close these clients, managing resources in an SDK context.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input; it defines interfaces and a cleanup function.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code does not process or output untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only manages client objects and performs cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'close_clients' attempts to close async clients within a thread if called in an async context, which is an unusual pattern but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Protocols for HTTP clients and a cleanup function for resource management. The cleanup function attempts to gracefully close client connections, including handling async clients within threads when necessary. No external data handling, injection points, or suspicious behavior is present. The pattern of using ThreadPoolExecutor to close async clients in an async context is unconventional but appears to be intended for resource management, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard resource management utility for HTTP clients with no evidence of malicious intent. The patterns used are unconventional but not suspicious or harmful. No security risks or malware detected.",
