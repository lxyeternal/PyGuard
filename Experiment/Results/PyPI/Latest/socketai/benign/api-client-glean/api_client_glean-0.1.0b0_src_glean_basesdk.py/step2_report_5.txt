  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard HTTP client SDK with hooks, retries, and environment-based security. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward, and no suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing potential data leakage via logging request/response bodies. While logging sensitive data is a concern, it doesn't imply malicious intent; rather, it's a security best practice to handle logs carefully.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates the standard nature of the SDK, with no malicious patterns. The detailed logging could pose security concerns if sensitive data is logged, but this is a configuration/security practice issue, not malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem accurate.\n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical SDK pattern with no signs of malicious activity. No obfuscation or backdoors. The focus on request construction and security is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; the code is a legitimate SDK with no malicious intent. The mention of potential data exposure via logging is a security concern but not malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, and the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** Set at 0.2 across reports, reflecting a low security risk primarily due to logging practices, not malicious code.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to potential data leakage in logs, but not a significant security threat.\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or high security risk is present. The low risk score reflects good practice with minor security considerations regarding logging.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed to the scores or the overall assessment.",
