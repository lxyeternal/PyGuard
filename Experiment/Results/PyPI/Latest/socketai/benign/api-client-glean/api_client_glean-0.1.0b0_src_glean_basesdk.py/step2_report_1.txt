  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SDK for HTTP requests, reads config, environment variables, request data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Builds requests, potentially sensitive data flows into headers, URL, body.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious anomalies; code appears standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Well-structured, uses environment variables for security, no suspicious code or obfuscation. Logging is for debugging, no sensitive info explicitly logged.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (low). Confidence high (0.9).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SDK, with emphasis on request construction and logging.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Request building, logging request/response, potential data leakage if sensitive data is logged.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials or backdoors; logging could leak sensitive info but is not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard implementation, typical security handling, potential logging concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—HTTP request SDK, with security, retries, hooks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Request construction, network send, logging.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical SDK, no malicious behavior, standard security.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** HTTP SDK, request building, security, retries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Request execution, logging.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard request SDK, with hooks, retries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Request building, sending, response handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical SDK, no signs of malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently rate malware at 0, and no suspicious or malicious activity is detected in the code. The code is a typical HTTP SDK, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk is low (0.2), primarily because the code handles sensitive data and network requests, but nothing indicates malicious intent or security vulnerabilities beyond normal operational risks.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code uses environment variables for security, which is standard.\n- Logging includes request/response details but no explicit sensitive data is mentioned as being logged.\n- No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n\n### Final conclusion:\n**The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK for HTTP requests with no malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements.** The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My personal estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (as per the reports, justified by the handling of sensitive data and logging practices)\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, standard, and does not exhibit malicious characteristics.**",
