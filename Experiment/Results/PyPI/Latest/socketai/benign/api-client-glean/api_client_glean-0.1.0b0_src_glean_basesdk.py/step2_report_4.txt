  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports indicate the code is a standard HTTP SDK with request construction, security handling via environment variables, hooks, retries, and logging.\n   - No reports mention obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n   - The code relies on external utils and hooks, which are typical in SDKs, and no signs of malicious dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors are observed.\n\n2. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**\n   - The logic appears consistent; request building, security, retries, and error handling follow standard patterns.\n   - The only potential concern is extensive logging of request and response bodies, which could risk sensitive data exposure if logs are not properly managed. However, this is a common trade-off in SDKs and not inherently malicious.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are around 0.2, reflecting typical concerns about logging sensitive data rather than actual malicious intent.\n   - Confidence levels are high (0.9), indicating the reviewers believe the code is legitimate.\n\n4. **Potential Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities; they focus on standard request handling.\n   - The concern about logging sensitive data is valid but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis—no malware detected, low security risk, high confidence.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n- The code is a well-structured, standard SDK for HTTP requests.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- Logging of request/response could be a security concern if logs are exposed, but this is a common practice in SDKs, not malicious.\n- Environment-based security handling is typical and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (due to potential sensitive data exposure via logs, but not a serious security flaw)\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is a legitimate SDK implementation with no indicators of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation. The only minor concern relates to verbose logging, which can be mitigated with proper log management.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, legitimate, and intended for standard HTTP request handling. No malicious activity or backdoors are present.",
