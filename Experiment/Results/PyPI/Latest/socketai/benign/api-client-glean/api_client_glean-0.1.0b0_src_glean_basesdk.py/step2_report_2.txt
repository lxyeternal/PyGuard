  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard HTTP SDK with hooks, retries, and environment-based security. No malicious anomalies, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The report assigns malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk score justification:** The security risk is low (0.2), given the code's typical nature and lack of suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; the code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a typical SDK with detailed logging that could leak sensitive data if not managed properly.\n- **Potential concern:** Extensive logging of request/response bodies might inadvertently expose sensitive info. However, no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is justified; no malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Reinforces that the code is a standard SDK, with no signs of malicious activity. The focus is on request construction, security, retries, and hooks.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, matching the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior; the code is legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing that the code is well-structured SDK code with no backdoors or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Confirms that the code is a typical SDK with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, with no evidence of obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher at 0.2 in all reports, justified by the presence of detailed logging and environment-based security handling, which are common in SDKs but could pose risks if logs are improperly managed.\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to potential data leakage through verbose logging; standard for SDKs but warrants cautious log management.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured HTTP SDK with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The primary security concern is careful handling of logs to prevent sensitive data leaks, which is already acknowledged.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- Maintain strict log sanitization to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.\n- Continue monitoring for any dynamic or obfuscated code patterns in future versions.\n\n**Note:** No further security threats or malicious indicators are evident in this code fragment.",
