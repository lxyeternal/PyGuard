{
  "purpose": "A client SDK for retrieving messages from messaging platforms like Slack or Teams, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as id_type, id, environment variables accessed via get_security_from_env, and request serialization functions.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to the API endpoint, response handling, and error raising based on response status codes.",
  "flows": "Parameters are used to construct request objects, which are serialized and sent via HTTP POST; responses are parsed and errors are raised if necessary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Environment variables are used appropriately for security info.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client with proper request construction, serialization, and response/error handling. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. Use of environment variables aligns with best practices. The response handling covers expected status codes, and no suspicious data flows are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK for message retrieval, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
