  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the presence of malicious behavior, code obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Describes a standard API SDK for document permissions, with inputs from parameters and environment variables, and outputs via JSON unmarshaling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses environment variables for security, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) seem appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, standard request/response handling for document retrieval.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, and standard security practices. Reliance on environment variables is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Provides API client functions for document APIs, with inputs from parameters and environment variables.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. Uses environment variables for security configuration.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar API client functions, with standard request/response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious code detected. Environment variables used for security are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Standard SDK for document APIs, with inputs and outputs following typical patterns.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Uses environment variables for security.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. The code is a typical API client SDK with no evidence of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are present.\n- **Security Risk Score:** The overall security risk remains low (around 0.1 to 0.2), primarily because the code relies on environment variables for security configuration, which is standard practice.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n- No changes are necessary; all findings point to a legitimate, well-structured SDK with no malicious intent.\n\n### My Personal Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code with no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (standard security considerations for environment-based security configuration)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be a standard, secure, and legitimate SDK client with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
