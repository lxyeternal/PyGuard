  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, security risks, and logical consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a standard API client SDK for document permissions, with inputs from parameters and environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into HTTP requests; responses are parsed and errors raised.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Uses environment variables for security, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The high confidence and zero malware/obfuscation scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SDK functions, with input parameters and environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard request/response handling, no suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code. Uses environment variables for security.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical API client, safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK for document permissions and retrieval, with inputs from parameters and environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard serialization, request, response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets. Uses environment variables for security.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK for document APIs, with inputs from parameters and environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper request/response flow, error handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Environment variables used for security.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe SDK.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly rated.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK for document permissions and facets, with inputs from parameters and environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Typical request/response pattern, safe error handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or secrets. Uses environment variables appropriately.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports are 0, which aligns with the code's nature as a straightforward API client SDK.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting standard reliance on environment variables for security, not indicating any malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity or code snippets are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, well-structured, and follows standard patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** ~0.1 — considering environment variable reliance is standard, and no suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK with no malicious or obfuscated components. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the context. No modifications are necessary.",
