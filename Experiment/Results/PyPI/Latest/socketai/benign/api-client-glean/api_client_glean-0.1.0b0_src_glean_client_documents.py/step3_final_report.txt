{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Python SDK client for interacting with document permissions and retrieval APIs, facilitating requests and handling responses for document data.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as 'document_id', 'get_documents_request', environment variables accessed via 'get_security_from_env', and request serialization functions.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request construction, response parsing, error raising, and environment variable access for security configuration.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and environment variables feed into request objects; requests are serialized and sent over HTTP; responses are matched and unmarshaled or errors are raised based on status codes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. Uses standard environment variables for security, with no signs of obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured SDK for API interactions. It constructs requests from input parameters and environment variables, serializes request bodies, and handles responses with standard error handling. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. Security relies on environment variables, which is standard practice. Response handling and retry logic are implemented correctly. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure SDK client with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk=0.1—are consistent with the analysis and reflect standard practices.",
