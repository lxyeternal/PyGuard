  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code behavior, potential security issues, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Describes a standard API client SDK for document permissions, with inputs from parameters and environment variables, and outputs via unmarshaled JSON responses or exceptions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Uses environment variables for security, which is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No malicious indicators. The security risk score of 0.2 seems slightly conservative but acceptable given the reliance on environment variables. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, describing a typical API client with standard request/response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, standard practices. Uses environment variables for security.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. The low security risk score reflects standard practices. Malware remains 0, justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Same pattern, standard SDK for document API.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious code detected. Uses environment variables for security.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and justified. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Again, a typical SDK for document retrieval.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. Uses environment variables.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar, standard API client pattern.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Uses environment variables for security.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is a straightforward API client with no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code relies on environment variables for security configuration, and there's no evidence of insecure practices, these are reasonable.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The code is a typical, well-structured SDK for API interactions.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Security Risk Score:** **0.1** (standard environment variable usage, minimal risk)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis, considering the code's nature and the thorough review provided.",
