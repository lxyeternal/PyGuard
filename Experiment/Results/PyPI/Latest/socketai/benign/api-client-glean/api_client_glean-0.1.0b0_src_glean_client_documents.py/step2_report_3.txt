  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently conclude that the code is a standard, well-structured SDK for interacting with a document API.\n- They emphasize the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity.\n- The only noted \"anomalies\" are standard practices such as reliance on environment variables for security, which is typical and not malicious.\n- The malware scores are all 0, and the obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - No evidence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n   - The code performs typical request construction, response parsing, error handling, and retry logic.\n   - No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious variable names.\n   - Uses environment variables for security, which is standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as a standard API client SDK.\n   - They appropriately dismiss the reliance on environment variables as standard practice.\n   - No logical flaws are evident; their conclusions about safety and non-malicious intent are justified.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with no obfuscation detected.\n   - Security risks are low (around 0.1-0.2), justified by standard environment-based security configuration.\n   - The reports' confidence levels (around 0.9-0.95) are reasonable given the thorough reasoning.\n\n4. **Potential for Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No signs of malware such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network-based sabotage.\n   - No suspicious network calls or external data leaks.\n   - Use of get_security_from_env is for security configuration, not malicious purposes.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on standard SDK patterns and lack of suspicious code.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made; the analysis is cautious and justified.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk low.\n   - No need to adjust scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, standard code structure.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1-0.2** — Slightly elevated due to environment variable reliance, but standard practice.\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented SDK for API interaction with no malicious intent or security issues.**\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate after review:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Slightly elevated due to environment variable use, but acceptable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious behavior.",
