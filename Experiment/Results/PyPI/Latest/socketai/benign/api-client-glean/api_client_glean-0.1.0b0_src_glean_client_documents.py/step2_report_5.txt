  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the provided code to verify the claims, identify any inconsistencies, and assess the security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Client SDK for document permissions and retrieval.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, suspicious variables, dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low).\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is a typical API client with standard request construction, response handling, and error management.\n- Usage of `get_security_from_env` indicates environment-based security configuration, which is standard.\n- No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n- The logic flows are straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is accurate. The code appears benign and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** SDK for document management API.\n- **Findings:** Inputs from parameters and environment variables; no unsafe data handling or leaks; standard request/response pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code constructs requests from inputs, serializes them, and handles responses securely.\n- No malicious behaviors or suspicious constructs are evident.\n- Reliance on environment variables for security is standard.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is justified; no malicious activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** SDK for document permissions and metadata.\n- **Findings:** Standard request/response flow; environment variables for security; no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code constructs requests based on parameters and handles responses with proper error handling.\n- No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- Usage of environment variables aligns with best practices.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is correct; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** SDK for document interactions.\n- **Findings:** Constructs requests from inputs; handles responses; no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code performs typical API client functions securely.\n- No suspicious network activity or malicious code segments are present.\n- Environment variables are used for security, which is standard.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is valid; no malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** SDK for document permissions and facets.\n- **Findings:** Standard request/response handling; no secrets or code injection; no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is a typical API client with no signs of malicious activity.\n- No hidden behaviors, data leaks, or suspicious patterns.\n- Uses environment variables for security configuration, which is standard.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is consistent; the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code analysis—no malicious behaviors, no data exfiltration, no suspicious network calls.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting standard risks associated with environment variable reliance and potential misconfigurations, but nothing indicates a significant security flaw.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\nBased on the detailed review:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, standard code structure.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1-0.2** — Typical minimal risks related to environment-based security configuration, not specific vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate; the code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor security risk scores are appropriate given the context, primarily due to reliance on environment variables, which is standard practice but requires proper management.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Recommendations:**\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n- Maintain vigilance on environment variable security but no immediate concerns.\n- Overall, the code is safe and free from malicious intent.",
