  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Report 1 (\"Empty response\")**:\n   - The raw response is empty.\n   - No code issues are directly indicated.\n   - The code includes logic to handle empty responses by raising errors with detailed messages, so this is a network or server-side issue, not code maliciousness.\n   - No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident.\n   - **Assessment**: The code correctly handles empty responses; the issue likely originates from the server or network, not the SDK code itself.\n\n2. **Report 2 (\"Purpose, sources, sinks, anomalies, analysis, conclusion\")**:\n   - Purpose: Standard SDK for collection management via REST API.\n   - Sources: Parameters, environment variables (via `get_security_from_env()`).\n   - Sinks: Request serialization, HTTP requests, response unmarshalling.\n   - Anomalies: No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; standard environment variable usage.\n   - Analysis: Typical API SDK pattern, no malicious behaviors detected.\n   - Conclusion: Legitimate SDK, no signs of malware.\n   - **Assessment**: Well-founded, consistent, and no malicious indicators.\n\n3. **Report 3 (\"Purpose, sources, sinks, anomalies, analysis, conclusion\")**:\n   - Similar to Report 2, with emphasis on standard request/response handling.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n   - Uses environment variables for security info, which is standard.\n   - **Assessment**: No malicious activity detected; the code is a standard API client SDK.\n\n4. **Report 4 (\"Purpose, sources, sinks, anomalies, analysis, conclusion\")**:\n   - Again, consistent with previous reports.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors.\n   - Uses environment variables for security, which is typical.\n   - **Assessment**: No malware or malicious intent detected.\n\n5. **Report 5 (\"Empty response\")**:\n   - Same as Report 1, likely a network/server issue, not code-related.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior**: None.\n- **Obfuscation**: None detected.\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity).\n- **Security risk**: Very low, primarily related to environment variable management, which is standard.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is a typical SDK implementation for REST API interactions.\n- It handles errors and responses appropriately.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- The use of environment variables for security credentials is standard practice, assuming proper environment management outside the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1–0.2 (standard low risk for SDK code with environment variable handling)\n\n**Note**: The \"Empty response\" reports are likely network/server issues, not malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk remains minimal.",
