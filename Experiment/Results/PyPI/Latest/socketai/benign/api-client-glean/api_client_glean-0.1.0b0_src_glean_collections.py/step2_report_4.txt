  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.  \n- **Assessment:** This indicates that a request was made, but no response was received. This could be a network issue, server downtime, or a misconfiguration.  \n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** No malicious code or obfuscation detected. The SDK code is standard, with no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Security Risk:** Low, as no malicious activity is evident. The empty response might be an anomaly, but it doesn't suggest malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malware or malicious behavior. The empty response is likely an external network/server issue.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The report correctly identifies that the code serializes input parameters into request bodies and processes responses.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The use of environment variables for security credentials is standard practice.  \n- **Malware & Security:** Malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.2).  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is a typical SDK with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to previous reports, the flow from input parameters to API request and response handling is standard.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, and standard security practices.  \n- **Malware & Security:** Malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1).  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK code, no malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Again, standard request construction and response handling.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or malicious code detected.  \n- **Malware & Security:** Malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1).  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" similar to Report 1.  \n- **Assessment:** External network/server issue, not code-based malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None. The code is straightforward SDK logic for API interaction.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No evidence of injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Use of environment variables:** Standard practice; ensure environment variables are managed securely outside the code.\n- **Empty responses:** Likely network/server issues, not code issues.\n\n### Final Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation patterns)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (low, primarily due to external environment variable handling, which is standard)\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured SDK for managing collections via REST API. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or supply chain threats are evident. The empty responses are external and unrelated to malicious code.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Confirm that environment variables used for security are securely managed outside the code.  \n- Monitor network responses for persistent empty responses, but these are external issues, not code-based.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis analysis confirms the code's legitimacy and safety based on the provided data.",
