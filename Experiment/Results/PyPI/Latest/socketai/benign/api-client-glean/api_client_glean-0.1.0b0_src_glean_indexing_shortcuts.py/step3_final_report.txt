  "purpose": "SDK methods for bulk indexing shortcuts, handling request construction, retries, and response processing for both synchronous and asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "User-supplied parameters such as 'upload_id', 'shortcuts', 'http_headers', 'server_url', and environment variables accessed via 'get_security_from_env'.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request sending, response handling, and error raising based on response status codes and content.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Request serialization -> HTTP request -> Response reception -> Response validation -> Error handling or success return.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs HTTP requests with user input, manages retries, and processes responses with appropriate error handling. It retrieves security credentials via environment variables, which is standard. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or covert data exfiltration are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the low security risk score (~0.2) reflects typical SDK operation. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with legitimate SDK components, and no vulnerabilities or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK implementation for bulk indexing, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The scores assigned are justified and align with the analysis.",
