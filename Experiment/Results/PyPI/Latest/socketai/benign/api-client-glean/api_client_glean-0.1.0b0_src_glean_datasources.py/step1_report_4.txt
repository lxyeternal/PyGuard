{
  "purpose": "This code manages adding, updating, and retrieving configurations for custom data sources via an API, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "User-supplied parameters in method calls (e.g., name, display_name, url_regex, object_definitions, etc.), environment variables accessed via get_security_from_env, and optional HTTP headers.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request sending functions (_build_request, do_request, do_request_async), where untrusted input data is serialized and transmitted over network calls.",
  "flows": "Parameters provided to methods (sources) are assembled into request objects, serialized, and sent via HTTP requests to API endpoints; responses are processed and returned or errors raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected. Use of environment variables for security indicates standard practice. No obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or malicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an API client to manage data source configurations, performing standard request building, serialization, and response handling. It sanitizes and processes parameters carefully, uses secure environment variables for security info, and handles errors explicitly. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Network interactions are typical for API communication. No suspicious or anomalous code constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SDK component for managing data source configurations, with no evidence of malicious intent or security threats. It handles data securely, performs expected API interactions, and adheres to common coding practices.",
