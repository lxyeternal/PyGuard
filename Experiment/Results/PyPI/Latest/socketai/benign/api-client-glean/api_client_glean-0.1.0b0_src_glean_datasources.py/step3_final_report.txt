  "purpose": "SDK methods for managing datasource configurations via API calls, including adding, updating, and retrieving configs, with parameters and environment-based security.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, environment variables for security, request serialization functions.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request construction, data serialization, network communication, response handling.",
  "flows": "Parameters and environment variables flow into request objects, which are serialized and sent via network requests; responses are processed and errors raised as needed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Use of environment variables is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK for API interactions, employing standard request/response patterns, serialization, and error handling. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The reliance on environment variables for security is typical but warrants proper management. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK for datasource management with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects standard practices and minimal threat level.",
