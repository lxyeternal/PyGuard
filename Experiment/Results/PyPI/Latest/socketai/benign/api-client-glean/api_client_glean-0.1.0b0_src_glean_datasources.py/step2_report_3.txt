  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the logical consistency, evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes SDK methods for managing data sources, reading parameters, and environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard API request/response pattern, no suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no suspicious functions. Uses environment variables for security, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded, high confidence, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No signs of malware or obfuscation. The score of malware 0 and risk 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on API client functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard request execution, serialization, error handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. Uses environment variables for security.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues with the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK for managing datasource configs, similar pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls, response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Environment-based security is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK for datasource management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API interactions, serialization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. Environment variables for security are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-supported, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code analysis; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** API client for datasource configs, with flexible parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard network requests, serialization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Reliance on environment variables is typical, but the report notes this as a potential security concern if misused—this is a valid point but not inherently malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware score (0) and risk score (0.2) are justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard SDK for managing datasource configurations.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports agree on the absence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** The assigned malware scores of 0 across all reports are appropriate. Risk scores are low, reflecting minimal security concern, mainly due to reliance on environment variables which is standard but warrants cautious management.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (standard API client with environment-based security; no significant risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical, well-structured SDK for datasource management, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond standard best practices.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** ~0.1–0.2 (low, due to environment variable reliance)  \n\nThis assessment confirms the code's safety and legitimacy.",
