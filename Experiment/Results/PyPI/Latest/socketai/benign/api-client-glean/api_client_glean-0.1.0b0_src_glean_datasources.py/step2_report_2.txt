  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code behavior, potential security risks, malware indicators, and logical consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as SDK methods for managing data sources, with input parameters and environment-based security via `get_security_from_env`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate description of network requests to specific API endpoints, with data flowing from parameters to HTTP requests.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. The use of environment variables for security is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this is a typical SDK implementation with no malicious intent is well-founded. The high confidence (0.95) and malware score (0) are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code manages datasource configs, with parameters and environment security.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes the HTTP request functions and response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscated code, no malicious payloads. Use of `get_security_from_env` is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid SDK behavior, no signs of malware. The confidence and malware score are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the SDK functions, with parameters and environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly identifies API calls and response processing.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Use of environment variables for security is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this is a legitimate SDK component with no malicious behavior is justified. Malware score remains at 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately states the code manages datasource configs, with parameters and environment security.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes the API request and response flow.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors. Use of environment variables for security is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is a standard SDK component, with a low security risk and malware score.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as an API client for datasource management, with flexible configuration options.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes the serialization, request, and response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious activities. Use of environment variables for security credentials is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The analysis is consistent, and the low security risk and malware score are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports correctly identify the code as SDK methods for managing data sources, with standard request/response flows.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** Use of environment variables for security is standard practice; no suspicious external connections or credential leaks are evident.\n- **Scores & Justification:** The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis. The security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk based on the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, readable, and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Approximately 0.1-0.2, considering environment-based security and standard API interactions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's actual behavior. The code is a typical SDK for data source management with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
