  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard SDK methods for managing data sources, relying on parameters and environment variables for security.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard API request construction, serialization, response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses standard security practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, legitimate SDK code, with high confidence (0.95), malware score 0, obfuscated 0, and low security risk (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. No malicious indicators are evident. The scores are reasonable.  \n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, describing API client functions with standard parameters and environment-based security.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Typical request handling, serialization, error management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. Use of environment variables is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Also appears safe, with a high confidence (0.9), malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code. The scores seem appropriate.  \n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK for managing datasource configs, with input parameters and environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API requests, response processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs, or obfuscation. Use of environment variables is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate SDK, low risk, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nReasoning is consistent. The code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior.  \n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SDK functions, standard API interactions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Request serialization, network calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. Environment variables are used appropriately.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Looks like a normal SDK component, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is accurate. The scores are appropriate.  \n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** API client for managing data sources, with environment variables for security.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard request/response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious activity. External environment reliance is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, low malware risk, scores consistent.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound, and the scores match the code's nature.  \n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Review:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard SDK for API interactions, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Scores:** All around 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern primarily due to reliance on environment variables and standard practices.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious code, payloads, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Low, standard SDK operations with typical security considerations.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code appears safe and legitimate, with no evidence of security threats or malware.",
