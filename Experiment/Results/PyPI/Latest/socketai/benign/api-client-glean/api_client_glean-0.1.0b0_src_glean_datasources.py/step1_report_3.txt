{
  "purpose": "This code provides an SDK interface for managing and retrieving configurations of data sources within the Glean platform, facilitating integration and configuration management.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily read from function parameters (e.g., datasource names, configuration options). External data sources include environment variables (via get_security_from_env) and HTTP request/response streams.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to the Glean API endpoints (/adddatasource, /getdatasourceconfig). Potential data leaks could occur if sensitive data like credentials or URLs are mishandled or exposed in logs or network traffic.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → Request body serialization → HTTP request to Glean API endpoint → Response handling and deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious URLs observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Use of standard request and response handling patterns. No suspicious data exfiltration or backdoors present. Environment variables are accessed via get_security_from_env, which appears to be a secure, controlled mechanism.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements SDK methods for adding and retrieving data source configurations via API calls. It uses secure and well-established patterns such as parameter validation, request serialization, and response unmarshalling. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The only notable aspect is reliance on environment-based security configuration, which is standard practice. No suspicious URL manipulations, code injections, or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SDK component for managing data source configurations within the Glean platform. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation uses standard patterns for API interaction without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
