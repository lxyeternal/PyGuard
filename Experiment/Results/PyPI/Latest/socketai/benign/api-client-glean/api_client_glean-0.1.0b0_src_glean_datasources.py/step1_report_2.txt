{
  "purpose": "The code provides methods for adding, retrieving, and asynchronously managing datasource configurations in a search system, including request building, response handling, and error management.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as 'name', 'datasource_category', 'url_regex', 'object_definitions', 'quicklinks', 'http_headers', and environment-based security info obtained from 'get_security_from_env'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include HTTP request execution via 'do_request' and 'do_request_async', serialization of request bodies, and raising exceptions with detailed error messages.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-supplied parameters into request objects, which are serialized and sent over HTTP. Responses are checked for status codes and content types, with errors raised on unexpected responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. Use of environment variables via 'get_security_from_env' appears standard. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present. All request parameters and response handling appear typical for an API client.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client implementation, constructing requests with user parameters, handling responses, and managing errors appropriately. No signs of malicious code, such as network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are evident. The security-related functions rely on environment variables and standard serialization practices. No suspicious or unusual behaviors are present in the flow logic or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SDK component for managing datasource configurations. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on the provided implementation. It follows typical API interaction patterns and proper error handling.",
