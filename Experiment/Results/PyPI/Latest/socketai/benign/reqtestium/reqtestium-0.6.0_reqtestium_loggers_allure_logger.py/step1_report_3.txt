{
  "purpose": "This code defines a logger class for attaching HTTP request and response details to Allure reports for test documentation and debugging.",
  "sources": "Reads response.request.headers, response.request.body, response.status_code, response.text, response.request, and response.request.body.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs request headers, request bodies, response status codes, response bodies, and curl commands to Allure attachments. No direct sinks to untrusted data streams or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from HTTP response objects into attachments via internal methods, primarily for reporting purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of try-except blocks for JSON decoding is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code inspects HTTP response objects, extracting headers, body content, status code, and curl commands for detailed reporting in Allure. It handles JSON content gracefully, falling back to plain text if JSON parsing fails. All operations are related to report generation and do not process untrusted input in a way that leads to code execution or data exfiltration. No suspicious external network calls or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate logging utility for test reporting with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply formats and attaches HTTP request/response details for debugging purposes.",
