  "purpose": "The code is designed to attach detailed request and response information to allure reports for logging and debugging purposes in testing frameworks.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'response' objects including request headers, request body, response status code, response text, and request URL.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted logs, JSON attachments, curl commands, and headers into allure report attachments.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'response' object to various allure attachments through private static methods that process request/response details and curl commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of json parsing and attaching data is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly extracts and logs request/response details, handling JSON decoding errors gracefully, and attaches them to allure reports. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious network activity. The code functions as a logging utility for debugging purposes within a testing context, with no apparent security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate logging utility for attaching request and response details to allure reports. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and serves a diagnostic purpose.",
