  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall Code Behavior:**\n- The code is a class `AllureLogger` that logs HTTP request and response details into Allure reports.\n- It attaches headers, request/response bodies (JSON or text), status codes, and curl commands.\n- It uses standard libraries (`json`, `curlify`, `allure`) and handles JSON decoding errors gracefully.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The purpose appears to be debugging and reporting during testing.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code functions as intended for logging. No malicious or vulnerable behavior is observed.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The code handles JSON decoding errors properly, and the logic is straightforward. No evident flaws.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - `malware`: 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature.\n  - `securityRisk`: 0.1 in all reports, indicating minimal risk—reasonable given the code's purpose.\n  - `obfuscated`: 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The code **does not** perform any network activity beyond attaching request/response data.\n- It **does not** execute or evaluate untrusted data beyond attaching it to reports.\n- The use of `curlify` is standard for debugging, not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores for malware should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score at 0.1 seems appropriate, reflecting minimal risk.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9-1), which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, typical for logging utilities)\n\n**The reports are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a legitimate, straightforward logging utility for attaching HTTP request/response details to Allure reports. It handles data safely, with proper error handling, and does not exhibit any malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the benign, transparent nature of the code.",
