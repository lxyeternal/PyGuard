{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to log HTTP request and response details for debugging or reporting purposes, specifically attaching headers, bodies, and curl commands to Allure reports.",
  "sources": "Response object, specifically response.request.headers, response.request.body, response.status_code, response.text, response.json(), and response.request (for curl commands).",
  "sinks": "Allure attachments that could potentially include untrusted or sensitive data such as request headers, request/response bodies, and curl commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the Response object (response.request headers, body, response content) to Allure report attachments via various static methods. No data is sent externally; flow is local for logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of try-except blocks is for JSON parsing and is standard. No suspicious or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for JSON handling, allure reporting, and HTTP response processing. It defines a class AllureLogger with methods to attach request and response details and curl commands to allure reports. Attachments include headers, bodies (JSON or text), status codes, and curl commands generated from the request. The data is purely for reporting; no external data transmission or suspicious code behavior is present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code constructs are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a logging utility for HTTP interactions using Allure, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It responsibly handles data for debugging purposes without evident security risks.",
