  "purpose": "The code defines a logging utility that attaches request and response details to allure reports for testing and debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "response.request.headers, response.request.body, response.status_code, response.text, response.json()",
  "sinks": "Allure attachment points, especially attaching request and response bodies, headers, and curl commands to reports",
  "flows": "Input data from response.request and response objects flow into allure attachments for reporting",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to attach request headers, body, response status, and body to allure reports. It handles JSON parsing errors gracefully and formats JSON content. The use of curlify to generate curl commands is standard for debugging. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging utility for enhancing test reports with detailed request/response data. No malicious intent or malicious behavior detected. It is designed for debugging purposes and maintains standard practices.",
