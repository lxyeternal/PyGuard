{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to attach detailed HTTP request and response information to Allure reports for debugging and testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the response object, specifically response.request.headers, response.request.body, response.status_code, and response.text.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data from request headers, request body, response text, and JSON content are attached to Allure reports, which could potentially expose sensitive information if logs are accessed improperly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the response object (request headers, body, response status, and response text) into Allure attachments via dedicated methods, with JSON decoding attempts and curl command generation as auxiliary steps.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code handles JSON decoding errors gracefully and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a logging utility that captures HTTP request and response details for reporting. It uses standard libraries and handles potential JSON errors without exposing vulnerabilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external network activity. The data attached could include sensitive information, but this is typical for debugging logs and not inherently malicious. The code structure is clear, and the logic is straightforward, focusing solely on attaching data to reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured logging utility intended for attaching HTTP request and response details to Allure reports. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The low security risk score (~0.1) is justified due to potential exposure of sensitive data in logs, which is a common consideration in such utilities. The malware score remains at 0, indicating no malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
