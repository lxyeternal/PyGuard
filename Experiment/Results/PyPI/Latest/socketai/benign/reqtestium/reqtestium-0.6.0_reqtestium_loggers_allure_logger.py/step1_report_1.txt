{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to log HTTP request and response details using the Allure reporting framework, including headers, body, status code, and curl commands.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'response.request.headers', 'response.request.body', and 'response' object attributes such as 'status_code', 'text', and 'json()' method.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include Allure attachments containing request headers, request body, response status code, response body, and curl command, which are primarily for debugging and reporting.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the response object to the attachment functions, which format and attach request/response details to the Allure report.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or malicious code is present. Use of standard libraries and straightforward data handling suggests no malicious intent. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'AllureLogger' with static methods that attach request and response details to Allure reports. It carefully handles JSON decoding and fallback text attachments. No external inputs, network communications, or potential injection points are present. The use of standard libraries and clear separation of concerns indicates a benign purpose focused on logging for testing or debugging.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate logging utility intended for detailed reporting of HTTP requests and responses during testing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
