{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility classes for handling and asserting properties of API responses and JSON data during testing or validation processes.",
  "sources": "Code reads response data via the 'requests' library response object, JSON payloads, and class method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and validation functions that compare values, schemas, or status codes, which are based on data sources. No external data outputs or network calls are directly present.",
  "flows": "Response object data flows into JSON parsing, then into various validation and assertion methods, including schema validation and status code checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code relies on standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility for API response validation. It uses assertions and external validation libraries correctly, with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert network activity. The use of 'allure' is for reporting, not malicious purposes. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present. Overall, the code performs validation and assertion functions typical in testing frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard testing utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs response validation and JSON schema checks securely and appropriately.",
