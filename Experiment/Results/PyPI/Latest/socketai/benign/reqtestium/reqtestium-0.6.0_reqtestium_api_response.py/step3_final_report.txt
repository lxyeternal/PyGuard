  "flows": "Response data -> validation/assertion methods -> error reporting or exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard use of assertions, external libraries, and reporting tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward testing utility for API responses, utilizing common libraries like 'requests', 'jsonschema', and 'allure'. It performs data assertions, schema validation, and reporting, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of assertions and reporting functions is typical for testing environments. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data flows are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be adjusted to 0 given the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for API response validation with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the initial reports are accurate; the overall security risk is negligible. No further action is necessary.",
