  "conclusion": "The code is likely benign but contains patterns (eval/exec) that could be exploited maliciously. The malware score is set at 0.5, and security risk at 0.45, indicating moderate concern primarily due to dynamic execution patterns. Other reports are consistent with benign code, and no obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected."
