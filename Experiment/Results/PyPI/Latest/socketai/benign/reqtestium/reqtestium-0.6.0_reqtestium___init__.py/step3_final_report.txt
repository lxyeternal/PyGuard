  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Dynamic command execution (eval/exec), environment variables, input/output functions, dependency management modules.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network requests, file operations, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, user input) potentially flow into eval/exec or system calls; outputs to files, network, or console.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec without validation, dynamic command execution, minimal validation, potential reliance on environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits dynamic command execution which poses inherent risks, but no explicit malicious payloads or backdoors are detected. The absence of hardcoded secrets and obfuscation suggests benign intent. The primary concern is the potential misuse of eval/exec, which could be exploited if untrusted input is processed. The confidence in benign nature is high, but the security risk is elevated due to dynamic execution. Scores are adjusted to reflect the potential danger of such patterns, with malware likelihood set at 0.5 and overall security risk around 0.45.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely benign but contains patterns (eval/exec) that could be exploited maliciously. The malware score is set at 0.5, and security risk at 0.45, indicating moderate concern primarily due to dynamic execution patterns. Other reports are consistent with benign code, and no obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected.",
