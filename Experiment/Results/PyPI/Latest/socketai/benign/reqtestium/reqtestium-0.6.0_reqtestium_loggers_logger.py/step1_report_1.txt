  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for logging HTTP responses",
  "sources": "Import statements for abc and Response from requests; method parameter response",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sinks or external effects",
  "flows": "Method signature indicates potential for response object to be processed, but no actual flow or data handling shown",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines an abstract class LoggerProtocol with an abstract method log_request that takes a Response object. There are no implementations or data processing. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present, and no hardcoded secrets or malicious code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard interface definition for logging HTTP responses, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
