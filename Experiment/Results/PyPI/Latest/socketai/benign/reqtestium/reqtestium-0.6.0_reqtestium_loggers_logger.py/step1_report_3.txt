{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for logging HTTP responses following a protocol/interface pattern.",
  "sources": "Imports Response from the requests library, and defines an abstract method expecting a Response object as input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present, as the code only defines a class and method signature without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines an abstract class with a single abstract method. There are no data handling, input reading, or output operations. It does not perform any logic, network activity, or data manipulation. The use of an abstract class is standard for defining interfaces or protocols. No potential security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet solely establishes an interface for logging responses and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign part of a larger codebase.",
