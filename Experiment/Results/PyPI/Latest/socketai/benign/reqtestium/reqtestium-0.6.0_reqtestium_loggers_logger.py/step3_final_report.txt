  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for logging HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "The Response object passed to log_request method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; method is abstract with no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward interface with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports ABC and abstractmethod to define an abstract class LoggerProtocol with a single abstract method log_request accepting a Response object. It contains no implementation, data handling, or external effects. The code is standard for defining protocols/interfaces in Python. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the benign, non-executable nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface definition with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
