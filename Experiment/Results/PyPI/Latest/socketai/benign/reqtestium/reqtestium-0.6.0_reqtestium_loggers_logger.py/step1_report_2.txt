{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract logging protocol for HTTP responses",
  "sources": "Response object from the requests library",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as the abstract method is unimplemented and no data is processed",
  "flows": "Response data can be passed to log_request method, but not used in this code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a simple abstract class definition",
  "analysis": "The code imports abstract base class tools and the Response class. It defines an abstract class LoggerProtocol with an abstract method log_request that takes a Response object. There are no implementations, data processing, or untrusted input handling present. The code appears to be a straightforward protocol interface with no malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple interface definition for logging HTTP responses and does not contain any malicious or security-related issues. It is standard, non-malicious code.",
