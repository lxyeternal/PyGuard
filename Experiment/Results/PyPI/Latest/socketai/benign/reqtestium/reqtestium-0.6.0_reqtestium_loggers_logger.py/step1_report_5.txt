  "purpose": "Define an abstract protocol for logging HTTP responses",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the Response object passed to log_request method",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or stored unsafely",
  "flows": "Response object is passed to log_request; no further data flow is demonstrated",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard Python features",
  "analysis": "The code imports ABC and abstractmethod to define an abstract class. It also imports Response from requests, likely used as input data for the logging method. The class defines an abstract method log_request, which expects a Response object. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to serve as a protocol/interface for logging responses without performing any actions itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard abstract class for logging HTTP responses. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The structure and content are typical for interface definitions in Python.",
