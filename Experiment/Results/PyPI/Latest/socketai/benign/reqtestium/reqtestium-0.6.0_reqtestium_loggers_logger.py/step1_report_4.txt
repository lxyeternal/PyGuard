  "purpose": "Define an abstract protocol for logging HTTP responses",
  "sources": "Importing Response class from requests module",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present in the provided code",
  "flows": "None, as the code only defines an abstract class and method signature without execution flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports ABC and abstractmethod for defining an abstract base class, which is used to create a protocol for logging HTTP responses. The class 'LoggerProtocol' includes an abstract method 'log_request' that takes a Response object. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are processed or handled directly. The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The use of 'Response' from 'requests' is standard and limited to type annotation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract class definition intended for logging HTTP responses. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and does not interact with untrusted sources directly. Overall, it is safe and serves as a protocol template.",
