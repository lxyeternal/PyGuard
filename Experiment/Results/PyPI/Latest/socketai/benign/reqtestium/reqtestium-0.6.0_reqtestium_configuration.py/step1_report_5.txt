{
  "purpose": "Define a configuration class for managing base URL, headers, and loggers in a request testing framework.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: base_url, loggers, headers",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data sinks or untrusted data handling that could lead to security issues",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to class attributes without processing; no data flow leading to vulnerabilities",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The import path 'reqtestium.loggers.logger' is standard for logging modules; nothing suspicious in the class definition",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple Configuration class with an initializer setting attributes based on parameters. It imports a LoggerProtocol but does not instantiate or invoke it in a suspicious manner. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or risky operations are present. The parameters are typical for a configuration object, and there are no evident malicious behaviors or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration class without malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a data container for test setup parameters.",
