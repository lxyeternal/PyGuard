  "purpose": "Define a Configuration class for managing base URL, headers, and loggers for an HTTP or test framework.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: base_url (string), loggers (list of LoggerProtocol), headers (dict).",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data leading to data leak or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters to instance variables without external influence or further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. Usage of an external protocol (LoggerProtocol) is standard for dependency injection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward class with an initializer that assigns provided parameters to instance variables. It uses type hints for clarity. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The class appears to be a simple configuration holder, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious configuration class with no security issues or malware indications. It solely manages data storage for configuration parameters.",
