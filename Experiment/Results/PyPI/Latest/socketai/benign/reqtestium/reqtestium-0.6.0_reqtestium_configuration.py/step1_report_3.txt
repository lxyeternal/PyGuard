  "purpose": "Define a Configuration class for managing base URL, loggers, and headers in a testing framework.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: base_url, loggers, headers",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file writes, or eval",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned directly to class attributes; no data flow to external sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; straightforward class constructor",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an initializer that assigns parameters to instance variables. It imports a logger protocol from an external module. No malicious or suspicious behavior is apparent. The code does not execute untrusted code, access environment variables, or perform network operations. It appears to be a simple configuration holder suitable for a testing framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malware features.",
