  "purpose": "Define a Configuration class for setting up base URL, headers, and loggers, likely for a web testing or HTTP client setup.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: base_url (string), loggers (list), headers (dict).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data processed into sensitive operations or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters assigned directly to instance variables without transformation or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious imports or code patterns. The imported module is a logger interface, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple Configuration class with an initializer setting attributes based on provided parameters. It imports a LoggerProtocol interface but does not instantiate or invoke it within this snippet. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious logic is present. The code appears to be standard configuration setup for a larger application, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration class for managing URL, headers, and loggers. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It appears to be part of a larger, benign application setup.",
