  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple class for configuration management.\n- The code imports a LoggerProtocol from an external module but does not instantiate or invoke it in any suspicious way.\n- There are no signs of data leaks, untrusted data processing, or malicious behavior.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is straightforward, with parameters assigned directly to instance variables.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n- Confidence is high (1), which is reasonable given the clear, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or points of challenge:**\n- The only aspect that could be questioned is whether importing `LoggerProtocol` might be part of a malicious pattern if the module is compromised. However, since the report states it's a standard external module and no further malicious behavior is observed, this is unlikely.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are justified based solely on this code snippet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The scores reflect the benign nature accurately.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis code is a straightforward configuration class with no signs of malicious or risky behavior.",
