{
  "purpose": "Defines a Configuration class for managing base URL, headers, and loggers in a logging or testing context.",
  "sources": "Initialization of parameters: base_url, loggers, headers.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no data leaks or unsafe operations identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters assigned to instance variables; no data flow leading to untrusted sink or malicious action.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition with an initializer that assigns input parameters to instance variables. It imports a LoggerProtocol from an external module, which appears to be a protocol or interface for logging. There are no functions or methods that process data beyond assignment. No insecure or malicious behavior is evident, and the code does not interact with external systems or sensitive data beyond storing input parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard class for configuration purposes, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply stores provided configuration data for later use.",
