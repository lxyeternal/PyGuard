{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Configuration class that encapsulates base URL, loggers, and headers for use in a larger application, serving as a data container without executing or processing data.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed into __init__ (base_url, loggers, headers)",
  "sinks": "Assignment of parameters to instance variables; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks identified",
  "flows": "Direct assignment from input parameters to object attributes without processing or transformation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; import of LoggerProtocol from an external module is standard and unused in a malicious context",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class for storing configuration data, with no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious behavior. It imports a protocol for logging but does not instantiate or invoke it in a suspicious manner. The parameters are assigned directly to attributes, which is typical for configuration classes. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external system interactions are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration holder with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
