{
  "purpose": "A logging class that outputs HTTP request and response details to the console for debugging and monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'response' object, including request method, URL, headers, body, and response status, text, and JSON content.",
  "sinks": "Logs formatted request and response details via the logger; output is directed to the console (stdout).",
  "flows": "Response object data flows from the HTTP response to the formatting functions (_format_request_details, _format_response_details), then to the logger.info calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or hidden code. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution. The code appears straightforward and standard for logging purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a ConsoleLogger class implementing a logger for HTTP request-response cycles, capturing request method, URL, headers, body, response status, and body. It formats data into readable logs and outputs to console. No suspicious code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. It does not perform any network operations outside of formatting the 'response' object, nor does it handle sensitive data insecurely. It safely handles JSON parsing and logs errors if formatting fails. The code’s purpose is diagnostic logging; it does not include data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility for HTTP responses with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation. It is safe for use in production environments from a security perspective.",
