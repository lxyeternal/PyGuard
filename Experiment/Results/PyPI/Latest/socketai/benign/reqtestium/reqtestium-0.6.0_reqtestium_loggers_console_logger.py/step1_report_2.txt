{
  "purpose": "The code defines a console-based logger for HTTP responses, formatting and outputting request and response details for debugging or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads request data (method, URL, headers, body) from the 'response' object, specifically from 'response.request' and 'response.text'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs logs via the 'logging' module, which could expose sensitive request/response data if logged improperly. No external sinks or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'response' object to formatting functions (_format_request_details, _format_response_details) and then to logging outputs via self.logger.info or self.logger.error.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard logging and request/response handling without obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger that outputs to the console, formats request and response details including headers and body, and logs these details. No user input manipulation, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. The data being logged includes request method, URL, headers, and bodies, which could be sensitive if not properly secured, but this is typical for debugging. There are exception handlers to prevent crashes, and no external network or file access beyond logging is performed. The code appears safe and intended solely for debugging or informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility for HTTP request-response cycles, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage. It responsibly logs detailed request and response data for debugging. No security risks are evident beyond the potential exposure of sensitive data via logs, which is a common concern but not malicious. Overall, it is a benign, standard utility code.",
