  "purpose": "A console logger for HTTP request and response details, intended for debugging and monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Response object attributes: request method, URL, headers, body; response status code, text, and JSON content.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to console; potential exposure of sensitive data if logs are insecure.",
  "flows": "Request data is formatted and logged before response data; no external data flows or network activity beyond the response object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with proper error handling for JSON decoding.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard console logger that formats and logs HTTP request and response details. It uses Python's logging module, handles JSON errors gracefully, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious code. The potential security concern is logging sensitive data, but this is typical for debugging tools and not malicious. The code's structure and logic are clear, with no suspicious patterns or external malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility for HTTP interactions. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor security risk score reflects the potential exposure of sensitive data in logs, which is a common concern but not indicative of malicious intent.",
