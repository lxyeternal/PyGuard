{
  "purpose": "The code provides a console-based logger for HTTP request and response details, intended for debugging or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads response object data such as request method, URL, headers, body, and response status, body, and text.",
  "sinks": "Logs formatted request and response details using Python's logging module; no data is directly written to external systems or files beyond logging.",
  "flows": "Response object data (headers, body, URL, status) flows from the response into formatted strings, which are then logged via the logger.info method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard request-response logging with JSON formatting and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a ConsoleLogger class that initializes a logger with console output settings. It includes methods to format request and response details, safely handling JSON decoding errors. The log_request method logs both request and response details. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code's structure and content are typical for a logging utility used for debugging or monitoring network interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign request-response logger with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Its purpose appears to be for debugging and monitoring network interactions.",
