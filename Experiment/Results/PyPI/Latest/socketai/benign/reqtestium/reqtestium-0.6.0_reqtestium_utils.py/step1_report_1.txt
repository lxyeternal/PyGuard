{
  "purpose": "The code formats the differences between two data structures using DeepDiff, producing a diff-like string output.",
  "sources": "The function accepts 'diff' (a dictionary) as input, which is generated by DeepDiff, and also takes 'expected' and 'actual' data inputs for comparison.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly processes and formats data in memory.",
  "flows": "DeepDiff generates a diff dictionary from expected and actual data; format_diff processes this diff to produce a string; get_diff calls format_diff with the diff.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and primarily for formatting differences.",
  "analysis": "The code imports DeepDiff to compute differences between two data structures and then formats these differences into a human-readable form similar to git diff output. The functions are simple, with no use of eval, exec, or other dynamic code execution. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network operations, and no suspicious logic. The code operates solely in memory, processing input data and returning formatted strings. Its purpose appears to be for testing or comparison of data structures, with no evident malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for formatting diffs between data structures. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is negligible.",
