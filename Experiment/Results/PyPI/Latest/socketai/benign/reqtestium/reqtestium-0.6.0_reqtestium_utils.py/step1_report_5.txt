{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to generate a diff-like string representation of differences between two data structures, primarily for debugging or comparison purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via function parameters 'diff', 'expected', and 'actual'. It does not read from external sources or untrusted input streams directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is sent to external systems, network, or file system. The functions only process and return strings based on provided data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves receiving 'expected' and 'actual' data, computing their differences using DeepDiff, and formatting the results for display. No untrusted data flows into external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard open-source library (deepdiff) and defines functions to process and format differences between data structures. No external data sources are accessed, and no network or file operations are performed. The functions mainly manipulate dictionaries and strings without executing untrusted code or using eval-like functions. No suspicious patterns or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for diff formatting with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on data passed as function arguments and returns formatted strings. It does not perform any network, file, or system modifications. Overall, the code appears safe.",
