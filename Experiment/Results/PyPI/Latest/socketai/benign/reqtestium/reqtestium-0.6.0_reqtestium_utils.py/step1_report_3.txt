{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to compute and format differences between two data structures, similar to git diff output.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'diff', 'expected', and 'actual' which are data structures (dict, list, etc.) used for comparison.",
  "sinks": "The functions process data internally and output formatted strings. There are no sinks that handle untrusted external input directly or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'expected' and 'actual' inputs to 'DeepDiff', then to the 'format_diff' function, which processes the diff object and produces a formatted string output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries and simple string formatting. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'DeepDiff' for comparing data structures and defines two functions: 'format_diff' to convert the diff dictionary into a human-readable string, and 'get_diff' to generate the diff between two values. The functions include comprehensive handling of different diff types (value changes, additions, removals, type changes). No external inputs are processed insecurely; outputs are purely formatted strings. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, no external network calls, and no execution of untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for data comparison and formatting, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms. Overall, the code is safe.",
