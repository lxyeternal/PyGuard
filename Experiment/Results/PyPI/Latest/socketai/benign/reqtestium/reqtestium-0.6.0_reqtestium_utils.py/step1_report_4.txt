{
  "purpose": "The code formats the output of DeepDiff comparisons into a git diff-like string for easier visualization of differences between data structures.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'diff', 'expected', and 'actual' provided to functions; the 'DeepDiff' module import.",
  "sinks": "The 'DeepDiff' module potentially processes untrusted data if misused externally; string formatting outputs.",
  "flows": "DeepDiff computes differences (source) between 'expected' and 'actual'; the results are formatted into a string for display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no obfuscated code. Uses only standard library and 'deepdiff' library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'deepdiff' to compare data structures. 'format_diff' processes the diff dictionary, converting it into a human-readable diff-like string. 'get_diff' computes the diff with ignore_order=True, then formats the result. No dynamic code execution, no data leaks, no network activity, and no suspicious logic are present. The code solely focuses on data comparison and formatting. The use of 'deepdiff' library is standard for diffing data structures. The functions are straightforward and do not contain hidden malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data comparison and formatting with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on the 'deepdiff' library for diffing, which is a standard tool. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
