  "purpose": "Utility functions to compare two data structures and format the differences into a human-readable diff-like string.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'expected' and 'actual' in get_diff; diff dictionary generated by DeepDiff.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only processes data in memory and returns strings.",
  "flows": "DeepDiff compares 'expected' and 'actual' -> format_diff processes the diff dict -> returns formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data handling; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports DeepDiff, defines format_diff to convert diff dict into a git-diff style string, and get_diff to generate the diff. It only processes data passed as arguments, with no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The functions are simple, transparent, and rely on a well-known library. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's logic is safe, and the diff formatting is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for data comparison and formatting. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior is detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, aligning with the code's straightforward nature.",
