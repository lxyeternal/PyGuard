{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate a diff-like string representation of differences between two data structures, primarily for comparison and debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Inputs to the functions 'format_diff' and 'get_diff' (diff, expected, actual). No external data sources or user input reading is present.",
  "sinks": "The functions output formatted diff strings; no data is sent to external systems, network, or files.",
  "flows": "The data flows from input parameters through the diff processing functions and results in a formatted string output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code uses standard library 'deepdiff' without any obfuscation or hidden operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'deepdiff' to perform detailed comparison of data structures. It processes the diff dictionary to produce a human-readable diff format. Functions are straightforward, performing data formatting with no dynamic code execution or external communication. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious operations are present. The code relies on a well-known library and standard data handling procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for formatting differences between data structures. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious activities, or security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for use in debugging or testing environments.",
