  "purpose": "Define a GPU-accelerated particle field visualization class with shape generation, morphing, color schemes, and interaction capabilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements; self.noise (OpenSimplex), self._generators functions; environment variables; external data inputs via methods (e.g., from_dataframe, load_custom_points).",
  "sinks": "self._update_colors (color computation), _init_canvas (visualization setup), set_data (visuals), app.Timer (scheduling events).",
  "flows": "Initialization uses generators and external data; morphing involves interpolating positions with noise and swirl; color updating involves noise-based hue and saturation calculations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of OpenSimplex noise for color and morph effects is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external connections; noise seed fixed (0); no obfuscated code or unusual language features; no file I/O or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a particle visualization system with shape generation, color schemes, morphing, and interaction. It imports standard libraries, uses OpenSimplex noise seeded for reproducibility, and employs visual rendering with VisPy. The methods include position updates, color adjustments, and scheduled callbacks. No code suggests malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, network connections outside visualization, or backdoors. The noise usage appears to be for visual effects only, and no external data is transmitted or executed dynamically beyond visualization updates.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate visualization class focused on rendering and morphing particle shapes with color effects. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It leverages noise for visual dynamics, uses standard libraries, and has no network or security-related operations. Overall, it is a safe, purpose-driven implementation.",
