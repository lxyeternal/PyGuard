{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for various 3D shape generator functions and a ParticleField class, validating output shapes, data types, bounds, and class behaviors.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters for shape functions and ParticleField initialization, and data from numpy arrays and pandas DataFrames used in tests.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or external data exfiltration points; the code operates entirely in-memory for testing purposes.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and test data flow into shape generator functions and ParticleField methods; outputs are validated within the test assertions without external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present. The code is straightforward and standard for testing scientific or graphical functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite verifying shape generation functions and ParticleField behaviors. It performs no external communications, no malicious activities, and contains no obfuscation. All signals indicate benign, well-structured testing code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's nature. Minor conservative risk scores (0.1) are acceptable but could be lowered to zero, given the absence of any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward test suite with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use, and the reported scores accurately reflect its benign nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
