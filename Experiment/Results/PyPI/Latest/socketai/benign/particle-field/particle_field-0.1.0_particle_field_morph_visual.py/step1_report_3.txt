{
  "purpose": "The code defines a GPU-based visual for morphing point sets using GLSL shaders, intended for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data includes source, swarm, target point sets, colors, sizes, and axes; these are passed during initialization as numpy arrays converted to vertex buffers.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that could lead to data leaks, command injection, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data flows from initialization inputs (source, swarm, target, axes, colors, sizes) into GPU buffers; uniforms like u_progress and u_swirl control shader behavior; draw method renders points with current shader parameters.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code constructs. Shader code is straightforward and intended for visualization. No network communication or system modification code present.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a visual object that performs GPU-based point morphing with configurable parameters. It uses standard GPU shader techniques for animation and rendering, with no suspicious or malicious features. The code strictly manages visual data and rendering parameters without external side effects or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate visualization tool for morphing point data using GLSL shaders. It does not contain any malicious or sabotage behavior. No security concerns are evident from the provided code.",
