  "purpose": "Create a GPU-based morphing point visual using GLSL shaders for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input arrays: source, swarm, target, colors, sizes, axes; data conversion via numpy.asarray.",
  "sinks": "Shader uniforms and attributes: u_progress, u_swirl, u_transform; GPU shader program execution.",
  "flows": "Input data → GPU buffers (attributes) → shader program (vertex and fragment shaders) → rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. No external network or file system access. Usage of standard visualization libraries and shaders.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a visual component for rendering points with morphing and swirling effects entirely on GPU via GLSL shaders. It sets up vertex attributes for source, swarm, target positions, axes, colors, sizes, and uniforms for progress, swirl, and transformation matrices. No network, file, or environment variable interactions are present. No obfuscated code or malicious code execution paths are detected. The shader code performs standard mathematical transformations for visual effects. The data handling is straightforward and uses common visualization libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard visualization component with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It relies on common visualization patterns and libraries without any signs of malware or security risks.",
