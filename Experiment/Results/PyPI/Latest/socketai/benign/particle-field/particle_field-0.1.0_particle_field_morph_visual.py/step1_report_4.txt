{
  "purpose": "The code defines a GPU-accelerated visual for morphing between three point sets using GLSL shaders, intended for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data provided during initialization: source points, swarm points, target points, axes, colors, sizes; data stored in numpy arrays; user can set uniforms u_progress, u_swirl, and transformation matrices.",
  "sinks": "Shader programs process data; no direct untrusted input handling or data leaks observed. No network operations, file access, or external system calls.",
  "flows": "Initialization loads data into GPU buffers; uniforms set control parameters; draw function renders points based on shader computations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Code structure is typical for a visualization class using Vispy and GLSL. No obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or malicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a GPU-based point visual with morphing and swirling effects, utilizing GLSL shaders for computations. It loads data into GPU buffers, manages shader uniforms, and renders points. There are no external system calls, network operations, or suspicious data manipulations. The data handling and shader code appear legitimate and typical for visualization tasks. The code does not contain any malicious payload or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard visualization class for GPU-accelerated point morphing, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for rendering visual effects without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
