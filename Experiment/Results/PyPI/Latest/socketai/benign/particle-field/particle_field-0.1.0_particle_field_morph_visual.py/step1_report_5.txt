{
  "purpose": "The code defines a GPU-accelerated visual for morphing point sets using GLSL shaders, intended for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays: source points, swarm points, target points, axes, colors, sizes; uses GPU uniforms and matrices.",
  "sinks": "GPU shader code execution; no direct data leaks or external communication; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Data from input arrays is uploaded to GPU buffers (sources, swarm, target, axes, colors, sizes), then used in vertex shader for processing; uniform variables control morphing and transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Shader code is standard for visualization; no obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a GPU-based visual with GLSL shaders for morphing points; data buffers are populated with numpy arrays, and shader uniforms control the visual effects. The shader code implements standard morphing and swirl effects without malicious logic. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious system commands are present. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate visualization component without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard GPU visualization tool using GLSL shaders for morphing point clouds. It does not contain malware or security risks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows are detected. The code is safe and intended for graphical rendering.",
