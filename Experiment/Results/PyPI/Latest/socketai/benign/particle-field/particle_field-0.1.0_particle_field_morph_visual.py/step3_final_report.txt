  "purpose": "GPU-based morphing point visual using GLSL shaders, interpolating between source, swarm, and target point sets with optional swirling effects.",
  "sources": "Input numpy arrays for source, swarm, target points, axes, sizes, and colors; data is loaded into GPU buffers during initialization.",
  "sinks": "GPU buffers and shader uniforms/attributes used during rendering; no external network or file system activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from numpy arrays into GPU buffers, then through shader attributes and uniforms during draw calls to produce visual output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external system interactions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward visualization class utilizing standard GLSL shaders for morphing effects. It loads data into GPU buffers, sets uniform parameters for progress and swirl, and renders points without external communication or malicious logic. The shaders perform typical mathematical transformations for visual effects. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The data handling and shader code are clear and standard, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign GPU visualization component for morphing point clouds, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, clear, and free of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
