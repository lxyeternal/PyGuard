{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate 3D point clouds for various geometric and artistic shapes, intended for visualization or modeling purposes.",
  "sources": "The functions read input parameters such as count, size, and shape-specific parameters; no external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or file I/O; data remains within local numpy arrays.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical formulas and random sampling within each function, producing numpy array outputs representing point clouds.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of mathematical shape generation functions using numpy and random sampling. No external data, network activity, or system modifications are present. The functions are purpose-driven, generating points on spheres, cubes, pyramids, tori, galaxies, waves, helices, Lissajous curves, spirals, and trefoil knots. The implementation is clear, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware scores are appropriately zero, and the security risk scores are minimal, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility library for generating 3D point clouds with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis and the code's benign purpose.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
