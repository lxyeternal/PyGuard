{
  "purpose": "This module generates various 3D point distributions such as geometric shapes, spirals, and other patterns, primarily for visualization or modeling purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as count (number of points) and size for each shape; uses np.random for random point generation in cube, pyramid, galaxy, wave, helix, lissajous, spiral, and cube functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; no code writes data to network, files, or environment variables. No use of untrusted input streams or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (count, size, optional parameters) -> random number generation or mathematical calculations -> output numpy array of points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or unusual data handling. The code solely performs geometric point generation with standard libraries and functions; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple functions generating 3D point clouds for various shapes and patterns. All functions use numpy for calculations and random number generation, with no external network or system calls. No obfuscated language features or malicious logic are present. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are found. The functions serve legitimate purposes related to visualization or geometry.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for generating 3D point distributions, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It relies on numpy and standard Python functions for calculations and randomness, with no suspicious patterns or backdoors.",
