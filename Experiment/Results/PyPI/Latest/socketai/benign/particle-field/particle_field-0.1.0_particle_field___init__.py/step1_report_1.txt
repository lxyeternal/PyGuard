{
  "purpose": "This code provides imports and exports for a GPU-accelerated particle morphing library, including various shape generators and a ParticleField class.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module (.field), which may load external code; local shape generation functions imported from .shapes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication; no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only performs imports and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a try-except block for optional import suggests handling missing dependencies, but no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module setup, importing classes and functions for use elsewhere, with fallback handling for missing dependencies. It does not contain any code execution based on external input, network activity, or other typical malware indicators. No obfuscation or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that facilitates particle shape generation and visualization, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
