{
  "purpose": "This code provides imports and exports for a GPU-accelerated particle morphing library, including different shape generators and a particle field class.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local modules '.field' and '.shapes' for importing classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing specific classes and functions from local modules and exposing them via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a try-except block for importing 'ParticleField' which silently fails if import fails, but this is a standard pattern, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles module imports and defines an export list. The try-except block for 'ParticleField' ensures compatibility if the module isn't available, which is common in optional dependencies. No suspicious or malicious logic, data leaks, or security risks are evident. The code structure is straightforward, with no hidden or obfuscated components.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard, benign module setup for a particle morphing library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
