  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward module setup with optional import handling. No suspicious patterns, external communication, or malicious logic detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard import/export setup with no malicious behavior. The handling of missing dependencies is appropriate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard module interface with optional dependency handling. No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=0.9. Slightly lower, but still reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous assessments; straightforward import setup, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar benign setup, with a minor note that securityRisk is 0.1, possibly reflecting cautiousness about the optional import pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Slightly higher but still minimal and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports consistently find no malicious code or suspicious activity. The code only performs imports and defines an export list.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code detected in any report.\n- **Risk scores:** All are at or near zero, reflecting low or no risk. The only slight deviation is in report 5, with a securityRisk of 0.1, which is reasonable given the optional import pattern, but no actual vulnerability or malicious activity is indicated.\n\n### Final Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should be **0** across the board, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0**, as no obfuscation is detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the lack of any actual security concern, the overall risk score should be **0** or very close to it. The minimal securityRisk of 0.1 in report 5 is acceptable but could be standardized to 0 for consistency.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The handling of optional dependencies with try-except is standard practice.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack, malicious code, or data exfiltration.\n- The code is typical for a Python package's interface setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | 0               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0               |\n| Security Risk      | 0               |\n\nThis reflects a benign, well-structured module with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign module setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The existing scores are reasonable, but for consistency and clarity, I recommend setting the malware and obfuscated scores explicitly to 0, and the overall security risk to 0.",
