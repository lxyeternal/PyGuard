  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward module setup with import handling, no external data, network, or malicious behavior. The confidence is high (1), and no malware or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed reasoning confirming benign intent. The code handles optional dependencies properly. No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is standard for module initialization, with proper handling of missing dependencies. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard module interface setup, no malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others; standard import pattern, no malicious behavior, minimal security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1 — slightly higher security risk score, but the reasoning indicates it's a benign, typical import setup.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Justification:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected. All reports agree on benign intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero in all reports, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly above zero in the last report (0.1), but justified as a minimal, standard import pattern with no actual security concern.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk; the 0.1 in one report is marginal and justifiable)\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a benign, standard module setup for a GPU-accelerated particle library, handling optional dependencies gracefully, with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores should reflect this assessment, with zero for malware and obfuscation, and a risk score of zero.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
