  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report finds no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and considers the code benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, handling optional dependencies with a try-except, and only performing imports and defining `__all__`. No external communication, data processing, or malicious logic detected.\n- **Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard import patterns, no suspicious activity, and proper handling of missing dependencies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, noting the use of try-except for optional import, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification:** Slightly less than perfect confidence but still no indication of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard import setup with safe error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also consistent, but notes a minimal securityRisk score of 0.1, citing the import error handling as \"harmless.\"\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** The securityRisk score is slightly elevated, but given the code's simplicity, this seems overstated. The try-except block is a common pattern, not a vulnerability.\n- **Verdict:** The securityRisk score could be lowered to 0, as no actual risk is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on zero, which is correct. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All zero, appropriate given the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly zero, with one report suggesting 0.1 due to the try-except pattern. Since the try-except is a standard dependency handling pattern and no other security issues are present, this should be 0.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- The code is a typical, benign module setup for a visualization or graphics library.\n- No signs of supply chain attack, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n- The minimal \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified; it should be 0.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (not 0.1, as no actual security risk exists)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward, safe module with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are consistent, and the scores should reflect the benign nature of the code.",
