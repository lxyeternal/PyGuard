  "purpose": "TCP server for remote JSON command control of a ParticleField object, allowing method invocation and event broadcasting.",
  "sources": "Receives JSON commands over network, reads 'command' and 'args' from client input.",
  "sinks": "Invokes methods on ParticleField via getattr, broadcasts events to clients via socket.sendall.",
  "flows": "Client input -> JSON parsing -> hasattr/getattr -> method call -> event broadcast to clients.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic method invocation without validation of 'args' or method safety; broad exception handling; no authentication.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard TCP server handling JSON commands with threading. It uses hasattr and getattr to invoke methods, which is common but could be risky if ParticleField exposes insecure methods. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are present. Exception handling is broad but benign. The primary security concern is lack of authentication and validation, which could be exploited in untrusted environments. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign remote control server with no malware or obfuscation. The main security risk stems from missing authentication and input validation, which could be exploited if the server is exposed to untrusted clients. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.3) is justified due to deployment considerations.",
