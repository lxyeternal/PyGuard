  "conclusion": "The code is a benign remote control server with no malware or obfuscation. The main security risk stems from missing authentication and input validation, which could be exploited if the server is exposed to untrusted clients. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.3) is justified due to deployment considerations."
