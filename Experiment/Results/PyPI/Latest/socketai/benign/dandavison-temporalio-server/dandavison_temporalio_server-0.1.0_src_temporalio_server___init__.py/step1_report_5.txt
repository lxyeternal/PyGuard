{
  "purpose": "This code manages a Temporal server process, including locating the server binary, starting/stopping the server, and monitoring its readiness, primarily for development or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads include system platform info, resource files for the binary, and process output streams (stdout/stderr). Input data such as configuration parameters are provided via function arguments and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are subprocess execution with dynamic arguments, network connections to specified IP and port, and process termination commands.",
  "flows": "Flow involves locating the binary (source), executing it with command-line arguments (sink), establishing network connections to verify server readiness (sink), and managing subprocess lifecycle (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code dynamically locates binaries and manages processes without executing untrusted code or evaluating untrusted input. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code securely locates a packaged binary, manages subprocesses asynchronously, and verifies server readiness through network checks. It uses standard Python modules and practices for process control and resource management. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious data flows are observed. The process termination logic and error handling are conventional. The use of environment info and process control appears intended solely for local development/testing purposes, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing a Temporal server process in a development environment. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows are evident. The overall security risk is minimal, with no signs of malicious intent.",
