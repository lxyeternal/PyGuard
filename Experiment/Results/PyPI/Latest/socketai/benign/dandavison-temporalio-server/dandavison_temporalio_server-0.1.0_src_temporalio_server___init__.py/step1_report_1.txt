{
  "purpose": "The code manages the lifecycle of a Temporal development server, including locating the server binary, starting the server as a subprocess, monitoring its readiness, and shutting it down.",
  "sources": "Binary path retrieval via 'resources.files' and 'resources.as_file'; subprocess creation with asyncio.create_subprocess_exec; reading stderr streams asynchronously; network connection checks for server readiness.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution and termination; network socket connection attempts to check server readiness; logging outputs; process termination signals.",
  "flows": "Code locates binary -> constructs command-line arguments -> starts server subprocess -> monitors stderr and port -> terminates process on exit.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code or misleading variable names; network connection checks are standard for readiness; no dynamic code execution or input/output flows indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a legitimate server management utility for starting and stopping a Temporal server instance. It carefully handles subprocess creation, monitors server readiness through network connection attempts and stderr reading, and ensures proper termination with signals. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors. All network and process operations are standard and contextually justified for server lifecycle management.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate server management utility without any detected malicious behavior. It handles process control and readiness checks securely and transparently. There are no signs of malicious sabotage or security risks within this module.",
