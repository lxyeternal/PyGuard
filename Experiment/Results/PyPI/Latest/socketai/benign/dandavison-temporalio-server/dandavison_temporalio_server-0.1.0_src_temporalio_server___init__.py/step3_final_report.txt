{
  "purpose": "The code manages locating the Temporal server binary, starting and monitoring the server process asynchronously, checking server readiness via network connection and stderr output, and gracefully terminating the process when done.",
  "sources": "Reads include package resource files for binary location, process stderr stream for logs, and network connection attempts to check server readiness.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are subprocess creation for server startup, network connection attempts for readiness checks, and process termination signals.",
  "flows": "Source: binary path retrieval and stderr reading; Sink: subprocess execution and network connection; Flow: binary path → subprocess start → stderr monitoring and port checking → process termination.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. The code uses standard libraries and practices for process management.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard server process management: locating binaries within package resources, launching the server asynchronously, monitoring stderr for logs, checking port connectivity for readiness, and terminating processes gracefully or forcefully if needed. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The process control and resource access are typical for such utilities, with appropriate error handling and timeouts. The network checks and stderr monitoring are standard for ensuring server readiness. Overall, the code is a legitimate, transparent server lifecycle manager with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured server management utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores in the reports are justified; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the low security risk reflects standard process and network operations.",
