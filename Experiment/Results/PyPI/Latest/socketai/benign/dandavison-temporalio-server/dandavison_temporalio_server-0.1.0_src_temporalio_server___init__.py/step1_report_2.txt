{
  "purpose": "This code manages the lifecycle of a Temporal development server process, including starting, monitoring, and terminating the server, with functions to locate the server binary and configure server parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading binary files from package resources, accessing process stdout/stderr streams, network socket connections for port readiness checks, and environment variables indirectly via system calls.",
  "sinks": "Process creation via asyncio.create_subprocess_exec, network connections to specified IP and port, process termination signals, and log outputs.",
  "flows": "The code locates the binary path, constructs command-line arguments, starts the server process, waits for server readiness via network connection, reads stderr asynchronously, and terminates the process upon exit or error.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. The code's only potentially sensitive operation is the dynamic process and network handling, which is typical for server management scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script safely manages subprocesses for a server, with proper error handling, logging, and asynchronous waiting mechanisms. It dynamically locates the server binary within package resources, constructs argument lists based on configuration, and waits for server readiness by attempting network connections to a specified port. It gracefully terminates the server process with SIGTERM and SIGKILL signals if needed. No suspicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious activities such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system damage are present. The network connection checks and process management are standard practices in server lifecycle scripts, with no indications of malicious intent or malware. The code adheres to best practices for process control and does not perform any malicious actions itself.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard server process manager with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It performs expected operations related to starting, monitoring, and stopping a Temporal server process, with robust error handling and logging. No malware or suspicious anomalies are detected.",
