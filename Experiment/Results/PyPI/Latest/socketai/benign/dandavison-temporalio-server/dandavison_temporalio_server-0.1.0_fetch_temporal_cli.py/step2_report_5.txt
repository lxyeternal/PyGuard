  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the technical details, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Purpose: Download and package the Temporal CLI binary during a build process.\n- Method: Uses platform info to construct download URLs, fetches precompiled binaries from GitHub, extracts them, and sets permissions.\n- Behavior: Standard download, extraction, cleanup, and permission setting operations.\n- No user input, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets.\n- No signs of malicious activity or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Code Validity:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code appears functional, with correct platform detection, URL construction, download, extraction, and cleanup. No evident bugs or security flaws.\n- **Malicious code or backdoors:** None detected. The code only performs download and file operations typical for build scripts.\n- **Content validation:** The code does not verify checksum or signatures, which could be a concern but is common in build scripts. The lack of validation is noted but not malicious.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The dynamic URL construction based on platform info is standard. No user input or untrusted data sources beyond the download URL, which is fixed per release version.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report's scores:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Malware:** 0 — Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Correct.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — Slightly elevated but justified as a build script with external dependencies.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — Appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly states the absence of malicious behavior, highlights lack of content validation, and notes the potential improvement.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Malware:** 0 — Correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Correct.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — Appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — Correct.\n- **Comments:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes legitimate purpose, no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Malware:** 0 — Correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Correct.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — Appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — Appropriate.\n- **Comments:** Accurate assessment; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Malware:** 0 — Correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Correct.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — Justified, as it is a build utility with external downloads.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — Appropriate.\n- **Comments:** Properly identifies the legitimate purpose and lack of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Malware:** 0 — Correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Correct.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — Slightly lower, justified as it’s a straightforward build script.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — Appropriate.\n- **Comments:** Correctly assesses the behavior as legitimate with low risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All around 0.1–0.2, justified given the nature of the script.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9), appropriate for the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert judgment:\n- The code is a typical build utility for downloading platform-specific binaries.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- The only potential concern is the lack of checksum validation, but this is common in such scripts and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with current scores)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, legitimate, and aligns with its purpose. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
