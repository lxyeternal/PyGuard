  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build utility for downloading platform-specific binaries. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The only potential improvement is adding checksum validation to enhance security, but current implementation is standard. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
