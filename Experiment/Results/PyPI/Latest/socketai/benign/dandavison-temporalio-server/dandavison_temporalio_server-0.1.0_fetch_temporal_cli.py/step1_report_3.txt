{
  "purpose": "The code is designed as a build hook for the Hatch packaging tool to download, extract, and prepare the Temporal CLI binary for inclusion in a Python package distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads build configuration variables (target_name, root), and downloads files from a GitHub URL constructed based on platform and architecture info.",
  "sinks": "The code writes the downloaded binary to a specific directory, modifies file permissions to make it executable, and potentially reads system platform information.",
  "flows": "Sources include platform info and build config variables; flows lead to constructing a download URL, downloading and extracting the binary, and setting permissions before saving the binary to the target directory.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically constructs download URLs based on platform and architecture without validation; it uses standard libraries in a way that could be misused if manipulated, but no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code includes a test mode that downloads from the internet, but it is intended for build processes, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script performs platform detection, constructs URLs for downloading CLI binaries, and extracts these binaries to a specified directory. It uses common libraries like urllib, zipfile, tarfile, and shutil, with no obfuscated or malicious code present. It does not include any network exfiltration, credential theft, or backdoors. The only notable aspect is dynamic URL construction for downloading third-party binaries, which is a common practice in build scripts. The code has no hidden or malicious behavior; it appears to be a legitimate build utility for packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build hook script that downloads and prepares a CLI binary based on platform info. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or malicious behavior. It performs expected operations for a build process without suspicious activity.",
