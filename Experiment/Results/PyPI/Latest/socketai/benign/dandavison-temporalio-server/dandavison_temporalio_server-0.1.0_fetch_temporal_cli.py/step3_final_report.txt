{
  "purpose": "Download and package the Temporal CLI binary during the build process, selecting platform-specific assets from GitHub releases.",
  "sources": "Platform detection via platform.system() and platform.machine(), URL construction based on platform info, download via urllib.request, reading response data, and extracting archives.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded archive to disk, extracting binary files, setting executable permissions, and cleanup of temporary files.",
  "flows": "Platform info determines URL; URL leads to download; download saves archive; archive is extracted to target directory; binary permissions are set.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors; straightforward download and extraction logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs platform detection, constructs download URLs dynamically, downloads precompiled binaries from GitHub, extracts them, and sets permissions. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The absence of checksum validation is noted but common in such scripts. The code is clear, well-structured, and performs expected operations without security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build utility for downloading platform-specific binaries. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The only potential improvement is adding checksum validation to enhance security, but current implementation is standard. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
