  "purpose": "A custom build hook for Hatch that downloads and packages the Temporal CLI binary during the build process.",
  "sources": "Downloads from GitHub releases URL based on platform detection; reads environment and system info for platform mapping.",
  "sinks": "Writes binary files to the target directory; deletes temporary archive files after extraction.",
  "flows": "Downloads URL constructed from platform info → downloaded archive saved locally → binary extracted to target directory → cleanup of archive.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Uses platform info to dynamically determine URLs; downloads and executes external binaries but does so in a controlled build context. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors detected. The download process is straightforward and limited to specified release assets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a build hook that dynamically constructs download URLs based on platform info and fetches the Temporal CLI binary. It carefully handles different archive formats (.tar.gz and .zip), extracts the relevant binary, and sets execute permissions on non-Windows systems. No code injection, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors are present. The download is limited to a specific GitHub release asset, and the process is typical for such build steps. The temporary download file is cleaned up after extraction, reducing risk. Overall, the code performs a legitimate build operation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build hook that downloads a known, versioned CLI binary based on platform detection. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident. It responsibly manages downloads and file permissions within a build process. The overall security risk is low, with no signs of malware or malicious anomalies.",
