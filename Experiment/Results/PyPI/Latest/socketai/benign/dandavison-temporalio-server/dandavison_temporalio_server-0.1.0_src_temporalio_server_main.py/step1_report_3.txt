{
  "purpose": "This script runs an external binary (likely the temporalio-server) with command-line arguments passed through, managing its execution and handling termination signals.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments (sys.argv[1:]) and retrieves a binary path via get_binary_path()",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes the external binary with provided arguments; potential for command injection if args are not sanitized, but here they are constructed from trusted sources and function calls",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1:] (user input) -> args list -> subprocess.Popen -> process.wait() -> process.kill() (on KeyboardInterrupt)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious domains, or malicious code patterns detected. The code cleanly manages process termination. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and uses a helper to determine the binary path. It constructs command-line arguments securely and passes them to subprocess.Popen, which is a common and safe practice when handling external processes. Signal handling for KeyboardInterrupt ensures clean shutdown without indefinite hanging. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The process management appears standard and safe, with no evidence of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a safe wrapper to execute an external binary, handling termination signals properly. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are evident based on this code segment.",
