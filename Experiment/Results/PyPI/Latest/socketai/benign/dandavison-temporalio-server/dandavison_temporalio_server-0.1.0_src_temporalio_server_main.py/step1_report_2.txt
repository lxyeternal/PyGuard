{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to locate a binary executable related to the temporalio-server, and run it with specific arguments, handling process termination and signals appropriately.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv; retrieves binary path via get_binary_path()",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.Popen() to execute an external binary; captures exit code and terminates process based on signals",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1:] (source) -> args list (constructed) -> subprocess.Popen(args) (sink); process.wait() (sink) -> exit code (sink); KeyboardInterrupt (source) -> process.kill() (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; subprocess is used securely with provided arguments; error handling is standard; no unusual code structures",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically locates an executable binary using get_binary_path(), then runs it with command-line parameters. It captures and manages signals like KeyboardInterrupt, killing the process if interrupted, which is standard process control. No embedded malicious code, suspicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code structure and flow are typical for process management scripts. No obfuscated or intentionally malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a controlled wrapper around an external binary, handling process execution and interruption safely. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware within this module. It appears to be a legitimate process management script with standard security practices.",
