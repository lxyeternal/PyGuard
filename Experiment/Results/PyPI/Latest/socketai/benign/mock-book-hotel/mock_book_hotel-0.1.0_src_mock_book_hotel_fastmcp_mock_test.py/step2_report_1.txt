  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a straightforward mock hotel booking tool built with FastMCP.\n- They note that the code imports standard modules, defines a tool function that returns a formatted string based on user inputs, and runs a server with SSE transport.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or malicious behaviors are observed.\n- Default parameter 'num1=12345' is benign and likely for testing.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, and security risk is also 0.\n- Confidence is high (1), and obfuscated/malware/securityRisk scores are consistently low.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are evident in the code.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Scores:** The assigned scores seem reasonable; no need to adjust them.\n- **Malware justification:** Scores of 0 are justified; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** No unwarranted assumptions; the analysis is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The code is a mock implementation, with no real data handling or external interactions.\n- Default values and structure are standard; no suspicious patterns.\n- The server runs with SSE, which is typical for such tools.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, straightforward, and free of security issues.**\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the existing scores. The code poses no security threat, and the reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current evaluations and the code's nature.",
