{
  "purpose": "The code defines a mock hotel reservation tool using FastMCP framework for asynchronous operation and type validation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the function parameters: guest_name, room_type, guests, num1, str1.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any explicit sinks such as network requests, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the return string to generate a response message; no data is transmitted elsewhere or processed insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The default values are benign. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a tool function for booking hotel rooms, with input validation via Pydantic fields. It runs a server with SSE transport method. There are no network communications, data leaks, or malicious operations. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be straightforward and intended for mock operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign mock implementation for hotel booking with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
