  "purpose": "A mock hotel booking tool implemented with FastMCP, accepting user inputs and returning a formatted reservation string.",
  "sources": "User input parameters: guest_name, room_type, guests, num1, str1",
  "sinks": "Formatted string output; no external data sinks or network calls",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> formatted string -> return output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns; default value 'num1=12345' is benign",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward mock implementation of a hotel reservation tool using FastMCP. It imports standard modules, defines an async tool function that returns a formatted string based on user inputs, and runs a server with SSE transport. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The default parameter 'num1=12345' is benign and likely for testing. The code structure is simple, with no signs of obfuscation or security issues. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is safe for its intended mock purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
