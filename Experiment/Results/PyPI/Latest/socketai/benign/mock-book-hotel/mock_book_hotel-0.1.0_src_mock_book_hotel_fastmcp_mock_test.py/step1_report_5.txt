{
  "purpose": "Define a mock hotel booking tool using FastMCP for handling guest reservations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the 'book_hotel' function: guest_name, room_type, guests, num1, str1.",
  "sinks": "Return statement that formats a response string, no external data or sensitive sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate a formatted string; no data flows to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "Default values in parameters (e.g., num1=12345) are benign; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present. The code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a FastMCP instance, and a tool function for booking hotel rooms with input validation via Pydantic. The function constructs and returns a formatted string based on input parameters, which are all benign. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious behavior. The 'run' function simply starts the server with SSE transport. Overall, the code is simple, clear, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign mock implementation of a hotel booking tool with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply processes input parameters and returns a formatted message without external data leaks or harmful operations.",
