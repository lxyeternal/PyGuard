{
  "purpose": "Defines a mock hotel booking tool using FastMCP, allowing asynchronous booking requests with specific parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from the 'book_hotel' function: guest_name, room_type, guests, num1, str1.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a formatted string; no external data sinks or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are received and directly used in string formatting without external data flow or injection points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code are detected. The default values are benign. No external calls or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a straightforward asynchronous tool for hotel booking, with input validation via Pydantic. No dynamic code execution, no external data access, and no suspicious patterns. The function is a mock and does not perform real actions. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign mock implementation for a hotel booking tool with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
