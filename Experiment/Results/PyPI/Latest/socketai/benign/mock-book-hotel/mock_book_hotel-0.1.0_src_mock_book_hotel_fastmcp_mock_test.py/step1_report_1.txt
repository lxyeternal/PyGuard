{
  "purpose": "Defines a mock hotel booking tool for asynchronous use via FastMCP server",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, pydantic, and mcp.server.fastmcp; the function parameters; the instantiation of FastMCP",
  "sinks": "The async function 'book_hotel' returns a formatted string based on input parameters; no external data sinks or network calls are present",
  "flows": "User input parameters (guest_name, room_type, guests, num1, str1) flow into the 'book_hotel' function and are used to generate a response string",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; default values are set for parameters; no code injection, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic observed",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a FastMCP server with a single tool 'book_hotel' that constructs a response string based on user input. No external data sources, network communications, or security-sensitive operations are present. The default parameter 'num1' with value 12345 is benign. The use of the pydantic Field class for descriptions and defaults is standard. The code appears to be a straightforward mock implementation without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mock implementation of a hotel booking tool with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
