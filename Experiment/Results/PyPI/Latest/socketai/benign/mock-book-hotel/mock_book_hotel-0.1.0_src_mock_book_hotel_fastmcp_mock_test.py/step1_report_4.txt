{
  "purpose": "The code defines a mock hotel booking tool that allows users to reserve rooms with specific parameters such as guest name and room type.",
  "sources": "Code reads user input parameters: guest_name, room_type, guests, num1, str1.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data output beyond returning a string message; no external network or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "User inputs (guest_name, room_type, guests, num1, str1) flow into the 'book_hotel' function, which processes and returns a confirmation message.",
  "anomalies": "The parameter 'num1' has a default value of 12345, possibly for testing; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, sets up a FastMCP instance, and defines a tool 'book_hotel' for hotel reservations. The function accepts various parameters and returns a formatted string. No external network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration observed. The default value for 'num1' appears to be a test parameter, not malicious. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple mock hotel booking utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs straightforward data handling and user input processing without any malicious behavior.",
