{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes a function named 'run' from a local module 'fastmcp_mock_test'. Its purpose appears to be to execute that function when 'main' is called.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .fastmcp_mock_test import run' - reads the 'run' function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'run()' in the 'main' function - executes the imported function which may perform actions based on its implementation.",
  "flows": "The 'main' function calls 'run()', establishing a direct source-to-sink flow when 'main()' is invoked.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. It depends entirely on the implementation of 'run' in 'fastmcp_mock_test'. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident from this fragment alone.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a local module and calls it within 'main'. There are no direct indicators of malicious activity such as network calls, data leaks, or backdoors. The behavior entirely depends on the implementation of 'run'. Given the limited context, there is no evidence of malicious intent in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward trigger for the 'run' function from a local module. No malicious or suspicious behavior can be determined solely from this fragment. The security risk is low, assuming the 'run' function does not perform malicious actions.",
