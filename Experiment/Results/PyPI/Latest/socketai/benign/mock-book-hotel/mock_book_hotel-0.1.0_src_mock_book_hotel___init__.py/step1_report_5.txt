{
  "purpose": "This code imports a function named 'run' from a local module 'fastmcp_mock_test' and executes it within the main() function.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module; call to the 'run()' function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'run()' which could potentially be a sink depending on its implementation, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions are visible.",
  "flows": "Main function calls 'run()' from the imported module; no untrusted data input or output identified in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The module 'fastmcp_mock_test' is unspecified, so its behavior is unknown.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, involving only an import and a function call. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. However, because the behavior of 'run' is unknown, potential risks depend on the implementation of 'fastmcp_mock_test'. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious intents are apparent from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, simply executing a function from a local module. No direct security risks are evident, but full assessment depends on the implementation of 'run' in 'fastmcp_mock_test'.",
