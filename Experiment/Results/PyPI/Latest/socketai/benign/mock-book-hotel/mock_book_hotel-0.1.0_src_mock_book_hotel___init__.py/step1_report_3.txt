{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'run' from a module called 'fastmcp_mock_test' and executes it within the main() function. Its purpose appears to be to execute a predefined test or process when run.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'run' function from the local package/module 'fastmcp_mock_test'.",
  "sinks": "The 'run' function call is a sink; if 'run' executes untrusted or malicious code, it could lead to malicious activity. No other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The source (imported 'run') flows directly into its invocation in main(), which is executed if the script runs, leading to potential execution of any code within 'run'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are evident in the code structure. The code is straightforward, with minimal complexity and no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function 'run' from a local module and executes it inside main(). There are no visible indicators of obfuscation, malicious intent, or suspicious data handling. The security risk heavily depends on the implementation of 'run', which is not provided. The code appears to be a simple script runner, common in test setups or entry points.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code, there are no explicit signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment. The overall security posture depends on the implementation of 'run' in 'fastmcp_mock_test'. The code itself is benign and standard for executing a test or process.",
