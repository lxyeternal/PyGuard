{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'run' from a local module 'fastmcp_mock_test' and executes it in the main function.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'run' from a local module; execution of 'run()' in main.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'run()' potentially leads to code within 'fastmcp_mock_test' being executed, which could contain malicious code.",
  "flows": "The source of data (imported function) flows into its execution via 'run()'.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; the code is straightforward. The only point of concern is the imported module, which is not shown here.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a local module 'fastmcp_mock_test' and calls its 'run()' function when executed. Since the behavior of 'run()' depends on the implementation within 'fastmcp_mock_test', without inspecting that module, we cannot definitively assess its safety. The code structure is simple and standard for Python scripts. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident. The security assessment hinges on the content of 'fastmcp_mock_test'.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears benign, serving as a launcher for a function in a local module. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'run()' in 'fastmcp_mock_test'. No malicious behavior is detectable from this snippet alone.",
