  "purpose": "Minimal script that imports and executes the 'run' function from a local module 'fastmcp_mock_test'.",

  "sinks": "Execution of 'run()' which may execute arbitrary code depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Import 'run' -> call 'run()' within 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward import and call pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for a script that triggers a function. The behavior depends entirely on the implementation of 'run()' within 'fastmcp_mock_test'. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The security implications hinge on 'run()'; without inspecting it, the code appears benign. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk based solely on this snippet. The confidence in benignity is high unless 'run()' contains malicious code, which cannot be determined here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple entry point that calls a function from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal assuming 'run()' is safe. Scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2). The main uncertainty depends on the implementation of 'run()'.",
