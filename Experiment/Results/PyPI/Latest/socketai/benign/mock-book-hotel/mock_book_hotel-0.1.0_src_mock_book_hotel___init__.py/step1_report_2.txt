{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'run' from a local module 'fastmcp_mock_test' and executes it in the main function.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.fastmcp_mock_test' module, and invocation of 'run()' in main()",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'run()' could potentially lead to untrusted code execution if 'run' contains malicious code",
  "flows": "The local import 'run' is called directly in main(), which executes whatever code is inside 'run'",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module and executes it within the main function. Without the contents of 'fastmcp_mock_test', it's impossible to determine if 'run()' contains malicious behavior. The structure itself is standard and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious patterns. No external inputs, network calls, or credential handling are visible here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple entry point that calls a function from a local module. Based solely on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The potential risk depends entirely on the implementation of 'run()' in 'fastmcp_mock_test'.",
