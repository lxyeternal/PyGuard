  "purpose": "Define regex patterns for cleavage site rules in protein sequences.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a static dictionary definition with regex patterns.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input or data manipulation is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed; static data definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward dictionary assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a dictionary 'cleavage_rules' mapping various enzyme names to regex patterns that likely match cleavage sites in protein sequences. The patterns use standard regex syntax, lookaheads, lookbehinds, and character classes to specify amino acid sequences. There are no functions, no dynamic code execution, no data input handling, and no network operations. The regex patterns appear to be domain-specific for bioinformatics purposes, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious code segments. The code is static and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static dictionary defining regex patterns for cleavage site recognition, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, domain-specific dataset for bioinformatics analysis.",
