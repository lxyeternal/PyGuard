{
  "purpose": "The code defines a dictionary of regular expression patterns for cleavage rules used in protein analysis, mapping enzyme names to their specific cleavage site patterns.",
  "sources": "The data source is the static dictionary 'cleavage_rules' defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data flows or can cause data leaks or effects; the code does not process external input.",
  "flows": "The code does not implement any runtime data flows or input processing; it solely defines static regex patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be straightforward static definitions of regex patterns. No obfuscated code, hidden imports, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a static dictionary assigning enzyme names to regex patterns indicating cleavage sites. These patterns are hardcoded strings, used likely for bioinformatics purposes. The patterns include lookahead and lookbehind assertions, and do not process external inputs or execute code dynamically. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network access, or data exfiltration. All elements are static and intended for pattern matching within a larger application context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static dictionary of regex patterns for cleavage site recognition, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard component of a bioinformatics toolkit, with no suspicious behaviors or hidden functionalities.",
