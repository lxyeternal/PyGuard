{
  "purpose": "This code defines a static dictionary of regex patterns used for identifying cleavage sites in protein sequences, serving as a configuration or data repository for bioinformatics analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded regex pattern strings within the dictionary entries.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows. It only provides static pattern definitions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is purely declarative with static regex patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code contains straightforward regex patterns with domain-specific biochemical sequences. No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static dictionary mapping enzyme names to regex patterns for cleavage sites. It uses standard regex syntax, including lookahead and lookbehind assertions, with no dynamic code execution or external data input. The patterns are domain-specific and appear safe. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is to serve as a configuration for bioinformatics sequence analysis, and it does not perform any operations or data processing at runtime.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, domain-specific configuration dictionary for regex patterns used in protein cleavage site recognition. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are accurate and justified.",
