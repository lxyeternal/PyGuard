  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a static dictionary mapping enzyme names to regex patterns for cleavage sites.\n- No external input, data flow, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- Regex patterns use standard syntax, including lookahead/lookbehind assertions, with domain-specific biochemical sequences.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious code features are detected.\n- The code appears to be a configuration or data repository for bioinformatics purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious behavior.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct; minimal risk, no malware.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All are zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are very low or zero, consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \nGiven the content, scores are reasonable and justified. The code is purely declarative, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected or implied).\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation).\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk).\n\n**Additional note:**  \nEven if a hypothetical attacker attempted to embed malicious regex patterns, the current patterns are domain-specific and appear safe. The code's static nature and lack of dynamic features further reduce risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately scored. No changes are necessary. The code is a benign, domain-specific configuration of regex patterns for protein cleavage site recognition.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe and non-malicious.",
