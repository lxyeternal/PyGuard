  "purpose": "Definition of regular expressions for cleavage site rules in protein sequences.",
  "sources": "The dictionary itself, which contains string patterns used for matching sequences; no external input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data output, network communication, or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code solely defines static regex patterns without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists of straightforward regex pattern definitions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary with key-value pairs where keys are protein cleavage names, and values are regex patterns for matching cleavage sites. The patterns use standard regex syntax with lookahead and lookbehind assertions. No dynamic code execution, external data reading, or obfuscated constructs are present. The patterns appear to be domain-specific for proteomics, with no signs of malicious intent. The code is static and purely declarative, serving as a configuration or pattern repository.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static dictionary of regex patterns related to protein cleavage rules, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate configuration module for bioinformatics processing.",
