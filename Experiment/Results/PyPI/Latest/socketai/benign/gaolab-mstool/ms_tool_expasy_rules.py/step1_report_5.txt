{
  "purpose": "Define a dictionary of regex patterns for cleavage rules in biochemical analysis.",
  "sources": "The dictionary itself serves as a static data structure; no external data input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; the code does not perform data leakage or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with regex pattern definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected. The code appears to be a straightforward dictionary of regex patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python dictionary defining regex patterns for various biochemical cleavage rules. No dynamic execution, no external data inputs, no functions, no network operations, and no obfuscated code. Patterns seem to follow standard regex syntax used in biological sequence analysis. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The patterns are well-formed regex strings intended for pattern matching in sequences. There are no indications of hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static dictionary defining regex patterns for biochemical cleavage rules. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. It is a typical configuration or data structure for biological sequence processing.",
