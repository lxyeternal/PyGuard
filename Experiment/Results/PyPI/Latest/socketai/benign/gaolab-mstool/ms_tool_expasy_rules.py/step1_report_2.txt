{
  "purpose": "Define a set of regex patterns for cleavage rules associated with various enzymes and chemical agents, likely used for protein sequence analysis.",
  "sources": "The code itself is a static dictionary declaration; no input reading or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leak points; the regex patterns are stored as string values within the dictionary.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow, input, or output processes; static data definition only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden network activity. The regex patterns are straightforward and correspond to biochemical cleavage sites.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static dictionary assignment mapping enzyme or reagent names to regex patterns that identify cleavage sites in protein sequences. The patterns include positive lookahead and lookbehind assertions, which are common in pattern matching for sequence motifs. There are no functions, input/output operations, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The patterns appear to be scientifically grounded rather than malicious. No evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent is found.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a data structure for biochemical sequence analysis and does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It is a benign, static configuration mapping enzyme names to regex patterns. The overall security risk is minimal.",
