  "purpose": "To read and verify the Adler-32 checksum of Thermo RAW files, ensuring data integrity.",
  "sources": "File reading operations (open, read, getsize) on user-specified filename.",
  "sinks": "Checksum comparison and output, no data leaks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Reading file header and data -> calculating checksum -> comparing checksum -> returning result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior; checksum calculation appears standard. No obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a specified file, extracts a header, and computes an Adler-32 checksum for validation against an embedded checksum in the file header. It performs a straightforward integrity check without external network communication, system modifications, or malicious payloads. The code uses standard libraries and functions, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. Overall, the logic is consistent with a normal file validation process.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard checksum validation for Thermo RAW files, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It reads specific parts of the file, computes a checksum, and compares it against an embedded value to verify integrity. The code appears legitimate and safe.",
