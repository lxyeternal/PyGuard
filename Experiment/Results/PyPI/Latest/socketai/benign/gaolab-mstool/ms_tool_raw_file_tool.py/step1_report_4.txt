  "purpose": "To verify the integrity of Thermo RAW files by computing and comparing Adler-32 checksums.",
  "sources": "File reads (open and read), os.path.getsize for filesize",
  "sinks": "Comparison of checksum values for validation, output via print (not a security sink but a user-facing output)",
  "flows": "Read file -> extract header -> compute checksum -> compare with stored checksum -> output result",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The checksum calculation and header modification appear standard for integrity verification. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs. The file path is hardcoded in test but not in production code.",
  "analysis": "The code reads binary files, extracts headers, modifies certain bytes, and computes Adler-32 checksums. It compares computed checksum with a stored checksum in the file header to verify integrity. The checksum calculation uses standard zlib.adler32 and struct packing/unpacking. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns. No network activity, system commands, or data exfiltration is present. The only potential concern is the hardcoded file path in the test, but this is typical for testing purposes and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard checksum verification on files, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate integrity check utility for specific file types, with no malicious payload or backdoors.",
