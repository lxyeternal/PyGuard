  "purpose": "Dependency validation and module imports for mass spectrometry data processing tools.",
  "sources": "Reading dependency list (_hard_dependencies), attempting to import each dependency, importing modules/functions from ms_tool package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Dependency list -> import attempts -> successful import of modules/functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward dependency check and module import pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of required dependencies and attempts to import each, raising ImportError if any are missing. It then deletes temporary variables, imports specific modules and functions from ms_tool, and sets descriptive documentation and __all__ for API exposure. The code is a typical __init__.py setup script for a scientific package, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The dependency validation is standard practice, and the import statements are straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or untrusted data are involved. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very close) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script performing dependency checks and module imports. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores across reports are justified and accurate.",
