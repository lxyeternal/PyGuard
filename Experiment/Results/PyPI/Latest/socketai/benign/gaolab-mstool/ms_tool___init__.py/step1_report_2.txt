{
  "purpose": "The code loads specific dependencies, imports modules and functions related to mass spectrometry data processing, and provides package metadata and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements (__import__ for dependencies, from ms_tool for modules and functions), hardcoded dependency list.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No use of untrusted input, network operations, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code imports modules and functions without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. The dynamic import check is standard for dependency validation.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by verifying the presence of essential dependencies (numpy, lxml, pyarrow) via dynamic import with exception handling. It then imports specific modules and functions from an ms_tool package, defines a descriptive docstring, and sets __all__ for exports. The logic is straightforward, intended for package setup and documentation. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious operations such as network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup script for a mass spectrometry data processing package. It performs dependency checks and imports without any malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious behavior or malware indicators are present.",
