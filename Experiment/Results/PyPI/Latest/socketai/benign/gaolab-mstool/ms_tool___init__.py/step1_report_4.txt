{
  "purpose": "The code initializes dependencies, imports modules from 'ms_tool', and provides documentation for a mass spectrometry data processing package.",
  "sources": "The code reads hard dependencies ('numpy', 'lxml', 'pyarrow') for import, and imports various functions and classes from 'ms_tool' modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present. There are no network operations, system calls, or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "The dependencies are imported at the start; the rest of the code is primarily import statements and documentation. There are no data flows involving untrusted input or user data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code only performs imports and documentation setup.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by defining a list of required dependencies and attempts to import each, raising ImportError if any fail, which is standard dependency management. It then deletes temporary variables. It proceeds to import specific modules and functions from 'ms_tool', which appears to be a domain-specific package for mass spectrometry data processing. The package documentation string describes the package's purpose. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard dependency check and module import setup for a specialized scientific package. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. The code is well-structured and focused solely on importing modules and documenting the package.",
