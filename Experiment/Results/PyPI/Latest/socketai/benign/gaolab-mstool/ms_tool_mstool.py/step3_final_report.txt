  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code content, data sources, sinks, and potential anomalies.",
  "sources": "Imported modules (e.g., socket, subprocess, sys), environment variables, user inputs, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, subprocess executions, file modifications, environment variable access, eval/exec calls.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (e.g., network, environment) to sinks (e.g., subprocess, network transmission), potentially via eval/exec or hardcoded commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of network/system modules without context, potential eval/exec usage, lack of code or suspicious import patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation indicators.",
  "analysis": "Most reports lack concrete code, relying on module imports and high-level descriptions. While modules like socket and subprocess can be used benignly, their presence warrants caution. The absence of actual code limits definitive conclusions. The initial malware scores of zero are appropriate, but for Report 3, the potential misuse of modules suggests increasing the malware score slightly. Obfuscation is not indicated in any report. Risk scores are low, reflecting the lack of evidence but acknowledging potential misuse. Confidence levels are moderate to low due to missing code details. Overall, the assessments are reasonable, with a justified slight increase in malware risk for Report 3.",
  "conclusion": "The current evaluations are appropriate given the limited code context. For Report 3, a marginally higher malware score (around 0.4) better captures the potential risk posed by module usage. Other reports correctly assign zero or minimal risk scores. No further adjustments are necessary unless concrete code snippets reveal malicious activity.",
