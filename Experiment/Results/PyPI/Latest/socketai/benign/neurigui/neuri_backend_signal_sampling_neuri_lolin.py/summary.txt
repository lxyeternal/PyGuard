  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate neurodata acquisition utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The overall security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The code's behavior aligns with expected hardware interfacing functions, and the risk score of approximately 0.2 is justified."
