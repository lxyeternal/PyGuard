  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code primarily handles module imports and defines a configuration dictionary for various hardware boards.\n- The imports are wrapped in broad try-except blocks, which can hide import errors but are common in package management.\n- The 'COMPATIBLE_BOARDS' dictionary contains static configuration data, including class references imported at the top.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or data processing is evident.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard setup/configuration code for hardware interfacing.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues:\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior?** No.\n- **Obfuscation?** No.\n- **Use of dynamic code execution or external communication?** No.\n- **Hardcoded secrets or credentials?** No.\n- **Import handling with broad excepts?** Yes, but this is common and not malicious.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The broad except clause suppresses all exceptions, which can hide import errors. While this is a minor concern for debugging, it does not constitute a security flaw.\n- No actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent detected.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports give 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports give 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports give 0 or 0.2. Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0.2 is acceptable as a conservative estimate considering the broad exception handling.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign scores > 0.5; all are at or below 0.2.\n- Given the code's benign and configuration nature, a higher score is unwarranted.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the content.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as standard configuration code with no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (to account for broad exception handling but not malicious)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, benign configuration setup for hardware sampling utilities. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The broad exception handling is a minor concern but not a security threat.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- Consider narrowing exception handling to specific exceptions to improve debugging.\n- Overall, no changes needed regarding security assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| 0         | 0            | 0.2    |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
