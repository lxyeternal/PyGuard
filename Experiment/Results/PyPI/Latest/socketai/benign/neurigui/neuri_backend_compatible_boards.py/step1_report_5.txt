  "purpose": "Defines sampling utility classes and configuration for various neurostimulation boards.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sampling utility classes; dictionary 'COMPATIBLE_BOARDS' containing board configurations.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs; configuration data is static.",
  "flows": "Imports and class references used in 'COMPATIBLE_BOARDS' dictionary entries; no dynamic data flows or external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad except clause for import fallback may hide import errors; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code present; configuration appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from modules, with a fallback import using relative paths if the first fails, indicating compatibility handling. The 'COMPATIBLE_BOARDS' dictionary maps board names to their configurations, including sampling rates, baud rates, and class objects. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present. No network activity, system modification, or data leakage code detected. The import pattern and static configuration suggest legitimate setup code for hardware interfacing. No anomalies indicative of malicious intent or sabotage are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a configuration and import setup for hardware sampling utilities with fallback import logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The overall structure and content are consistent with legitimate hardware configuration code.",
