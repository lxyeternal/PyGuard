{
  "purpose": "This code manages imports of sampling utility classes and defines a configuration dictionary for various EEG/biosignal hardware boards, facilitating hardware compatibility and setup.",
  "sources": "The import statements for sampling utility classes; the dictionary entries within COMPATIBLE_BOARDS referencing these classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration data and class references are used without external data flow.",
  "flows": "Imports are assigned to class references in the dictionary; no dynamic or external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The broad try-except block suppresses all import errors, which can hide import issues but is a common pattern for optional imports; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports of specific classes, handling potential import errors with a broad exception clause. The COMPATIBLE_BOARDS dictionary contains configuration parameters and class references for hardware boards. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The broad exception handling could mask import errors but does not pose a security threat. The code is straightforward and configuration-oriented, with no external data processing or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup for hardware sampling utilities, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor concern is the broad exception clause, which could hide import errors but does not introduce security vulnerabilities.",
