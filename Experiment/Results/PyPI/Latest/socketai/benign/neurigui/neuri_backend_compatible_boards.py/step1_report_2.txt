  "purpose": "Manage different sampling utilities and their configurations for various EEG/biometric boards.",
  "sources": "Imports of sampling utility classes, dictionary definitions for board configurations.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Dictionary setup; no runtime data flow or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad except clause that suppresses all exceptions, potentially hiding import errors; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple sampling utility classes, handling the case where it is run as a package or standalone. It then defines a dictionary mapping board names to configuration lists, including parameters like sampling rate, baud rate, and class objects. The import fallback is broad, catching all exceptions without logging or handling, which can obscure issues but is not inherently malicious. The configuration data appears standard for hardware setup, with no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious network activity. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a configuration setup for different EEG/biometric boards, with benign import handling and structured configuration data. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this fragment. The only minor concern is the broad exception clause that could hide import errors but does not pose a security threat.",
