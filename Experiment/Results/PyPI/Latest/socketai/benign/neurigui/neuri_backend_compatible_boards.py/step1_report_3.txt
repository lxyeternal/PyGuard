  "purpose": "Define and manage sampling utilities for various EEG and biosignal boards, including import handling and configuration settings.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sampling utility classes, dictionary definitions for board configurations.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not process untrusted data or output data. It primarily sets up configuration.",
  "flows": "Imports (sources) to usage in the COMPATIBLE_BOARDS dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad except clause without specifying exception types, which can mask import errors or other issues; potential for dynamic import issues if modules are missing or renamed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import several modules containing sampling utility classes, with fallback relative imports if top-level imports fail. This is a common pattern for package compatibility. The dictionary COMPATIBLE_BOARDS defines configurations for different hardware boards, storing parameters and class references. No user input handling, network communication, or data processing occurs here. The broad except clause could hide import errors, which may be a concern, but does not constitute malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, configuration-oriented, with no suspicious patterns or malicious code observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration and import setup for hardware sampling utilities. No malicious activity or malware indicators are present. The broad exception could mask errors, but this is a common pattern in package imports. Overall, it appears benign.",
