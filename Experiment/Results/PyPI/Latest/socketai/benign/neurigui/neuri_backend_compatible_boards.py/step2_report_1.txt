  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as managing imports of sampling utility classes and defining a configuration dictionary (`COMPATIBLE_BOARDS`) for various EEG/biosignal hardware boards.\n- The code uses a try-except block to handle import errors, with broad exception handling (`except:`).\n- No report identifies any malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The primary concern raised is the broad exception clause which could hide import errors.\n- All reports agree that the code is configuration/setup-oriented, with no evidence of data leaks, network activity, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and straightforward. The class objects are imported and stored in the dictionary, which is standard practice.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** The only minor concern is the broad `except:` clause that can hide import errors, but this is a common pattern for optional or fallback imports, not malicious.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** Reports assign values between 0.2 and 0.3, citing the broad exception clause as a minor concern. This seems reasonable, but perhaps slightly conservative given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk score:\n\n- The broad `except:` can mask import errors, which might lead to misconfiguration or runtime failures, but it does not pose a direct security threat.\n- Since no malicious activity is present, the risk score should remain low, around 0.2-0.3.\n\n### Consistency and reasoning:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The malware score is correctly zero.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly zero.\n- The security risk is low but acknowledges the exception handling pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — minor concern due to broad exception handling, but overall benign.\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a standard configuration setup for hardware sampling utilities with no supply chain security issues.**",
