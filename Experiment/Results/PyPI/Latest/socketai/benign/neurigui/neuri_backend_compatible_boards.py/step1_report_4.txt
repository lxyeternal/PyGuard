{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of sampling utilities and configuration parameters for different types of EEG or biosignal boards, managing imports and storing configuration data in a dictionary.",
  "sources": "Imports of SamplingUtils classes from module files; access to COMPATIBLE_BOARDS dictionary for configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are evident; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Imports are assigned to dictionary entries; configuration data is stored in COMPATIBLE_BOARDS, which may be used elsewhere in the application.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception 'except:' for import fallback is a potential concern, but common in optional import scenarios; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code found.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import sampling utility classes from different modules, with a fallback import if the initial attempt fails. The dictionary COMPATIBLE_BOARDS stores configuration parameters for different hardware boards, including sampling rates, baud rates, and class references. No data is processed from external sources directly within this code; the import and data storage appear benign. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The broad except clause could hide import errors, but it is a common pattern for optional imports. The rest of the code consists of static data definitions and straightforward imports, with no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as configuration and import management for different biosignal boards. No malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are detected. The broad exception handling is a minor concern but not malicious. Overall, this code appears benign and intended for hardware configuration purposes.",
