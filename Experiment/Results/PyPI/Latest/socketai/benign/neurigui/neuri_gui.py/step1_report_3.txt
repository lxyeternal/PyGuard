{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs a GUI application for sampling, processing, and visualizing signal data, with support for headless operation and multiple processing components.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments (sys.argv), shared memory buffers, and external board-specific utils for sampling. Data flows from hardware via process_samples (sampling function) into shared memory.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include shared memory buffers, GUI display elements, and network sockets (pm.send_sock). Data is sent to GUI plots and possibly over network if configured.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardware sampling process (process_samples) into shared buffers; then, via GUI timers, data is read from shared memory and plotted or sent over network socket (pm.send_sock).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are evident. The code uses multiprocessing, shared memory, and external modules for signal processing and GUI handling. Exception handling is broad but normal. No obfuscated or encrypted code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a GUI application with multiprocessing for sampling signals, utilizing external modules for signal processing and hardware interface. Shared memory buffers facilitate data exchange between processes. The GUI dynamically updates plots or runs headless sampling based on configuration. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity is present. The code appears to be a legitimate application designed for real-time signal monitoring, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical signal processing GUI application with multiprocessing and shared memory. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It appears safe and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
