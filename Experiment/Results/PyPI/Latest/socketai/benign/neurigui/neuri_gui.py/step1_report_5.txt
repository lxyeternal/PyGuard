{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a GUI application for signal processing, visualization, and board-specific sampling in a user interface built with PyQt5, managing shared memory and subprocesses for real-time data acquisition.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from hardware via board-specific processing functions, environment variables for configuration (potentially via imported modules), and user interactions through GUI widgets.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if shared memory or network sockets are misused; updating GUI elements based on untrusted or uncontrolled data; process termination commands.",
  "flows": "Hardware data acquisition functions (process_samples) -> shared memory buffer (shared_buffer) -> GUI update functions (update_signal_plot) -> user interface interactions; also, processes communicate via shared memory and process control variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. Use of subprocesses and shared memory is standard for real-time data acquisition; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is detected. The code does not perform any network communication outside the data acquisition functions, nor does it include code that sends system data over the network or accesses sensitive info unsafely.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a PyQt5 GUI for signal processing, manages shared memory for real-time data, and launches subprocesses for hardware sampling. It handles GUI updates via timers and supports headless operation. No suspicious or malicious code segments, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines are evident. All external interactions appear related to hardware communication and GUI management. No credential hardcoding, file modifications, or network activities beyond expected data streaming are observed. The code appears well-structured for its intended purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate GUI application for signal processing with standard process and shared memory management. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected based on code analysis. It operates as designed for data acquisition and visualization, with no evident security risks or malware components.",
