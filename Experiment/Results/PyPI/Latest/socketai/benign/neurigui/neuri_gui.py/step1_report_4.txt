{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a PyQt5-based GUI application for real-time signal processing and data visualization, involving inter-process communication, hardware-specific sampling, and user interface management.",
  "sources": "Data sources include user inputs via GUI widgets, system environment variables, and inter-process shared memory (shared_buffer, shared_timestamp). External data may originate from hardware board-specific sampling functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets (pm.send_sock), shared memory (shared_buffer), and environment variables. Data could be transmitted over networks or written to files, but explicit file/network operations are not shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from GUI widgets (e.g., user controls for filters, themes) flows into processing routines. Shared memory data flows from sampling processes to visualization functions. The process_samples function sends data over a socket, which is a network sink.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code dynamically imports modules with fallback mechanisms, which could be seen as unusual but are typical for flexible module loading. No obfuscated code features or malware-like behaviors (such as reverse shells or data exfiltration) are evident. The only network activity is related to sending sampled data through pm.send_sock, which appears intended for data streaming.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a GUI application with multiprocessing to handle hardware sampling and real-time plotting. Shared memory facilitates data exchange between processes. The application manages a headless mode and a GUI mode, both operating with standard PyQt5 practices. The data flow involves sampling hardware data, possibly filtering or processing it, and transmitting it over a network socket. There are no signs of malicious code such as hardcoded credentials, data theft, or backdoors. The network socket usage is consistent with data streaming, not malicious exfiltration. The code uses standard libraries and patterns; no obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, complex GUI-based data acquisition and visualization tool with multiprocessing and network streaming capabilities. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It is well-structured, with no suspicious anomalies or obfuscated code features.",
