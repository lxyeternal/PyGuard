  "purpose": "A real-time GUI application for signal acquisition, processing, and visualization using multiprocessing, shared memory, and network streaming.",
  "sources": "Hardware sampling functions, shared memory buffers, network socket (pm.send_sock), GUI input widgets",
  "sinks": "Shared memory buffers, network socket for data streaming, GUI display updates",
  "flows": "Hardware sampling -> shared memory buffer -> GUI visualization; GUI inputs -> processing functions; network socket -> data transmission",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; exception handling broad but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard real-time data acquisition and visualization techniques with multiprocessing and shared memory. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. Network sockets are used for data streaming, which is typical. The code structure is clear, and the logic aligns with legitimate hardware monitoring applications. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The overall security posture is low risk, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured real-time signal processing GUI application with no malicious activity or sabotage detected. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
