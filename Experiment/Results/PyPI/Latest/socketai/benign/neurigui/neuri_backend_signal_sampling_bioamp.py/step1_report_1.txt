{
  "purpose": "This code processes EEG samples received via serial communication, converts messages to numerical data, and transmits the data over UDP while also managing shared memory and file storage.",
  "sources": "Reads raw message strings from serial port (`r.readline()`), reads parameters from the `parameter` dictionary, and accesses shared memory objects (`shared_buffer`, `shared_timestamp`, `gui_running`).",
  "sinks": "Sends UDP packets containing JSON-encoded relay data (`transmitter.sendto(bytes(dumps(relay_array), 'utf-8'), (udp_ip, udp_port))`), writes data to files via `IOManager.master_write_data()`, and updates shared memory (`shared_buffer[:]`, `shared_timestamp.value`).",
  "flows": "Raw message string from serial → `message_to_samples()` converts to numerical array → relay data populated → UDP transmission and shared memory update → optional file write after certain samples.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious hardcoded secrets observed. Use of try-except around import may hide import issues but not malicious. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected. The UDP data transmission sends data in JSON format without validation; however, this is standard for telemetry and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes serial communication and processes incoming data by converting raw messages into floating point numbers, populating relay messages, and transmitting over UDP. It maintains buffers, timestamps, and shared memory for real-time data streaming. The process includes normal data handling routines and file storage. There are no indications of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity beyond normal telemetry transmission. The import fallback for IOManager suggests compatibility but not malicious intent. No malicious patterns such as data theft, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be legitimate EEG data acquisition and transmission logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard data acquisition, processing, and transmission tasks for EEG signals with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It employs typical patterns for real-time sensor data handling. No security risks or malware indications are identified based on this code segment.",
