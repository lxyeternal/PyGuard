{
  "purpose": "The code processes incoming EEG data samples from a serial device, manages buffers, and transmits processed data over UDP for further analysis or display.",
  "sources": "Reads input from serial port (r.readline()), reads from shared memory (shared_buffer, shared_timestamp), and external configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over UDP (transmitter.sendto()), writes data to files via IOManager.master_write_data(), and sets the device to standby via r.write().",
  "flows": "Serial input (raw_message) -> message_to_samples() -> buffer_in -> relay_array -> transmitter.sendto() -> shared_buffer and shared_timestamp updates -> file writing via IOManager",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected. The code uses standard library functions and clear data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a data acquisition and relay system for EEG signals. It reads raw serial messages, converts them into numerical samples, buffers data, and transmits via UDP. It also manages shared memory for GUI updates and saves data periodically. The data handling appears standard, with no indications of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. External dependencies (json, time, numpy, io_manager) are used as expected. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity are present. All data flows are predictable, and no obfuscated or malicious code constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data acquisition and processing module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles EEG data in a typical manner, with standard security considerations. No malware signals or security risks are detected.",
