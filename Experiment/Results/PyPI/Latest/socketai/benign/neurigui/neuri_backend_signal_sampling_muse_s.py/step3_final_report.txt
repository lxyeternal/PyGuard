{
  "purpose": "The code implements a data acquisition and relay pipeline for EEG/PPG signals, converting incoming messages into numpy arrays, buffering data, transmitting over UDP, and storing data locally.",
  "sources": "pull_sample() from receiver, message_to_samples() processing incoming messages, shared_buffer and shared_timestamp for inter-process communication",
  "sinks": "UDP socket transmission of relay JSON messages, file storage via IOManager's master_write_data()",
  "flows": "Data read from receiver.pull_sample() -> message_to_samples() -> relay_array updates -> UDP sendto() -> shared_buffer and shared_timestamp updates -> periodic file write",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code is straightforward and transparent",
  "analysis": "The code processes incoming sensor data, converts messages into numpy arrays, buffers data, and transmits relay messages over UDP. It manages timestamps and buffers efficiently, with standard practices for real-time biosignal streaming. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. The data flow is typical for such applications, and external modules appear legitimate. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential minor network exposure. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent biosignal data acquisition and relay pipeline with no malicious or suspicious features. The low security risk score is justified by standard network transmission. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
