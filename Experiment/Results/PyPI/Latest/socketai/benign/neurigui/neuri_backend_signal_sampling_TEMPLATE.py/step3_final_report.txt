  "purpose": "Template for EEG data acquisition via serial communication, processing, and UDP transmission with shared memory and file logging.",
  "sources": "Serial port readline, message string from board",
  "sinks": "Bytes sent over UDP, shared memory buffer, timestamp variable, file writes",
  "flows": "Serial input -> message_to_samples() -> buffer array -> relay message -> UDP socket -> shared buffer & timestamp -> file logging",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder message_to_samples() function; no validation or parsing logic implemented",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a data collection template, reading serial data, converting it into a numpy array, updating buffers, and transmitting via UDP. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network addresses, or obfuscation are present. The message parsing is incomplete, but this is typical for a template, not an indicator of malicious intent. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's benign, placeholder nature. The main concern is operational, not security, related to incomplete message parsing. Overall, the code is straightforward and aligns with standard data acquisition practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data acquisition template with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The low risk score reflects its incomplete implementation, which is typical for a template, not a security vulnerability. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
