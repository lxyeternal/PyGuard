  "purpose": "The code provides a template for integrating a hardware board with the NeuriGUI, enabling sample data extraction, processing, and transmission via UDP.",
  "sources": "Reads incoming serial data from the hardware board using r.readline()",
  "sinks": "Sends data via UDP socket with transmitter.sendto()",
  "flows": "Serial input (r.readline()) → message_to_samples() → relay_array → transmitter.sendto() → shared_buffer and shared_timestamp",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data present. No obfuscated code, malicious network connections, or file manipulations detected. Usage of network transmission and serial data handling could be exploited if the input or network were compromised, but nothing indicates malicious intent within this code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard template for serial data acquisition, processing, and network transmission. It reads raw data from a serial port, converts it into a numpy array, and forwards it over UDP. The message_to_samples() method is a placeholder for parsing incoming messages; currently, it only initializes a default array and does not process actual data. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. The network communication is straightforward and typical for data streaming applications. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior is detected. Overall, the structure aligns with legitimate data handling without any signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured template intended for data acquisition and transmission. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indicators. The main concern could be its reliance on external data parsing (to be implemented) and network transmission, but these are standard features. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident.",
