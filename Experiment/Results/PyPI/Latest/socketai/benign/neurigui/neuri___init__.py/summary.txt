  "conclusion": "Most reports are correctly assessed as benign or non-existent code, with report 2 showing moderate suspicion. Adjustments to malware score in report 2 to 0.5 could improve accuracy, but current scores are consistent with the evidence. Overall, the assessments are reasonable and well-justified."
