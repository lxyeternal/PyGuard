  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, potential dynamic execution points like eval()/exec().",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, external network calls, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval()/exec() or environment variables flow into execution points or data handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec(), hardcoded secrets, suspicious control flow, obfuscation, or missing code.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign in reports 1, 3, 4, 5, with standard setup or no code present. Report 2 shows suspicious patterns like eval()/exec() and hardcoded secrets, indicating potential malicious intent. Scores reflect these observations: low malware and risk for benign code, moderate suspicion for report 2. Slightly increasing malware score in report 2 from 0.45 to 0.5 would better align with the suspicion level, but current scores are acceptable given the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are correctly assessed as benign or non-existent code, with report 2 showing moderate suspicion. Adjustments to malware score in report 2 to 0.5 could improve accuracy, but current scores are consistent with the evidence. Overall, the assessments are reasonable and well-justified.",
