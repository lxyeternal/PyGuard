  "purpose": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior based on the limited visible content.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or input points identified; code does not read external data or inputs in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leak points detected; no network connections, file modifications, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows; code execution paths do not involve untrusted data or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected; code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The security risk score is minimal (0.2), reflecting low threat level based on current visibility. The code's benign nature aligns with the scores assigned. No evidence suggests sabotage, data leakage, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall assessment indicates a safe dependency in the supply chain.",
