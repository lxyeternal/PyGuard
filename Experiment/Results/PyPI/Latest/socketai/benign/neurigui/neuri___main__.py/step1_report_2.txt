  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without explicit context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input functions, environment variables, and possibly from external modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or database operations, depending on imported modules and function calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources or environment variables through various functions, possibly reaching sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are visible. The code contains some dynamic execution or obfuscated constructs, but not conclusively malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard Python constructs, including imports, functions, and possibly some dynamic features. No suspicious network connections, cryptomining, or data exfiltration mechanisms are apparent. Use of third-party libraries appears typical. The overall structure does not suggest malicious intent, but incomplete context limits certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The code seems benign, with no significant security risks identified. However, due to limited visibility into the full code, a low confidence level is assigned.",
  "confidence": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0,
