  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose can be definitively determined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, possibly user inputs via functions, and external data files or network requests if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data returned to untrusted sources. Specific sinks are not explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to sinks such as network transmission or file storage. Exact paths cannot be fully traced without additional code context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual language features or dynamic execution observed. The code structure appears standard and clear.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing typical Python constructs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or misuse of environment variables. Usage of third-party libraries, if present, appears standard. No suspicious network activity or file operations are evident from the snippet. Without additional context or external dependencies, the code does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The code seems safe and typical for Python scripts, with no anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
