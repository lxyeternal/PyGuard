  "purpose": "The class provides simple encryption and decryption methods for tokens using multiple substitution levels with character replacement tables and string reversal.",
  "sources": "The input token provided to encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "The transformed token output from encrypt() and the input token to decrypt(). No other data outputs or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input token -> substitution based on level -> string reversal -> output encrypted token. Decryption reverses this process in reverse order.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code performs straightforward character substitutions and reversals without external interactions or hidden logic. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for encoding and decoding tokens using multiple substitution tables at different levels, combined with string reversal. The process appears to be a layered obfuscation scheme for tokens but does not include any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The substitution tables are static and contain no secret keys or credentials. The logic is straightforward and does not perform any suspicious actions. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent, only a custom encoding scheme.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple layered substitution cipher with string reversal, intended for obfuscating tokens. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign obfuscation tool rather than malware or a security threat.",
