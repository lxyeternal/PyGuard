{
  "purpose": "This class provides methods to encrypt and decrypt tokens through multiple levels of character substitution and string reversal, likely for obfuscation or simple encoding purposes.",
  "sources": "The input token to the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, particularly the 'token' parameter in both functions.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'encrypt' and the input to 'decrypt'; the final deobfuscated token. No external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input token -> substitution based on level-specific tables -> string reversal -> output encrypted token; Reverse process for decryption.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs multi-level character substitution and reversals, which could be used to obfuscate malicious payloads or hide malicious intent, but as written, it functions as a reversible obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a multi-level character substitution cipher with four transformation tables, designed for obfuscating tokens. The 'encrypt' method applies successive substitutions and reversals for each level, and 'decrypt' reverses these steps. No external inputs, network communications, or malicious functions are present. The code appears to be a straightforward multi-layer obfuscation mechanism, potentially used for hiding data or tokens but not inherently malicious. No signs of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a multi-level reversible obfuscation for tokens using substitution tables and reversals. There are no indications of malicious intent or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. It appears to be a benign encoding/decoding utility, possibly for obfuscation purposes.",
