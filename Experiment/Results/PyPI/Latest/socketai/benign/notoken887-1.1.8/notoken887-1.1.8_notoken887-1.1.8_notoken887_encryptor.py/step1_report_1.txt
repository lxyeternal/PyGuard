  "purpose": "A class for multi-level encoding and decoding of tokens using character replacement tables and reversal.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'token' for encryption, and 'encrypted_token' for decryption.",
  "sinks": "None that directly process untrusted data beyond simple string transformations.",
  "flows": "Input token -> character replacements at each level -> string reversal -> output; reverse process for decryption.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Replacement tables are static mappings. No network, file, or environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multi-level character substitution based on predefined lookup tables, combined with string reversal, to obscure and recover tokens. The process is straightforward and does not include any network calls, file I/O, or external data handling. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure operations are present. The logic appears to serve as a simple obfuscation or encoding mechanism rather than malicious activity. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious privacy violations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a multi-layer obfuscation mechanism for tokens, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility for encoding and decoding strings, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
