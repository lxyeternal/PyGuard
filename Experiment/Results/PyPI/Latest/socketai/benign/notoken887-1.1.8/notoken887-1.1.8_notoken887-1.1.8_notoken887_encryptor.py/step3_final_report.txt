  "purpose": "A multi-level character substitution and reversal utility for token obfuscation and de-obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Static substitution tables and input token string.",
  "sinks": "Reversal and substitution operations; no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input token -> substitution table -> reversal -> repeated per level -> output string with prefix; decryption reverses process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; static tables and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a deterministic multi-level obfuscation using static lookup tables and string reversal. The encrypt method applies substitution and reversal sequentially per level, then prefixes with 'ENC#'. The decrypt method removes the prefix, reverses, and applies inverse substitution per level. No external I/O, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The substitution tables are static and do not contain secrets or credentials. The process is reversible and purely for obfuscation, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign multi-level character substitution and reversal obfuscation utility. It does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The static tables and straightforward logic confirm its purpose as an encoding utility rather than malicious code.",
