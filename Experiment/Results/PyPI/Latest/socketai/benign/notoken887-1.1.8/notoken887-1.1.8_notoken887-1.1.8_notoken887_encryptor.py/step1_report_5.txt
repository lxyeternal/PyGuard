{
  "purpose": "This class provides a multi-level token encryption and decryption system using character substitution tables and string reversal for obfuscation.",
  "sources": "The input token provided to encrypt and decrypt methods, and internal class attribute dictionaries for substitution.",
  "sinks": "The encrypted token output from the encrypt method, and the decrypted token output from the decrypt method.",
  "flows": "Input token → substitution based on current level → string reversal → repeat for specified levels → output encrypted string with prefix 'ENC#'. Decryption reverses the process in reverse order.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive character substitution with no validation or sanitization. The tables are static, and the transformations are deterministic. No external inputs are processed that could lead to code injection. The code does not perform network operations, file access, or privilege escalation. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The methods are straightforward encoding/decoding routines with no hidden or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a multi-level obfuscation scheme for tokens, relying solely on character replacements and string reversal. The substitution tables are extensive but static, with no dynamic or external data handling. No malicious actions, such as data exfiltration, code execution, or system modification, are evident. The design appears to be intended for simple encoding/decoding or obfuscation, not malicious activity. No suspicious patterns or anomalies suggest malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an encoding/decoding utility with multi-level character substitution and reversal. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or malicious intent. It appears to be a benign obfuscation mechanism without any security risks or malware indicators.",
