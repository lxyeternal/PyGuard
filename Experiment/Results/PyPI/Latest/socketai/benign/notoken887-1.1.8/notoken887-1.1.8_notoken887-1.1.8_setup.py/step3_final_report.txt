{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script defines package metadata for distribution, with no dynamic or malicious code.",
  "sources": "Metadata fields such as author_email and url.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author_email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org', which are unprofessional and provocative but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard static setup configuration with no embedded executable code, obfuscation, or payloads. The only notable anomalies are metadata fields that are unprofessional but do not impact security. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are justified based on metadata concerns rather than code behavior. No evidence of malicious intent or supply chain risk is present within this script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign from a security perspective. The metadata contains provocative contact info, which raises reputational concerns but does not constitute malware or security risk. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
