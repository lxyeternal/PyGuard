  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious data flows.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, command-line arguments, external data sources, files, and user inputs.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, file writes, environment variable access, and dynamic code execution points such as eval() or exec().",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or external inputs to sinks such as system commands, network transmissions, or dynamic code execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec(), obfuscated strings or variable names, suspicious data flows, unverified external data sources, and inconsistent code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical suspicious features such as dynamic execution and obfuscation, indicating potential malicious intent. Benign scripts show straightforward data processing without suspicious patterns. The absence of code or placeholder scripts show no security concerns. The detailed analysis justifies high malware and obfuscation scores for suspicious code, while benign scripts receive low scores. The scores are consistent with the described features and behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Report 4's code demonstrates signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying a malware score of 0.65, obfuscated score of 0.7, and security risk of 0.75. Other reports are benign, with scores of zero or near-zero. The assessments are consistent and appropriate given the evidence. No further adjustments are necessary.",
