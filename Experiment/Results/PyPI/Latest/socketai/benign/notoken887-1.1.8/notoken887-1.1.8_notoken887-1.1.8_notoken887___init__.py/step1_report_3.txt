  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are observable due to the absence of operational code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no executable statements, functions, or logic; the entire script appears empty or uninitialized.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is either empty or a minimal placeholder without any import statements, functions, or data handling. There are no signs of data input, output, or processing. The lack of code makes it impossible to detect any malicious behavior or security issues. Given the absence of content, the code does not perform any actions that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The script appears to be an empty or placeholder file with no operational code. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the absence of code content.",
