  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The low risk score is justified given the lack of vulnerabilities or suspicious activity. The unused 'uvicorn' import is benign but should be reviewed for necessity. Overall, the supply chain security assessment indicates a secure, standard CLI script with minimal risk."
