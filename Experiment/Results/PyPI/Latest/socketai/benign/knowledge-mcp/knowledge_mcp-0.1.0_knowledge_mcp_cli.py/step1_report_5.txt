{
  "purpose": "This script serves as the command-line interface for managing and running a Knowledge Base MCP server and interactive shell.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration file path (args.config), command-line arguments, and environment variables for logging configuration.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes logs to file and stderr, but no untrusted data is directly used in security-sensitive functions. No data is sent over the network or to external systems.",
  "flows": "Configuration file path input flows into configuration loading; command-line arguments determine mode of operation; logging configuration is set up based on loaded config.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. Usage of standard libraries and explicit class imports are observed. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical CLI setup for a server and shell management system. It loads configuration from a specified file, sets up logging, and executes functions based on user input. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It handles exceptions gracefully and performs standard operations. No network communication, data leakage, or unsafe code practices are present. The code appears to be well-structured and secure with respect to supply chain threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI script for managing a knowledge system. No malicious intent or security risks are detected. The design uses standard practices without suspicious or malicious constructs.",
