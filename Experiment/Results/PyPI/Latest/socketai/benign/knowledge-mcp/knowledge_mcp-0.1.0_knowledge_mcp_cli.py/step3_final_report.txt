{
  "purpose": "This script serves as a command-line interface for managing a knowledge base MCP server and an interactive shell, loading configuration, setting up logging, and initializing core components.",
  "sources": "Configuration file specified via CLI argument; imported modules (knowledge_mcp.*); environment variables (if any used in imported modules).",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs to file and stderr; component initialization; no untrusted data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "CLI arguments → configuration loading → logging setup → mode selection (serve or shell) → component initialization and execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'uvicorn' which is benign but could be flagged as unnecessary; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI management script with configuration loading, logging setup, and mode execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The import of 'uvicorn' is unused, which is harmless but could be cleaned. No network activity, code injection, or secrets are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's content and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The low risk score is justified given the lack of vulnerabilities or suspicious activity. The unused 'uvicorn' import is benign but should be reviewed for necessity. Overall, the supply chain security assessment indicates a secure, standard CLI script with minimal risk.",
