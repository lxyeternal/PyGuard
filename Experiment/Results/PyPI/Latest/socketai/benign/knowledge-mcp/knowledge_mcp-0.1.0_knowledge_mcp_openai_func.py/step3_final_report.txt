{
  "purpose": "The code provides asynchronous functions to interact with OpenAI's completion and embedding APIs, retrieving API keys and model parameters from a singleton configuration object, and passing data to external API functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads API keys, model names, and URLs from the Config singleton; it also receives prompts and texts as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "External API functions (`openai_complete_if_cache`, `openai_embed`) where untrusted data (prompts, texts) are sent for processing.",
  "flows": "Input prompts/texts flow from function arguments to API functions, with API keys and parameters sourced from configuration, then data flows to external API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets; environment variable code is commented out; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages API keys via a singleton Config, avoiding hardcoded secrets. It uses async functions to wrap external API calls, passing user data and configuration parameters. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The code's structure is straightforward, with clear data flow from inputs to external API interactions. External functions are assumed standard. The security posture relies on proper configuration management; no signs of sabotage or malicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure API wrapper for OpenAI services, with secrets managed via configuration, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
