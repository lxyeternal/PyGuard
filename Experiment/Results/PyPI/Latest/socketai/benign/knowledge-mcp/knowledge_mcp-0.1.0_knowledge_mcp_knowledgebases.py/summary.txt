  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, secure module for managing knowledge bases. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities are evident. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's operations."
