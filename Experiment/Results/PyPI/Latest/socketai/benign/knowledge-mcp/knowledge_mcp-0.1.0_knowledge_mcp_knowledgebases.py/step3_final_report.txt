{
  "purpose": "Manages knowledge bases, including creation, loading, and querying, via filesystem operations and YAML configuration files.",
  "sources": "Reads from and writes to directories and config.yaml files within each knowledge base folder; reads config.yaml asynchronously using asyncio.to_thread.",
  "sinks": "Potentially reads untrusted YAML files; no external network or code injection activities detected.",
  "flows": "Loads config.yaml during initialization; creates directories and config files; reads configs asynchronously; deletes directories as needed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; proper error handling and safe YAML parsing used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem management with robust error handling, uses safe YAML parsing (`yaml.safe_load`), and employs asyncio for non-blocking file reads. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external network activity are present. Placeholder methods for document management are benign. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to YAML parsing errors, which are well-managed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, secure module for managing knowledge bases. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities are evident. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's operations.",
