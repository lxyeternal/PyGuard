{
  "purpose": "This script serves as the command-line interface for managing and running a Knowledge Base MCP server application, supporting serve and management modes.",
  "sources": "Configuration file specified via command-line argument; imported modules including Config, KnowledgeBaseManager, RagManager, Shell; user inputs via command-line arguments; shell command loop input.",
  "sinks": "Potential for command-line arguments to influence config loading; user inputs in the shell; untrusted config data could affect initialization or behavior.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> config file loading -> initialization of managers -> execution of serve or manage modes -> user commands in shell.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder server code with infinite loop; no actual network or external data handling shown; no obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution observed; comments suggest placeholders for server start logic.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly initializes components based on a config file and runs in either serve or manage mode. It imports modules that are not shown here, but their usage appears standard. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The infinite sleep loop in serve mode is a placeholder for a real server, not malicious. Shell interactions are typical for management interfaces. No hardcoded secrets or data leaks are detected. The configuration loading is straightforward, with error handling. Overall, the code functions as intended for a CLI app without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper for managing a server application with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The placeholders indicate future expansion rather than current malicious activity. Risks are minimal, primarily related to misconfiguration or improper handling of the config file, which is typical.",
