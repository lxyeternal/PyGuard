  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for managing and running a knowledge base server with 'serve' and 'manage' modes, loading configuration from a file.",
  "sources": "Configuration file (config.yml), user command inputs, imported modules (Config, KnowledgeBaseManager, RagManager, Shell), placeholders for server startup (uvicorn, time).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; user inputs influence command flow but not maliciously. No network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration loading -> component initialization -> mode-specific execution (serve or manage) -> interactive shell or placeholder server loop.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of unused imports (uvicorn, time) as placeholders; infinite sleep loop in serve mode as a placeholder for server activity; no actual network activity or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI application with configuration loading, component setup, and placeholders for server operation. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The placeholder server loop and imports suggest future development but are benign. Error handling and logging are standard. The code structure is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The placeholder elements are typical for scaffolding during development. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.2 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
