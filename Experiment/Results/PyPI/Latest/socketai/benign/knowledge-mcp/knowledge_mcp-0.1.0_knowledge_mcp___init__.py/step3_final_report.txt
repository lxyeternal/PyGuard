  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Limited code snippets, environment variables, data processing routines, environment reads, network/file operations, input data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data transmission, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, data inputs) to sinks (network, file, environment), with no suspicious or malicious data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected; code appears benign and standard.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate benign code with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate across all reports. Security risk scores of 0.2 are reasonable given the limited context but no evidence of threats. Confidence levels are mostly moderate to high, though lacking actual code review, so slightly conservative adjustments could be considered. Overall, the assessments are aligned with the descriptions, and no discrepancies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are accurate and consistent, correctly assigning low malware and obfuscation scores with minimal security risk. Given the limited information, the assessments are appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
