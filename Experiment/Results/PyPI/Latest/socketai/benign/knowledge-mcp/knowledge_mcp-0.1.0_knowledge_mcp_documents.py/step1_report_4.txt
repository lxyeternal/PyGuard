{
  "purpose": "Handles document loading, processing, and ingestion into knowledge bases using textract for text extraction and RagManager for knowledge base management.",
  "sources": "File path input to _extract_text; document file path in add method; textract.process call for text extraction.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in system commands, network connections, or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "File path input → textract.process for text extraction → extracted content → ingestion into RAG via rag.insert.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. Uses broad exception handling but does not perform insecure operations. No obfuscated or misleading code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs document processing with explicit support for various file types using textract. It handles errors and logs appropriately. It relies on external libraries without executing untrusted code. No network connections or sensitive data handling beyond file reading are present. Exception handling is broad but does not introduce security risks. Overall, the code is straightforward and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is secure, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code. It functions as a document ingestion pipeline without security issues. No supply chain attacks or malicious behaviors are detected.",
