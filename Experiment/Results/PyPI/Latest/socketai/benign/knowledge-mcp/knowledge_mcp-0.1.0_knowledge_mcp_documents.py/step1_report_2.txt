  "purpose": "This code manages document loading, extracting text content using textract, and ingesting it into a knowledge base managed by RagManager.",
  "sources": "Reads document file paths (doc_path), uses textract to process files, and retrieves RAG instances from RagManager.",
  "sinks": "Ingests text content into RAG instances via the insert method; potential risk if text content contains malicious input affecting RAG or related components.",
  "flows": "Reads document from filesystem → extracts text via textract → retrieves RAG instance → ingests text into RAG (via insert method).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. Use of broad exception catching is standard for robustness but can obscure specific error causes. No evidence of obfuscated code or malicious behaviors. Logging appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles document processing by verifying file existence, extracting text with textract, and asynchronously ingesting content into a knowledge base. Error handling and logging are present. No signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. It relies on external libraries and standard Python features. Potential minor concern: broad exception handling could mask specific issues, but this does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code performs intended document management functions without indications of malicious or sabotage behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward document ingestion utility that does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It handles files securely, uses external libraries as expected, and maintains good error handling. No evidence of supply chain or malicious code concerns.",
