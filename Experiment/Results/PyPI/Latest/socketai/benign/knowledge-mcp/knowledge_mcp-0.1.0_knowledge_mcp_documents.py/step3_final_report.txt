{
  "purpose": "The code loads local document files, extracts text content using textract, and asynchronously ingests the content into a RAG system for knowledge base population.",
  "sources": "Local filesystem paths provided as input; textract processing files; filename used as document ID.",
  "sinks": "The extracted text content is passed to the rag.insert method for ingestion into the knowledge base.",
  "flows": "File path -> textract.process -> decoded text -> rag.insert with document ID and file path.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of filenames as IDs could be manipulated if filenames are maliciously crafted, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard document ingestion: it verifies file existence, extracts text via textract, and inserts into a RAG system. Exception handling is broad but typical. No network activity or obfuscated code is present. The filename-based IDs could be a minor operational concern but do not constitute malicious activity. The overall logic is straightforward and relies on trusted libraries. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for document ingestion with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is very low, primarily operational. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1 to 0.2, justified by minimal operational concerns.",
