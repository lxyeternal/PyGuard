  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for document ingestion with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is very low, primarily operational. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1 to 0.2, justified by minimal operational concerns."
