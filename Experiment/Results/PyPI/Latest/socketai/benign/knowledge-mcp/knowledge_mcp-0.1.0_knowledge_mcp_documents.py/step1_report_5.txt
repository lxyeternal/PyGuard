{
  "purpose": "Handles document loading, processing, and ingestion into knowledge bases using textract for text extraction and RagManager for managing RAG instances.",
  "sources": "Reads document files from the filesystem (Path object), potentially from user-supplied paths.",
  "sinks": "Calls textract.process() for text extraction; interacts with rag.insert() to ingest content into a knowledge base.",
  "flows": "Reads document path -> extracts text with textract -> passes text to rag.insert() for ingestion.",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad exception handling which may obscure specific errors; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code observed; relies on external textract library which is standard; no suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file reading and text extraction operations, wrapping textract calls with exception handling. It then asynchronously ingests the extracted text into a RAG system. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, backdoors, or manipulation. Exception handling is broad but benign. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic detected. The only potential concern is reliance on textract, which could be manipulated if the environment is compromised, but this is an external dependency, not malicious code itself. The overall structure and code appear typical for a document ingestion pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a document ingestion system with no evident malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It handles errors gracefully and does not perform any suspicious actions. The overall security risk is low.",
