  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's function—loading files, extracting text via textract, and ingesting into RAG.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Clear flow from file path to textract to RAG insertion.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code patterns or malicious behaviors. The only minor point is the use of filename as ID, which is benign but could be manipulated if filenames are maliciously crafted—however, this alone isn't malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent detected, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The logic is sound, and no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or behaviors. Broad exception handling is noted but is standard for robustness.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, high confidence (0.95), malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears straightforward and secure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with the code's intent.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly described.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors or code patterns. No network activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The logic remains benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or suspicious patterns. Uses broad exception handling but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is standard and secure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behaviors detected. Reliance on textract is standard, and no suspicious code patterns are present.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malware (0). The code does not perform any malicious actions, network communication, or code obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate no obfuscation (0). The code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher (0.1–0.2) mainly due to the filename-based IDs and broad exception handling, but these are not security risks per se.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1–0.2** — minimal, mainly operational concerns, not security threats.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The use of filenames as IDs could be exploited if filenames are maliciously crafted, but this is a minor operational concern, not a security risk.\n- Broad exception handling, while sometimes discouraged, does not imply malicious intent; it’s a standard practice to ensure robustness.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured document ingestion utility with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to account for minor operational considerations, but not security threats)",
