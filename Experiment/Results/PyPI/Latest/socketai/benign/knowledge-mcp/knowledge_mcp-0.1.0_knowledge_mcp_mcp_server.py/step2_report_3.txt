  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, standard validation, no obfuscation, logging of input questions (which could be privacy concern but not malicious). The external dependencies 'rag_manager' and 'kb_manager' could contain risks but are not part of this code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The security risk is low, considering the code's straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1—standard practices, no suspicious patterns, proper exception handling, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No malicious indicators, and the reasoning aligns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—standard, validated inputs, no obfuscation, no suspicious activity, just logging of large responses which could leak sensitive info but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports—no malicious behavior, proper validation, exception handling, no obfuscation, no suspicious network or code activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- **Findings:** Same overall conclusion—no signs of malicious activity, standard patterns, no obfuscation, proper validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is justified given the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the low inherent risk of such server code, assuming dependencies are secure.\n- **Confidence:** High, as all reports agree.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — appropriate given the low risk, but monitor dependencies.\n- **Justification for risk:** The main concern would be external dependencies ('rag_manager', 'kb_manager') potentially containing vulnerabilities or malicious code, but within this code snippet, there are no indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and justified. The code appears secure, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score is appropriate, assuming external modules are trustworthy.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nProceed with monitoring external dependencies and ensure proper security practices in those modules.",
