{
  "purpose": "The code provides a server interface for interacting with knowledge bases via retrieval and answer generation tools, encapsulating these functionalities in a FastMCP service.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'params' objects (RetrieveParams, AnswerParams) which receive user queries and parameters; the knowledge base manager and rag manager which provide data and query results.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the return of query results, which are converted to strings and returned; exceptions raised from invalid input or internal errors; JSON serialization of knowledge base listings.",
  "flows": "User inputs are passed through data models to the retrieve and answer functions, which invoke asynchronous methods of rag_manager with user queries, and the list_knowledgebases method fetches knowledge base info; results or errors are propagated back as strings or exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The code does not include obfuscated or dynamically executed code. The only notable aspect is standard error handling and data serialization; no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward API wrapper around knowledge base querying components, with proper input validation, exception handling, and logging. It does not include malicious code or behavior such as data exfiltration, network communications outside expected scope, or backdoors. The functions perform expected data retrieval and formatting tasks. No hidden or malicious logic is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign server component designed for knowledge base interaction. It adheres to standard patterns without suspicious or malicious elements. The overall security risk is minimal, with no indication of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage.",
