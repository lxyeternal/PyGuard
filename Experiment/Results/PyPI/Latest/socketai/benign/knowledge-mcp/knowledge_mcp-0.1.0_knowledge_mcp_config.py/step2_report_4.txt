  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described logic, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Loads YAML configuration files.\n- Supports environment variable substitution within the YAML content using regex.\n- Can load environment variables from a specified `.env` file.\n- Resolves relative paths based on the config file location.\n- Validates configuration data with Pydantic models.\n- Implements singleton pattern for configuration access.\n- Handles errors gracefully.\n- No suspicious or malicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks:** No data sinks, only environment variables used for substitution.\n- **Flows:** Correctly describes the flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low).\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks:** No malicious sinks; environment variables influence behavior but are standard.\n- **Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or backdoors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard configuration loader.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks:** Environment variables can influence behavior, but this is typical.\n- **Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or malicious code; env var substitution is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just standard env var substitution.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks:** No malicious sinks; environment variables loaded and used for substitution.\n- **Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; env var substitution is safe.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard configuration pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks:** No malicious sinks; environment variables loaded from files and OS.\n- **Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard config loader.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall observations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. The code does not perform any network activity, code execution, or malicious modifications.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0, but justified given environment variable substitution and path resolution, which could be misused if environment variables are maliciously set externally. However, these are common patterns and do not constitute significant risk in themselves.\n\n### **Final evaluation:**\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk:** Given the standard use of env var substitution and path resolution, a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified, aligning with the reports.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, standard configuration handling with env vars; potential external manipulation exists but is typical.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears safe, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor risk stems from environment variable handling, which is a common and accepted pattern in configuration management.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep risk score low, malware and obfuscated scores at zero. The code is suitable for production with standard precautions around environment variable security.",
