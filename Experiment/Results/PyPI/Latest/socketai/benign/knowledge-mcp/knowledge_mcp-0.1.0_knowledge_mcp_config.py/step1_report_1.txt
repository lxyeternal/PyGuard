{
  "purpose": "The code manages application configuration by loading YAML files, supporting environment variable substitution, and providing singleton access to the configuration data.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from a YAML file, environment variables from the OS, and optionally loads variables from a specified .env file.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables for substitution within configuration values; no direct data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Reads config file -> substitutes environment variables -> resolves paths -> loads environment variables from .env -> validates and creates singleton config instance.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code, malicious network connections, or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard configuration file reading with environment variable substitution and validation via Pydantic models. It loads environment variables from a specified .env file, supports relative path resolution, and manages singleton access to the config. There are no signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or harmful behaviors. The code handles errors gracefully and does not perform any suspicious operations beyond standard configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration loader with environment variable support and singleton pattern. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
