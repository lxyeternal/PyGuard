  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, secure configuration loader with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The environment variable substitution is standard and not inherently malicious. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correct. Overall, it is safe for production use assuming environment variables are managed securely."
