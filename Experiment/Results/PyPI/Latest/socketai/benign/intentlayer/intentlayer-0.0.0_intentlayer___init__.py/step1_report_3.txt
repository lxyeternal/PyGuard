  "flows": "import_module('intentlayer_sdk') -> updating globals() with _sdk's __dict__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of import_module with a hardcoded module name is common, but dynamically updating globals() can be risky if the imported module contains malicious code or attributes. No explicit input sources or network activity is present here.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a dynamic import of the 'intentlayer_sdk' module using importlib.import_module, then updates the global namespace with all attributes from that module, including potentially '__all__' if it exists. This pattern allows for flexible extension but can be dangerous if the module is malicious or compromised, as it can inject arbitrary code into the global namespace. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behavior beyond the dynamic attribute injection. The code itself is simple and does not contain direct malicious actions, but the risk depends entirely on the integrity of 'intentlayer_sdk'.",
  "conclusion": "The code dynamically loads a module and injects its attributes into the global namespace. While straightforward, this pattern can be risky if the imported module is malicious. There are no explicit malicious behaviors or obfuscation detected; the main concern is trust in the 'intentlayer_sdk' module.",
