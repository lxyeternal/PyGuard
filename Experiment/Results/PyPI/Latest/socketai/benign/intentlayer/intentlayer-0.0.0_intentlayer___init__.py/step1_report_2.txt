  "purpose": "Dynamically imports the 'intentlayer_sdk' module and updates the global namespace with its attributes.",
  "sources": "The import_module function from importlib to load 'intentlayer_sdk'.",
  "sinks": "Updating globals() with the SDK's __dict__, potentially exposing all attributes including private or sensitive ones.",
  "flows": "import_module loads the module; the module's attributes are then injected into the global namespace via globals().update().",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and update of globals() can obscure the origin of functions and variables, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code. No explicit hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present, but the pattern can be risky if the imported module is malicious or compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a dynamic import of a module named 'intentlayer_sdk' using importlib.import_module, which allows for flexible module loading at runtime. It then updates the current global namespace with all attributes from the imported module, potentially exposing all its internals directly in the global scope. The use of __all__ as a list of exported symbols is standard, but the dynamic update of globals() can hide the source of functions and variables, which is often considered a risky practice. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. However, this pattern can be exploited if the imported module is malicious or compromised, leading to unintended execution or privilege escalation.",
  "conclusion": "The code dynamically loads an external SDK and exposes its attributes globally, which can be risky if the SDK is malicious or compromised. No explicit malicious behavior is evident, but the pattern itself warrants caution due to potential obfuscation and scope pollution.",
