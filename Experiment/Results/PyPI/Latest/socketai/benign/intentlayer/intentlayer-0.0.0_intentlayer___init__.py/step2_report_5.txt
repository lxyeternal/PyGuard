  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Review:**\n```python\nfrom importlib import import_module as _im\n_sdk = _im(\"intentlayer_sdk\")\nglobals().update(_sdk.__dict__)\n__all__ = getattr(_sdk, \"__all__\", [])\n```\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Dynamically imports `intentlayer_sdk` using `import_module`.\n- Updates the global namespace with all attributes from `_sdk`.\n- Sets `__all__` to the SDK's `__all__` if it exists.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code **does** perform dynamic import and global namespace update as described.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- No malware or malicious code is directly present in this snippet.\n- The technique is common in plugin systems or SDK integrations but carries inherent risks if the imported module is malicious or compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Presence:\n- The reports are consistent with the code: no signs of malware, obfuscation, or direct malicious behavior.\n- The pattern of dynamically importing and injecting into globals is risky if the source is untrusted, but the code itself is benign.\n\n### Logical/Reasoning Flaws:\n- No logical errors or mistakes are present in the reports.\n- The risk assessment scores are generally aligned with the analysis: the main concern is trustworthiness of the `intentlayer_sdk` module, not the code itself.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.3 to 0.4, reflecting moderate concern about trusting the external module.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- Given the nature of the code, a **risk score** of around **0.3 to 0.4** seems appropriate, reflecting that the main concern is the trustworthiness of the external module, not the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 (moderate, due to reliance on external untrusted code)\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- If the `intentlayer_sdk` is from a trusted source, the risk is minimal.\n- If the source is untrusted or unknown, the pattern itself is risky because it exposes all attributes globally, which could include malicious code if the module is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is straightforward and does not contain malware or obfuscation.\n- The main risk stems from trusting the external module.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should be maintained unless new evidence arises.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.3\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to re-evaluate any specific report or provide further insights.",
