  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code snippet.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom importlib import import_module as _im\n_sdk = _im(\"intentlayer_sdk\")\nglobals().update(_sdk.__dict__)\n__all__ = getattr(_sdk, \"__all__\", [])\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code performs a dynamic import of `'intentlayer_sdk'`.\n- It updates the global namespace with all attributes from `_sdk`.\n- It sets `__all__` based on `_sdk.__all__` if available.\n\n**No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads** are present in this snippet itself. The pattern is common in plugin systems or SDK integrations but carries inherent risks if the imported module is malicious or compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Correctly describes dynamic import and namespace update.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation, just a standard pattern with potential security implications if the source is untrusted.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately cautious. Confidence 0.8 is reasonable.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.3 — reasonable, given the potential for malicious SDKs.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Correctly describes the import and update process.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Highlights risks of exposing private or sensitive attributes, which is valid.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate caution. Confidence 0.8 matches the analysis.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0, consistent.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher at 0.4, justified by the potential for malicious SDKs.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Correctly states the import and global namespace update.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Emphasizes the risk if the module is malicious, which is valid.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate. Confidence 0.7 is reasonable.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0, aligns with the evidence.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.3, acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Highlights the potential risk of malicious modules, which is valid.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate. Confidence 0.8 is justified.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.3, consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and balanced.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Emphasizes the potential danger of namespace pollution and malicious modules.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Reasonable. Confidence 0.8.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher at 0.4, justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Observations:\n- All reports agree that the code pattern is common but potentially risky if the imported module is malicious.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity are evident in the code snippet itself.\n- The risk scores are appropriately conservative, given the pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — straightforward code, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3–0.4 — reflects the potential danger if the external module is malicious, which is a standard concern for dynamic imports and namespace pollution.\n\n**Given the information, I would assign:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| Malware         | 0            |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            |\n| Risk            | 0.3          |\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code itself is benign but relies on external trust. The reports are consistent and accurate in their caution. No modifications are necessary; the scores are appropriate based on the evidence.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Treat the pattern as a security concern if the source of `'intentlayer_sdk'` is untrusted, but the code snippet itself is not malicious.",
