  "purpose": "Dynamically imports the 'intentlayer_sdk' module and updates the global namespace with its attributes.",
  "sources": "import_module function call for 'intentlayer_sdk'",
  "sinks": "Updating globals with module attributes can potentially lead to execution of malicious code if the imported module is malicious.",
  "flows": "import_module(_sdk) -> globals().update(_sdk.__dict__)",
  "anomalies": "Using import_module with a string module name is normal; however, dynamically updating globals can be risky if the imported module is malicious or compromised. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'import_module' function from 'importlib' and uses it to import a module named 'intentlayer_sdk'. It then updates the global namespace with the module's dictionary, effectively importing all attributes of that module into the current namespace. This approach can be risky if the module is untrusted, as it could execute malicious code upon import or define malicious attributes. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated parts. The dynamic import and namespace update are common in plugin systems but can be exploited if the module source is malicious. There are no signs of malware, such as network communication, file manipulation, or hidden backdoors. Overall, the code itself is straightforward but depends heavily on the trustworthiness of the 'intentlayer_sdk' module.",
  "conclusion": "The code dynamically imports a module and extends the global namespace with its contents. While the code itself appears benign, it can be malicious if the imported module is compromised. No obvious malicious behavior is detected in this snippet, but it warrants caution regarding the source of the 'intentlayer_sdk' module.",
