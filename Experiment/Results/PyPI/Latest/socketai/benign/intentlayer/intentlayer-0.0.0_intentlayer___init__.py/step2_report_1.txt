  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom importlib import import_module as _im\n_sdk = _im(\"intentlayer_sdk\")\nglobals().update(_sdk.__dict__)\n__all__ = getattr(_sdk, \"__all__\", [])\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code performs a dynamic import of `intentlayer_sdk`.\n- It updates the global namespace with all attributes from `_sdk`.\n- It sets `__all__` based on `_sdk.__all__` if present.\n\n**No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code within this snippet.** The main concern is the trustworthiness of the imported module.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Summary:** Correctly describes the dynamic import and global namespace update.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the potential security risk if the module is malicious but finds no direct malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. The risk score reflects the potential danger due to dynamic import and global update.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on exposing all attributes, including private ones.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the risk if the module is malicious or compromised.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.4.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly higher risk score justified due to potential scope pollution.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, with focus on trust issues.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the pattern as risky if the module is malicious.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Summary:** Similar, with focus on the pattern's risks.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected; the pattern is standard but risky if the module is malicious.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, emphasizes potential maliciousness if the module is compromised.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malware or obfuscation; the concern is trust.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.4.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Obfuscation Scores:\n- All reports agree on zero malware and obfuscation.\n- The pattern is common but can be exploited if the imported module is malicious.\n\n### Overall Risk Score:\n- The risk scores are mostly between 0.3 and 0.4, reflecting a moderate concern primarily due to dynamic import and global namespace pollution.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code in the snippet).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected).\n- **Risk score:** Given the pattern's potential for misuse, I would assign a **risk score of 0.4** — slightly higher than some reports, to reflect the inherent danger of dynamically importing and injecting code into the global namespace.\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The core concern isn't with the code itself but with the trustworthiness of `intentlayer_sdk`.\n- If this SDK is from a trusted source, the pattern is acceptable; if not, it could be exploited.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n| Score Type     | Final Score |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| Malware        | 0            |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            |\n| Security Risk  | 0.4          |\n\nThis balanced assessment considers the technical pattern and potential security implications without assuming malicious intent where none is evident.",
