  "purpose": "Dynamically imports the 'intentlayer_sdk' module and exposes its attributes in the current module's namespace.",
  "sources": "The import_module function from importlib, specifically importing 'intentlayer_sdk'.",
  "sinks": "Updating the global namespace with the SDK's dictionary, which could include functions or variables with side effects if misused.",
  "flows": "Import module -> retrieve its attributes -> update global namespace with these attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of import_module for dynamic import; this pattern can obscure the actual code being imported. No explicit hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are visible. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports a module named 'intentlayer_sdk' at runtime, then copies all its attributes into the global namespace, and optionally exposes its __all__ list. This approach allows the module to execute code from 'intentlayer_sdk' directly in the current namespace, which can be risky if the imported module is malicious or compromised. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior within this snippet itself. The technique is common in plugin systems or SDK integrations but can be misused if the module source is malicious or untrusted. Overall, the code itself is straightforward and does not contain malicious payloads, but its reliance on dynamic import warrants caution if the source is untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a dynamic import of a specific SDK module and exposes its contents globally, which is a standard pattern in plugin architectures but could pose security risks if the module is malicious or compromised. There are no signs of malware or obfuscation within this snippet, but the dynamic import method warrants careful trust assessment of the 'intentlayer_sdk' package.",
