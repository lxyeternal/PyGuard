  "purpose": "Dynamically imports 'intentlayer_sdk' and exposes its attributes globally, facilitating SDK integration.",

  "flows": "Source: import_module call -> Sink: globals().update() and __all__ assignment",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and globals().update() without validation; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard dynamic import of an SDK and exposes all its attributes globally, which is common in plugin or SDK patterns but can be risky if the source is untrusted. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present within this snippet. The main concern is the trustworthiness of 'intentlayer_sdk'. The pattern itself does not involve malicious activity but could be exploited if the imported module is malicious. The risk score should reflect the potential danger of injecting untrusted code into the global namespace, which is moderate. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, consistent with the absence of malicious or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is estimated at 0.3-0.4, considering the pattern's potential for misuse.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign but relies on the trustworthiness of the external SDK. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is found. The primary concern is the potential risk if the imported module is malicious. The scores are appropriate; a moderate risk score of 0.3-0.4 is justified given the pattern, but no malicious activity is evident.",
