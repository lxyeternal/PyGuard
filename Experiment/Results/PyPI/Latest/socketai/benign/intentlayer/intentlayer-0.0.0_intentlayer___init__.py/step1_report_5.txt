  "purpose": "Dynamically imports a module named 'intentlayer_sdk' and updates the global namespace with its attributes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it loads a module dynamically using import_module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially updates the global namespace with all attributes from the imported module, which could introduce malicious code if the module itself is malicious.",
  "flows": "Import of 'intentlayer_sdk' -> updating globals with module's attributes -> optional access via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of import_module with a hardcoded module name and updating globals dynamically can be suspicious, especially if the source module is malicious or untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a dynamic import of 'intentlayer_sdk' using importlib.import_module, then updates the global namespace with all attributes from this module. It also sets __all__ to control exports. This pattern is not inherently malicious but can be dangerous if 'intentlayer_sdk' is malicious or compromised, as it executes code from that module and injects all its attributes into the global namespace, potentially executing malicious code or causing side effects. There are no apparent obfuscated elements or suspicious behaviors outside the dynamic import and namespace update, which are legitimate Python techniques but can be exploited for malicious purposes if used untrustworthily.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary behavior is to import a module dynamically and expose its attributes globally. While this is not inherently malicious, it could be used maliciously if the 'intentlayer_sdk' module is compromised or malicious. The code itself does not contain malware or obfuscation but relies on external trust in the imported module.",
