  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval(), exec(), network socket operations, environment variables, user input, and untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Network communication endpoints, system files, environment variables, output functions, and dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or environment variables flow into eval()/exec() or network sockets, potentially leading to data exfiltration, code execution, or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, network socket operations, and potential lack of input validation; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains dynamic code execution functions (eval(), exec()) and network socket operations, which are typical red flags for malicious activity if used on untrusted data. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate; however, given the potential risks, especially in Report 2, the malware score should be increased from 0.2 to 0.4 to better reflect the threat level. Other reports are benign with no suspicious patterns. The overall security risk remains moderate for Report 2 due to dynamic features but low for others.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign; however, dynamic code execution and network activity in Report 2 warrant a higher malware score and increased vigilance. Scores are adjusted to better align with potential threat levels, emphasizing the importance of monitoring dynamic features and network communications in supply chain security assessments.",
