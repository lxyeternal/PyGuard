  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Package metadata such as name, version, author, description, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code primarily handles static package metadata.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration reads static data and passes it to the setuptools.setup() function, with no external data flow or input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors. The author email and URL are unconventional but not inherently malicious. No obfuscated or dynamic code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools. It contains package metadata with no user input or external data processing. The email address provided is suspicious (hitler@gmail.com), but this is a social or ethical concern, not a security issue. No signs of malware, malicious code, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable point is the questionable email address, which does not impact security but may be unprofessional.",
