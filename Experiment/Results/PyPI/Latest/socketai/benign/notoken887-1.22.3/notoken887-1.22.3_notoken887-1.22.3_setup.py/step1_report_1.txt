  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'notoken887' Python library.",
  "sources": "N/A - No input or data reading functions; static metadata only.",
  "sinks": "N/A - No untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from source to sink, as this is a setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an intentionally provocative email ('hitler@gmail.com') and a suspicious URL ('https://thugging.org'). The author name 'Yous' and description 'my obfuscation test lib' suggest possible obfuscation or testing intentions. No actual malicious code or obfuscation detected, but the metadata contains potential red flags.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python library. There are no functions, no code execution, and no dynamic behavior. The author, email, description, and URL are static strings. The email and URL are suspicious and could be intended to mislead or test detection tools. No malicious code, code injection, or suspicious activity detected within this script. The presence of provocative email and URL may be intentional for testing or obfuscation purposes but do not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a standard packaging configuration with some red-flag metadata (email and URL). There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware within this code snippet. The metadata may be intentionally provocative or for testing, but the code itself is benign.",
