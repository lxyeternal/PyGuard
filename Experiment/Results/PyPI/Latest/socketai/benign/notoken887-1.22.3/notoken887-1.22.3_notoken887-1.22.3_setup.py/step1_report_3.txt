  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'notoken887' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Input data from package parameters (name, version, author, email, description, url, classifiers, python_requires).",
  "sinks": "N/A; no untrusted data processing or insecure outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Package configuration data flows from the setup() parameters without any external data input or untrusted source.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a suspicious email 'hitler@gmail.com', which is inappropriate and unprofessional; the URL 'https://thugging.org' is also suspicious and potentially malicious or misleading. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata. It contains no code execution, data processing, or external inputs beyond static package info. The only notable issues are the inappropriate email and URL, which may be intended as misdirection or malicious branding. No security flaws, malware, or obfuscation are present. The script's structure is straightforward and typical for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple package setup script with unprofessional and potentially malicious contact information and URL. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks in the code itself, but the provided contact details are suspicious.",
