  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters such as name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external data processing.",
  "flows": "The data flows from static parameters into the setup() call, which is used for package distribution; no dynamic or untrusted data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of suspicious email address 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org', which may suggest malicious intent or inappropriate content. No code obfuscation or malicious code included.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools. All parameters are static strings with no input handling or dynamic execution. The author email and URL are unusual and potentially malicious, but no actual malicious code or behavior is present. No obfuscation or malware indicators are detected. Overall, this appears to be a normal setup script with suspicious metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, but contains suspicious contact information and URL that could imply malicious intent or at least unprofessional content. No malicious code or malware detected.",
