{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple encryption and decryption of tokens using substitution tables.",
  "sources": "The methods read input tokens via parameters 'token' and 'encrypted_token'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or untrusted data effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input tokens are transformed via character substitution in 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods.",
  "anomalies": "The substitution tables are minimal, only replacing 'M' with 'x' and vice versa; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements basic substitution cipher logic without any external data sources or insecure patterns. It does not perform any system calls, network operations, or data leaks. The functions are straightforward and limited to character replacements. No anomalies or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious implementation of substitution cipher logic. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior based on the provided content.",
