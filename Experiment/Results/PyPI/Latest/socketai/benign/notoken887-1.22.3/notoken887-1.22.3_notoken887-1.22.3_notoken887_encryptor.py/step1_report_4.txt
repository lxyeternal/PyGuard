  "purpose": "This class provides simple substitution-based encryption and decryption of tokens using predefined lookup tables.",
  "sources": "Input token to encrypt or decrypt functions, specifically the 'token' and 'encrypted_token' parameters.",
  "sinks": "Returns from encrypt and decrypt methods; no direct untrusted data sinks are present within the code.",
  "flows": "Input token → substitution table lookup → transformed string → output; same for decryption.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses very simplistic substitution tables which do not provide security, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a basic substitution cipher with one mapping 'M' to 'x' and back. The methods perform character-by-character translation based on these lookup tables. There are no external data sources, no network activity, and no code injection or data leakage mechanisms. The simplicity of the cipher indicates it is not meant for security but for obfuscation, which is not malicious per se. No obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns, or anomalous behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a trivial substitution cipher without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks. The security implications are minimal, and it appears to serve a basic obfuscation purpose.",
