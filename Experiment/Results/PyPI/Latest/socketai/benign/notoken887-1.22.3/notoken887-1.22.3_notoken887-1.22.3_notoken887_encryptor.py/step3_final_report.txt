  "purpose": "A simple substitution cipher class for token transformation, using minimal character mappings.",
  "sources": "The encrypt and decrypt methods process input tokens character-by-character, referencing static substitution tables.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or sinks; no system calls, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input tokens are transformed via character substitution; no external data flows or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a trivial substitution cipher with static tables for 'M' and 'x'. It performs simple character replacements without external dependencies, system calls, or malicious behavior. The substitution is insecure cryptographically but benign in intent. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are evident. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate low security risk and no malware presence. The substitution tables are minimal, and the code is transparent, with no obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, trivial substitution utility with no malicious intent or security threats. The scores and assessments across the reports are accurate and align with the code's straightforward nature. No modifications are necessary; the current evaluation accurately reflects the benign and non-malicious characteristics of the code.",
