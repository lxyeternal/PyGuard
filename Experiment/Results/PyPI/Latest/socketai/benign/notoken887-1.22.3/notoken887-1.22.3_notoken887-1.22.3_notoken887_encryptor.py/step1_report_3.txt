  "purpose": "The code provides simple encryption and decryption functions for tokens using substitution tables.",
  "sources": "Input tokens to the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "The transformed tokens returned by encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "flows": "Input token -> replace characters based on substitution table -> output transformed token.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The substitution tables are minimal and static. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The class performs straightforward character replacement for token encryption and decryption. The replacement and decryption tables are symmetric and static, with no external input or secret management. No external data sources, no network calls, no system modifications. The code appears to be a simple cipher implementation without malicious intent or security risks. The minimal substitution is not secure for cryptographic purposes but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, non-malicious token transformation utility with no evidence of malware or security risks. It functions as a basic character substitution cipher, which is not secure but does not indicate malicious intent.",
