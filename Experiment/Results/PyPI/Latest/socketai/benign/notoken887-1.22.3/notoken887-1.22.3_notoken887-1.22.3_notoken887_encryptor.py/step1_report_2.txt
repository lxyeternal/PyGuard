{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple substitution cipher for encrypting and decrypting tokens using predefined replacement and decryption tables.",
  "sources": "The methods 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' read input tokens passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code returns transformed strings but does not send data elsewhere or perform side effects.",
  "flows": "Input token → 'encrypt' or 'decrypt' method → substitution using lookup tables → output transformed token.",
  "anomalies": "The substitution tables are very limited, only replacing 'M' with 'x' and vice versa, indicating minimal obfuscation or security. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. No unusual language features or dynamic code execution are used.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a straightforward character substitution cipher with minimal complexity. It reads input tokens via method parameters and returns transformed strings. The lookup tables are static and simple, indicating this is likely for obfuscation or a very basic encoding rather than security. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity is evident. The code does not interact with external systems, files, or network resources. There are no signs of malicious privacy violations, backdoors, or malware. It appears to be a benign utility with limited functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple substitution cipher utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It neither contains malware nor poses any immediate threat. The minimal substitution suggests it is not intended for secure encryption but rather for simple obfuscation or token transformation.",
