  "purpose": "A simple class for encrypting and decrypting tokens using substitution tables.",
  "sources": "The encrypt() and decrypt() methods which read input tokens and encrypted tokens respectively.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not write or transmit data directly, nor does it invoke external systems.",
  "flows": "Input token -> encrypt() or decrypt() method -> transformed token (via substitution tables).",
  "anomalies": "The substitution is very simplistic; no external data or environment variables are used; no suspicious or malicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets beyond the simple table, which does not appear malicious. No obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The class provides basic character substitution encryption and decryption with hardcoded tables. It performs straightforward string transformations without external dependencies or complex logic. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident. The security of the encryption is weak, but that does not imply malicious intent. No external data flows or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, non-malicious token transformer with no signs of malware or security risks. It appears to be intended for simple obfuscation rather than secure encryption. No malicious behavior or anomalies are detected.",
