  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which loads 'speak_text' from the local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling in this snippet; it only imports a function.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this minimal code snippet; it merely imports a function.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, only an import statement. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'speak_text' from a local module '.core'. There is no input handling, no data processing, and no execution of potentially malicious code. Since this is a minimal snippet, it provides no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Without additional context, this appears to be a standard import statement.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is likely part of a larger program that uses the 'speak_text' function.",
