  "purpose": "Import the 'speak_text' function from a local module named 'core'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'core' when importing 'speak_text'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data flows or untrusted inputs are processed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs an import statement with no data flow or execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a simple import of 'speak_text' from a local module 'core'. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or insecure practices. The minimal structure and lack of dynamic code execution reduce concerns about obfuscation or malware. Since the code only involves an import statement, it doesn't reveal any security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a basic import with no suspicious activity or security concerns.",
