  "purpose": "Assess the benign nature of a simple import statement in a Python package, ensuring no malicious activity or security risks are present.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module: 'from .core import speak_text'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leakage points are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs a static import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0. Confidence scores are high (0.8–1), reflecting certainty in benign assessment. The slight variation in security risk scores (some at 0.1) is overly cautious; given the minimal code, a score of 0 is more appropriate. No logical flaws or anomalies are present. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity support a conclusion of no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate, except for a minor overestimation of risk in some cases. The overall assessment confirms no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are present in this import statement.",
