{
  "purpose": "Convert large text to speech using asynchronous processing, text splitting, and local playback.",
  "sources": "Reads input text, creates temporary audio files, and uses external TTS API via edge_tts.",
  "sinks": "Generated audio data in memory, played locally with sounddevice, and temporary files deleted after use.",
  "flows": "Text split -> enqueue fragments -> generate audio asynchronously -> schedule playback -> generate next fragment -> repeat until complete.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. External API calls are standard for TTS services.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a legitimate large-text-to-speech pipeline with proper resource management and no malicious activity. External communication via edge_tts is typical for cloud TTS. Temporary files are handled securely. No backdoors, obfuscation, or data leaks are evident. The structure and comments are clear, and the process aligns with standard practices. No vulnerabilities or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured implementation of asynchronous TTS processing with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The external API reliance is standard, and resource handling is appropriate. Overall, it poses minimal security risk.",
