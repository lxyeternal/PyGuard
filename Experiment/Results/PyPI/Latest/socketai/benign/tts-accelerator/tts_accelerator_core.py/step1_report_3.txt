'consumer' fetches each fragment, generates audio asynchronously via 'generate_audio', and plays it with 'play_audio'. Next fragment generation is scheduled concurrently, creating a source-to-sink flow from input text through audio generation to playback.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"Uses 'edge_tts' for TTS synthesis, which may communicate with external servers for voice synthesis; no explicit network code but implied data transmission. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code manages temporary files securely by deleting after use. The code's inline comment exaggerates performance claims (\"Ultra Optimised code!\") but this is not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious variable names detected. No code performs network operations directly, and no hidden backdoors are evident.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code splits input text into manageable fragments, then asynchronously generates speech audio for each fragment using edge_tts, which likely contacts external servers for speech synthesis. The audio data is read into memory and played via sounddevice. The use of temporary files is straightforward, with cleanup after reading. There are no signs of malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, system modification, or covert network activity. The only external communication appears to be through 'edge_tts' for text-to-speech conversion, which is standard for such services. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are detected. Overall, the code performs its intended function without malicious intent or security threats.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code functions as a large-text-to-speech converter with efficient asynchronous processing. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are identified. The external communication with 'edge_tts' is consistent with its use as an online TTS service. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks present in the code.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
