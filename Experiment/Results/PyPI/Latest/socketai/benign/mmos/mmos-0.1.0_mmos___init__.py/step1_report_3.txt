{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a part of an AI memory management system, organizing imports and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: memory_manager, models, vector_store",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform critical operations",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code mainly imports modules and sets metadata",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code structure is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes and modules, defines versioning info, and sets the public API. It does not perform data processing, input handling, or external communication. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks are present. The simplicity indicates standard module setup without hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It simply organizes and exports components for a larger AI memory management system.",
