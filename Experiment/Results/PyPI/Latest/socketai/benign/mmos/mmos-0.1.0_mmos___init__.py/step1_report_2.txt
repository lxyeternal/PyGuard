{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of an AI memory management system, likely providing modules for managing memory, models, and vector stores.",
  "sources": "The code imports components from local modules: memory_manager, models, and vector_store.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The code only imports modules; there are no data flows, input/output handling, or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a package by defining version info and exportable symbols, importing specific components from local modules. It contains no data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The simplicity and lack of dynamic code execution or external input handling suggest no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a Python package related to AI memory management. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
