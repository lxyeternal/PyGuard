  "purpose": "Define and export components for an AI memory management system.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from local files: memory_manager, models, vector_store.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows; no external network or file writing shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible as the code only contains imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer, importing specific classes from local files and setting module metadata. It does not process input data, execute untrusted code, or perform any operations that could lead to security risks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The code is minimal and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving solely for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely exports classes for external use without any suspicious or malicious code behavior.",
