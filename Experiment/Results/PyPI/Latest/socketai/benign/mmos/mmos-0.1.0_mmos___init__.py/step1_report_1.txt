{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be part of an AI memory management system, likely providing core classes for managing memory, memory objects, and vector storage.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: memory_manager, models, and vector_store",
  "sinks": "No evidence of data sinks that process untrusted input or untrusted data outputs",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and defines module-level exports; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard for module setup",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package __init__.py file setting up module imports and exports. It imports core classes from local modules and defines the package version and export list. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious patterns are present. There are no indications of malicious behavior or malicious code injection. The structure suggests a standard Python package initialization without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module initializer for an AI memory management system. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
