{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer (__init__.py) for an AI memory management system, importing core classes and defining module metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local module files: memory_manager, models, vector_store.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static module setup with no dynamic logic, input handling, or network activity. It imports classes from local modules and defines version and export variables. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The consistent reports correctly identify it as benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting its harmless nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initializer with no malicious intent or security concerns. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal security risk score of 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
