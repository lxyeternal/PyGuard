{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'mmos'.",
  "sources": "Reads package data such as README.md for long description, and specifies dependencies for installation.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform critical actions. No network, file, or system commands executed from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The script primarily defines metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() to read README.md without handling potential file access issues; no other suspicious or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input, network operations, or system modifications are present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are detected. The open() call on 'README.md' is typical for long description and does not pose security risks. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It performs standard operations without any malicious intent or security risks.",
