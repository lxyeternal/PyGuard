  "purpose": "Setuptools-based package configuration for the 'mmos' project, defining metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only performs package setup without executing untrusted code or data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical operations; setup parameters are static or sourced locally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. The email address appears placeholder but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup using setuptools. It reads a README.md file for long description, specifies dependencies, and defines package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or obfuscated code present. The use of placeholders like email and URL suggests a typical initial setup, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears legitimate and safe.",
