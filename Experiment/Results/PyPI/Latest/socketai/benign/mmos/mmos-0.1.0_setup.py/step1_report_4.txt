{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'mmos' Python project, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads project metadata (name, version, author, description, URL), reads the README.md file for long description, specifies dependencies in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup script primarily defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed. Usage of open() on a README file is standard in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools functions to define package metadata, dependencies, and packaging instructions. It reads the README.md for long description, which is typical. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, or suspicious patterns. Dependencies are specified plainly. No hardcoded credentials, no malicious code, and no obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for packaging purposes.",
