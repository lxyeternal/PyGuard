  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar setup.py scripts.\n- The code is a standard use of setuptools for packaging a Python project.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are reported.\n- The only potential concern is the use of `open(\"README.md\")` without error handling, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts and not inherently malicious.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or code injection is present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No, the code is straightforward and typical for a setup script.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  The only minor issue is the lack of error handling when opening \"README.md\". While not malicious, it could cause an exception if the file is missing. However, this is a common pattern and not a security concern.\n\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, risk)?**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, which seem appropriate given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is justified; no malicious activity is detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is justified; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified; no security risks are identified.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are all 1.0, which is appropriate given the clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed analysis, the initial scores are appropriate and justified. The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that files like \"README.md\" exist in the package source to prevent runtime errors, but this does not impact security assessments.",
