  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging the 'mmos' Python project, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements from setuptools, open() function to read README.md, function calls to setup() and find_packages()",
  "sinks": "The open() function reading 'README.md' could be a source if the file contains malicious content, but in this context it's benign; setup() parameters are primarily metadata",
  "flows": "The code reads 'README.md' content, then passes data to setup(), which processes package metadata and dependencies",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present; no use of dynamic execution or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file for description and specifies dependencies. No untrusted inputs or external code execution occurs. The dependencies listed are common and do not indicate malicious intent. The use of find_packages() is typical for package discovery. Overall, this appears to be legitimate package setup code without malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal setup configuration for a Python package. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies without any malicious logic or hidden features.",
