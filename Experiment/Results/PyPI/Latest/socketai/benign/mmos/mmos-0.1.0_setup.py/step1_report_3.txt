  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'mmos' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, author info, description, URL, and dependencies; loads README.md content.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data affects system or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads package info and dependencies; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read README.md without error handling is normal; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No external input handling or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears to be straightforward, with no obfuscated code, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard and legitimate use of setuptools for packaging.",
