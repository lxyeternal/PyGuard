  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, package metadata, dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "Reading local README.md file during setup; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without error handling; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, which is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The open() call is straightforward and common in such scripts, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. All dependencies are standard, and the code structure is clear and conventional. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified based on the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
