  "purpose": "A simple data model class for managing memory objects with attributes such as content, tags, metadata, importance, and access tracking.",
  "sources": "UUID generation for id, current time for timestamps, internal attribute assignments",
  "sinks": "None; no external data inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution",
  "flows": "Internal attribute assignments and method calls for updating access and importance",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Memory class with standard data attributes and methods for serialization/deserialization. It uses safe, standard libraries (uuid, time). No external inputs or network operations are present. The logic is straightforward, with proper encapsulation and data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is a benign data container with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured memory data model with no malicious or security concerns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are correctly set to 0, and confidence is high. The analysis aligns with the reports, confirming the benign nature of the code.",
