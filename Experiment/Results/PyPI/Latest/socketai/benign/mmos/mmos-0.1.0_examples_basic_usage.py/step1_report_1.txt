  "purpose": "Demonstrates the basic usage of the MemoryManager class from the mmos library for storing, retrieving, updating, and counting memories.",
  "sources": "Imports mmos.MemoryManager; calls methods store, retrieve, get_by_tags, update, count",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted input handling, no external data flows, no network or file operations",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data flow detected",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of a library API with no suspicious patterns or code execution",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single class from an external library and performs standard object instantiations and method calls to manage in-memory data. No input is read from external sources, no dynamic code execution, no use of environment variables, and no network activity or file access observed. The library appears to be used solely for managing data in a controlled manner. The code is straightforward and does not contain any obfuscated or malicious code. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign example demonstrating memory management functionalities from the mmos library. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activities are present.",
