  "purpose": "Demonstration of how to use the mmos MemoryManager for storing, retrieving, updating, and counting memories.",
  "sources": "Imports MemoryManager from the mmos package; calls store(), retrieve(), get_by_tags(), update(), count() methods.",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output retrieved memory contents and updates; no data sinks that handle untrusted input or output external systems.",
  "flows": "MemoryManager methods handle data internally; retrieval and update results are printed locally. No flow of untrusted data to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage appears standard for a memory management demonstration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a memory management library and performs typical operations such as storing data, retrieving it by content or tags, updating importance, and counting stored memories. No user input is accepted dynamically, and no network or system-level operations are performed. The code appears to be a straightforward example script. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The library's internal implementation is not shown; assuming it is a legitimate, benign package. The overall flow is consistent with a typical usage pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard example demonstrating the use of a memory management library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
