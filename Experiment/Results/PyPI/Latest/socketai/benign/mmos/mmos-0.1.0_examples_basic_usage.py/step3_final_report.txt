{
  "purpose": "Demonstration of using the MemoryManager library for storing, retrieving, updating, and counting memory entries.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals within the code, such as memory contents and tags.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows; no network, file, or environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "Data flows are internal and limited to in-memory operations; no external or untrusted data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static demonstration of the MemoryManager class. It performs typical in-memory data storage and retrieval without external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Given the lack of external data handling or vulnerabilities, the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward demonstration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
