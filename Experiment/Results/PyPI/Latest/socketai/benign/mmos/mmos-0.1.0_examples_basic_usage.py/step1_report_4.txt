  "purpose": "Demonstrate basic usage of the mmos MemoryManager library for storing, retrieving, updating, and counting memories.",
  "sources": "Code reads hardcoded strings and calls methods on the MemoryManager object.",
  "sinks": "Data is printed to standard output; no untrusted input or data leakage points evident.",
  "flows": "No external data flows; data is internally managed and only outputted via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a MemoryManager object, stores sample memories with tags and importance, retrieves memories based on keywords and tags, updates a memory's importance, and counts total memories. All data appears to be hardcoded for demonstration purposes. No user input, network access, or sensitive data handling is present. No malicious actions such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system manipulation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward demonstration of a memory management library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only manipulates internal data and outputs results locally.",
