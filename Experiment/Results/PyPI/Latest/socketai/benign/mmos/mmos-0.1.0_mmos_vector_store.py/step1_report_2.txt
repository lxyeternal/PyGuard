  "purpose": "A simple vector storage module for semantic search, storing and retrieving vectors associated with memories.",
  "sources": "Reads input from Memory objects (memory.content and memory.id), input query strings, and optional embedding_function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is used in a manner that leads to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Input data (memory.content and query) is processed via embedding_function to produce vectors, which are stored or compared; no external untrusted sources or sinks are identified.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a fixed random seed for vector generation when no embedding function is provided, which is benign; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for storing and retrieving vectors for semantic search. It initializes with optional embedding function, defaults to a mock embedding with deterministic pseudo-random vectors, and supports add, remove, update, clear, and search operations. The mock embedding function uses a fixed seed based on text hash, ensuring deterministic output. No external network calls, no handling of sensitive data, no code injection, no suspicious behaviors. The code relies solely on numpy for vector operations and handles data safely. Overall, the code appears to be a benign implementation of vector storage with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign vector storage implementation suitable for semantic search tasks. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It uses deterministic mock embeddings for testing purposes and does not interact with external systems beyond standard Python libraries.",
