{
  "purpose": "A simple vector storage module for semantic search, managing embeddings and similarity queries.",
  "sources": "Embedding function invocation, input parameters (texts, memory objects), hash for seed generation.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data directly leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input texts flow into embedding function; vectors stored in memory; similarity calculations based on stored vectors.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a fixed random seed (_rng.seed) per text, which could be suspicious if misused for predictable vector generation; otherwise standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for storing and retrieving vectors based on semantic similarity. It uses an optional embedding function or a mock embedding generator that produces consistent pseudo-random vectors based on text hashes, with normalization. No external network calls, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors are present. The mock embedding could potentially be misused for predictable vector outputs but is explicitly documented as a simulation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected. Overall, the code appears benign and straightforward, intended for semantic search tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a vector store for semantic search with no malicious intent. The use of mock embeddings is appropriate for testing and demonstration. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
