  "purpose": "A simple vector storage module for semantic search, supporting adding, updating, removing, and querying memory vectors.",
  "sources": "Embedding function invocation, memory.content input, memory.id input, hash for seed generation",
  "sinks": "np.random.RandomState.seed (used for pseudo-random vector generation), np.linalg.norm, np.dot for similarity calculation",
  "flows": "Input text (memory.content or query) -> embedding_function or _mock_embedding -> vector storage or similarity calculation",
  "anomalies": "Use of fixed seed in _mock_embedding for consistent pseudo-random vectors, no external network access, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or system calls",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward implementation of a vector store with mock embeddings using a fixed seed for reproducibility. It uses standard numpy functions and Python features. The embedding function defaults to a mock method if none is provided, which seeds the pseudo-random generator based on text hash to produce consistent vectors. No data leaks, no malicious code, nor external communications are present. The code is clean, well-structured, and appears to serve a benign purpose related to semantic search. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a vector store for semantic search with mock embedding capabilities. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
