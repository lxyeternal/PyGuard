{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of the mmos library for storing, searching, and updating user memories in a local, benign manner.",
  "sources": "Predefined string literals used in store() calls; internal method calls; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; no network communication, file I/O, or system commands; all data handled internally.",
  "flows": "Memory data flows from store() to vector_store.add_memory(), then retrieval via similarity_search() and get_by_id(), with updates via update() and update_memory().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward demonstration of in-memory storage, semantic search, and update operations using the mmos library. It uses hardcoded data with no external inputs, network activity, or system modifications. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present. The security risk is minimal, and malware suspicion is absent. The code's benign nature is consistent with the lack of external data handling or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of memory storage and retrieval, with no malicious activity or security risks. The security scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
