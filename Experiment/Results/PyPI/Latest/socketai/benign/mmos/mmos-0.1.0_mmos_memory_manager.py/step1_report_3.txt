  "purpose": "Memory management module for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting AI system memories, with optional persistent storage.",
  "sources": "Reads from file system during load_from_storage(), checks if storage path exists, and writes to file system in save_to_storage().",
  "sinks": "Writing data to storage path; reading data from storage path; accessing memory contents in retrieve, get_by_id, get_by_tags, and update methods.",
  "flows": "Data flows from storage (load_from_storage) into memory; from in-memory structures to storage (save_to_storage); and within methods from input parameters to memory objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard memory management system with in-memory storage and optional file-based persistence. Reads and writes are limited to local file system operations with standard JSON serialization/deserialization. The methods include typical CRUD operations with straightforward logic, and exception handling during file load. No code injection, network activity, or privacy-invasive behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns present. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a memory manager.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a memory management system with file persistence. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified. It operates solely on local data and file system, with no network activity or privacy violations.",
