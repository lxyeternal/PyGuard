  "purpose": "Memory management system for AI, handling storage, retrieval, update, and deletion of memories, with optional persistent storage.",
  "sources": "File reading for load_from_storage(), potential user inputs via function parameters (content, tags, metadata, query).",
  "sinks": "File writing in save_to_storage(), print statements for error logging.",
  "flows": "Data flows from storage files to memory objects during load; from memory objects to storage files during save; user input to memory storage and retrieval functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution; print statements for error reporting are typical. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a MemoryManager class that manages Memory objects, providing methods for storing, retrieving, updating, deleting, and persisting memories. Storage is via JSON files, with load and save functions. No user input is executed as code, and data is only written to files and printed for errors. No network activity, reverse shells, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a memory system with persistent storage, without any malicious or sabotage elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a memory management module with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles data safely within its scope, with standard file I/O and error handling. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or security risks beyond typical application behavior.",
