  "purpose": "Configuration management for the system, including loading defaults, environment variable overrides, YAML file reading, and saving configurations.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'rtaspi_CONFIG', configuration YAML file on disk, internal default configuration dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Reading environment variables, checking file existence, loading YAML configuration, saving configuration to disk.",
  "flows": "Environment variable -> config_path; File existence check -> YAML load -> _update_dict merges loaded config into defaults -> save_config writes to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity. Placeholders for sensitive data are benign defaults.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration handler that loads default settings, optionally merges user configurations from a YAML file, and allows runtime get/set modifications. It uses safe YAML parsing and proper error handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The environment variable and file I/O are standard practices. Default placeholders for secrets are not malicious but could be misused if misconfigured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing standard configuration management with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk mainly due to default placeholders but no active threats.",
