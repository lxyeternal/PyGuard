{
  "purpose": "Entry point for the rtaspi module, intended to run the application from the command line.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, command line arguments, and potentially subprocess outputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential subprocess execution, traceback handling, and data output through JSON or other means.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv or environment variables may be used in subprocess calls or processed and outputted as JSON.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements and comments; no actual functional code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is only the initial part of a Python module with import statements, comments, and a shebang. No data processing, input reading, or output is shown. Without further code, there are no active source or sink points, nor evidence of malicious activity. The imported modules include re, sys, os, json, subprocess, traceback, and typing, all standard and safe. The comments indicate it is a CLI entry point, but no executable logic is present to evaluate further.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. This appears to be a standard entry point setup with no suspicious activities.",
