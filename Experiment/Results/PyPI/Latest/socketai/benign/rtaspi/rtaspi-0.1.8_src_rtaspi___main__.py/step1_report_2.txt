  "purpose": "Entry point for the rtaspi module, allowing it to be run as a command-line application.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules: re, sys, os, json, subprocess, traceback, and typing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified in the provided code segment.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified; code is primarily imports with no further logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code contains only import statements and initial comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is an initial setup for a Python module, including documentation comments, shebang, and imports. There are no functions, classes, or executable statements that could be malicious or pose security risks. The imported modules are standard and widely used. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors is evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a benign module entry point with no signs of malicious behavior. It only contains documentation and import statements, with no dangerous operations present.",
