  "purpose": "Module entry point with descriptive comments and import statements for rtaspi.",
  "sources": "Import statements: re, sys, os, json, subprocess, traceback, typing",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code contains only imports and comments, no data flows or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "No data flows; no executable logic present",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, functions, or data processing; only comments and imports",
  "analysis": "The code snippet consists solely of comments, shebang, and import statements with no executable logic. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are present. The code is a standard module entry point template, with no data flows or vulnerabilities. The lack of executable code means no attack vectors or malicious activity can be inferred. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only structural comments and imports. No malicious behavior or security issues are present. The current assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
