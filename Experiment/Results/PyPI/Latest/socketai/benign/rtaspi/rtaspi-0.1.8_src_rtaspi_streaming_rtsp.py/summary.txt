  "security_risk": 0.2,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The source code is legitimate, purpose-driven, and free of malicious behavior or sabotage. It implements standard media streaming functions with appropriate process and port management. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is justified by the inherent risks of subprocess and network port handling but remains low given the confined, local operation. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in production environments with standard security practices."
