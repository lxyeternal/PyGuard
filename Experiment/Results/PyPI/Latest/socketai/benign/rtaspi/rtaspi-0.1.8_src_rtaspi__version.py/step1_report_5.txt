  "purpose": "Provide version information for the rtaspi package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string to __version__ and version variables, return statement in get_version() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output, no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "The function returns a hardcoded version string; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, no unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to two variables and provides a simple function to return that version. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external data sources, and no output manipulation that could lead to security issues. The code appears to be a standard version declaration with a getter function. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to store and retrieve version information for the package. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
