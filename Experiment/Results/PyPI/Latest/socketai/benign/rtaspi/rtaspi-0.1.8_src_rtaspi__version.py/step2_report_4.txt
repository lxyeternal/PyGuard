  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a simple, static version information provider.\n- It assigns a version string to variables and provides a getter function.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external data flows.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, straightforward, with no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Also correctly states the code is benign, with no external inputs or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Same as above; straightforward version declaration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous; no external data, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same as others; standard version info code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final considerations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- Since the code is extremely simple and static, scores are appropriate.\n- No evidence suggests higher risk or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. No modifications are necessary.",
