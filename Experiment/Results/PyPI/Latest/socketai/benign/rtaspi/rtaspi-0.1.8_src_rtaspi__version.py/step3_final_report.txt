  "purpose": "Provides version information for the rtaspi package.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of __version__ and version variables.",
  "sinks": "Return statement in get_version() function.",
  "flows": "From __version__ variable to return in get_version().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a fixed version string to __version__ and version variables, and the get_version() function returns this static value. There are no inputs, external data, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal, correct, and serves solely to provide version info. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static version string provider with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
