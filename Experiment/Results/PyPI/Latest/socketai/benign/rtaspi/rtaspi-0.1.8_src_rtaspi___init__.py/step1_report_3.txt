  "purpose": "Provides metadata and description for the 'rtaspi' library, which offers tools for creating safe voice AI applications for children with parental controls and local processing.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward documentation and metadata initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments describing the library's purpose and metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __email__). No functions, data processing, input/output operations, or external interactions are present. It does not contain suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or secret operations. As such, there are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
