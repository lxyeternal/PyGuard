  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely metadata: comments and variable assignments (__version__, __author__, __email__).\n   - There is no executable code, no data flow, no input/output, and no dynamic behavior.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign and only contains descriptive metadata.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are apparent in the analysis.\n   - The assessments appropriately assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, given the nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n   - Since the code is just metadata, these scores should remain as is.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a risk score above 0.5. The code is purely documentation, with no executable or malicious elements.\n   - Therefore, the risk scores should stay at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is correctly assigned as 0 in all reports.\n   - There is no malicious activity or code present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward observations: no code execution, no external interactions, no obfuscation.\n   - No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is purely metadata with no executable or suspicious content. It is standard documentation for a Python module. There are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation involved.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores.\n- The code poses no security threat.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Maintain all scores at 0.\n- No further action required.",
