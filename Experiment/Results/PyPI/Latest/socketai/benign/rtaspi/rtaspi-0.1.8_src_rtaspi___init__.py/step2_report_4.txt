  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __email__) and descriptive comments about the library's purpose.\n   - There is no executable code, data processing, input/output, or dynamic behavior.\n   - No functions, external interactions, or code that could be exploited or used maliciously.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly conclude that the code is benign, metadata-only, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - No flaws or errors are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the content.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely metadata with no executable or dynamic content, the **risk score** should be **0**.\n   - The **malware score** should also be **0**, as there is no malicious activity or intent.\n   - The **obfuscated score** is correctly **0** because there's no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the code's static, benign nature.\n   - They correctly identify that the code does not pose any security threat.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Content:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward module header with descriptive comments and metadata variables. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign.\n\n**Note:** No changes needed; the current evaluation aligns perfectly with the code content.",
