  "purpose": "Metadata and descriptive comments defining the package version, author, and contact information for a Python library.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments (__version__, __author__, __email__) and comments describing the library's purpose.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external input handling present; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow or dynamic execution; static metadata with no source-to-sink pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, dynamic behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments and comments, with no functions, data processing, or external interactions. All reviews correctly identify the code as metadata-only, benign, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the content. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code poses no security threat and is purely informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign metadata with no malicious or suspicious content. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, documentation-only nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
