  "purpose": "Documentation and metadata declaration for the rtaspi library, describing its function as a safe voice AI interface for children with parental controls and local processing.",
  "sources": "Module-level string comments and variable assignments (__version__, __author__, __email__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static metadata declarations",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns; only metadata definitions and descriptive comments",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains only descriptive comments about the library's purpose and metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __email__). No executable code, data input/output, or dynamic behavior is present. This suggests it functions solely as a module metadata declaration without any logic or external interactions. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, nor any indicators of security risks or malware. The comments are straightforward and describe the library's purpose for creating safe AI voice applications for children.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata and comments without any executable or malicious content. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior, serving only as descriptive documentation.",
