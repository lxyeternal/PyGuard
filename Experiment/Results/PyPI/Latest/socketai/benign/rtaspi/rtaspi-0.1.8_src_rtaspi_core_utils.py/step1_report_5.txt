{
  "purpose": "Utility script for system information retrieval and dependency checking, including version detection and environment setup.",
  "sources": "Socket connections for IP, UUID module for MAC address, subprocess calls for version info, file I/O for JSON data.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes untrusted data to sensitive outputs or transmits data externally.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows into security-critical sinks; system info and command outputs are retrieved locally without external transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors identified. Functions perform standard system checks and data retrieval. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs system diagnostics: collecting system info, verifying dependencies like ffmpeg, gstreamer, nginx, and handling JSON files. All subprocess calls are for version checks and are properly handled. No data is transmitted over the network, no code injection points are evident, and no sensitive data is stored insecurely. Logging is used for warnings but does not leak sensitive data. No hidden backdoors or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for system diagnostics and configuration checks. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malware. All functions serve standard purposes related to environment verification and data handling with appropriate safeguards.",
