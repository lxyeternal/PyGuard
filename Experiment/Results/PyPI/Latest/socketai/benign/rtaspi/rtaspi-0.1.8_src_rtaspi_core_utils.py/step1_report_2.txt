{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for system information gathering and dependency checks for multimedia tools and web servers, as well as file management.",
  "sources": "Function calls to system commands (e.g., subprocess.run with 'ffmpeg', 'gst-launch-1.0', 'nginx'), reading environment and system info, uuid generation, file read/write operations.",
  "sinks": "Writing JSON files to disk, executing system commands, network operations indirectly through subprocess, but no explicit network data transmission in this code.",
  "flows": "System commands (sources) are executed, and their outputs are processed and stored locally; no flow of untrusted external input to sensitive functions or data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Logging warnings for missing dependencies are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily gathers system info, checks for the presence and versions of external tools (ffmpeg, gstreamer, nginx), and handles file operations. It uses subprocess calls securely with limited data processing. No indications of malicious payloads or covert channels. No external network transmissions or data leaks are present. All command outputs are processed locally. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility code intended for system environment assessment and file management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on this review.",
