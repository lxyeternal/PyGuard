  "purpose": "Utility module for system information retrieval and dependency checks for media processing tools.",
  "sources": "socket, subprocess, uuid, os, sys, psutil, platform, shutil, pathlib, json, time",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() calls executing system commands (ffmpeg, gst-launch-1.0, nginx), file operations (write_json, read_json)",
  "flows": "Code reads system info and command availability, then potentially executes system commands to gather version info and plugins; data is stored or retrieved via JSON files",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. No obfuscated code or hidden functionalities detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily collects system data and checks for the presence and versions of media processing tools (ffmpeg, gstreamer, nginx). It executes system commands to retrieve version info and plugin lists, then processes and stores this data in JSON files. All subprocess calls are straightforward version checks or plugin enumerations, with no evident data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code uses standard Python libraries and well-known command-line tools, and there are no suspicious network communications or hidden features.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for system and dependency monitoring, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It gathers system and software info for operational purposes only.",
