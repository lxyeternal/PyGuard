  "purpose": "System utility module for gathering system info, checking dependencies (ffmpeg, gstreamer, nginx), and managing JSON files.",
  "sources": "System commands for version info and plugin enumeration, file I/O for JSON data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or network transmissions; subprocess calls are for benign version checks.",
  "flows": "Source commands execute system info retrieval; data stored or read from JSON files; no external data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard system diagnostics using subprocess calls, file operations, and system info collection. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or covert data exfiltration is present. All subprocess executions are for version checks or plugin enumeration, which are safe. No external network communication occurs beyond these commands. Exception handling is standard and does not indicate malicious activity. The overall behavior aligns with legitimate system utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, legitimate system utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
