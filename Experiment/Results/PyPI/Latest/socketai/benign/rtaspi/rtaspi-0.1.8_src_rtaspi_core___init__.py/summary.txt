  "obfuscated": 0.25,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The assessments are generally reasonable and conservative. Slightly increasing malware scores for reports 3 and 5 to around 0.4 enhances accuracy, considering the suspicious patterns. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears low risk but warrants ongoing vigilance, especially regarding obfuscation and dynamic code features."
