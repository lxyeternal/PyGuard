  "purpose": "Setup script for installing the rtaspi package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, reading version information from src/rtaspi/_version.py",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks observed",
  "flows": "Reading files (README.md, _version.py) to set up package metadata",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard setup script structure",
  "analysis": "The script loads package description and version info from files, then calls setup() with metadata. The file handling is straightforward, using safe methods. No dynamic code execution (beyond exec for version) that poses security risks, and the exec is confined to version assignment from a known file. No network connections, no handling of untrusted input, and no malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads package metadata from files and performs configuration accordingly.",
