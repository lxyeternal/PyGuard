  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script reading README.md and _version.py.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks; straightforward file reads and exec for version.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or malicious activity. The exec() is confined to _version.py, which is a common practice.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard setup script.\n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe file reading and standard practices.\n- No signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also confirms standard setup procedures with safe file handling.\n- No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion: standard setup, safe practices, no malicious activity.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still no indication of issues.\n- **Malware:** 0, **Obfuscated:** 0, **SecurityRisk:** 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, confirms safe, standard setup code.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** The code is a typical `setup.py` script. It reads static files for description and version info, then calls `setuptools.setup()`. The only dynamic execution is `exec()` on `_version.py`, which is a common pattern for managing version info. There's no network activity, no handling of untrusted input, no obfuscated code, no secrets, credentials, or malicious logic.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware or obfuscation. The `exec()` call is standard in setup scripts for versioning, assuming `_version.py` is safe. No malicious code or behavior is evident.\n\n- **Security Risks:** The script is read-only regarding local files, with no external data or network activity. It performs package setup, which is inherently safe.\n\n- **Scores & Justification:**\n  - **Malware score:** 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n  - **Risk score:** 0, the script is standard and safe.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- The code is a straightforward, standard Python package setup script.\n- All reports are consistent and confirm no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The use of `exec()` on `_version.py` is common and acceptable if `_version.py` is trusted, which appears to be the case here.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments. No changes needed.**",
