  "purpose": "Setup script for installing the rtaspi Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description, reads version from src/rtaspi/_version.py.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reads description and version data from files, then passes metadata to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic present. No malicious or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures: reading a README file for long description, executing a version file to get package version, and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata. File reading operations use safe methods, and no user input or untrusted data handling is present. No dynamic code execution beyond executing a version file, which is typical for such setup scripts. No network calls, data leaks, or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely reads necessary data and configures package installation without any suspicious activity.",
