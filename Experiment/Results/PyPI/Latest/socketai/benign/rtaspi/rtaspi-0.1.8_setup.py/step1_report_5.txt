{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the installation configuration for the 'rtaspi' Python package, including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; executing the _version.py file to get version info",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is directly used in a sink that could cause harm or leak data",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content to populate long_description; executing _version.py to set version variable",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard setup.py installation logic, no hardcoded credentials or secret data",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup process for a Python package. It safely reads the README file with proper encoding and handles FileNotFoundError gracefully. The version is retrieved via exec() on _version.py, which is common practice but requires assurance that _version.py is safe and not malicious. All package metadata appears legitimate. No dynamic code execution or external network calls are present. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It performs expected package installation tasks safely.",
