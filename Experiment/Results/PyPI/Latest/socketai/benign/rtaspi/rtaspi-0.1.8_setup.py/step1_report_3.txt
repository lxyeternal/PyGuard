{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the rtaspi package, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, reading the version information from src/rtaspi/_version.py.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data is processed or sent.",
  "flows": "Read README.md -> store in LONG_DESCRIPTION; Read _version.py -> execute to obtain version info; then setup() is called with static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard setup operations with no suspicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for a Python package. It reads a README.md file for description and dynamically loads the version from a source file. The setup() function is called with static package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions beyond loading version info, no network activity, no handling of untrusted input, and no secret or credentials embedded. The code adheres to common practices for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It performs expected package installation configuration tasks without involving any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
