  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the rtaspi Python module, reading README.md and version info, then configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, executing _version.py to obtain version info",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data handling",
  "flows": "File reads for README.md and _version.py; exec() on _version.py to load version; setup() call with static metadata",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on _version.py, which is common but depends on the trustworthiness of _version.py; no other anomalies",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with safe file reads and version loading. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The exec() call is standard for version management but relies on _version.py being safe. No network activity, secrets, or obfuscation detected. All signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package setup file with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of exec() is acceptable if _version.py is trusted. No evidence of malware or obfuscation; overall security risk is negligible.",
