  "purpose": "Setup script for installing the rtaspi Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, reading _version.py for version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulation beyond reading static files.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md to set LONG_DESCRIPTION, executing _version.py to get version info, then passing data to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code constructs. No dynamic code execution other than executing _version.py, which is a standard practice for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures: reading a README file for description, executing a version file to obtain the version, and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata. The reading of external files is straightforward and safe. The execution of _version.py is typical in setup scripts to obtain version info. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or malicious logic. All operations are standard for a package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and standard. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are detected.",
