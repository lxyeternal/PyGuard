  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing and possibly network communication, but the exact purpose is unclear due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or external data files (if present). No explicit sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Network connection calls, file write/read operations, or system commands could act as sinks if present. No explicit sinks are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input or environment sources to processing functions, and potentially to network or file outputs. No explicit flow paths are identified in the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are visible. Lack of context limits detection.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, but without specific code content provided, no malicious or suspicious patterns are detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No signs of obfuscation or malware code. The structure and format are typical of standard Python scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet and the absence of suspicious elements, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. However, due to lack of detailed code, this assessment is made with low confidence.",
