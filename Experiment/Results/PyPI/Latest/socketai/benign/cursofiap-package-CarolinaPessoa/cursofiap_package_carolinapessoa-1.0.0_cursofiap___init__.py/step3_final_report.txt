  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code analysis, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious indicators.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network connections, file reads, user inputs, external libraries, and data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, system commands, database queries, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as data inputs or environment variables to sinks like network connections or file writes, indicating potential malicious data exfiltration or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is absent or minimal in all reports, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors identified. Confidence levels vary based on the amount of code reviewed, with higher confidence in benign assessments. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious functions are detected. The security risk scores are low, reflecting minimal threat, and malware scores are zero, indicating no malicious intent. The assessments are consistent with the provided summaries and code context.",
  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious or suspicious code, with appropriate scoring. The low malware and obfuscation scores align with the benign nature of the code, and the low security risk scores reflect cautious but justified assessments given limited code context.",
