  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads a README.md for long description and defines package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file; static parameters in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no data leaks or malicious effects",
  "flows": "Static file read; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'url' field, which is incomplete but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious behavior. It reads a static file and calls setup() with fixed parameters. No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The only anomaly is the empty 'url' field, which does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security issues. All signals indicate a safe setup script.",
