  "flows": "Reading file content into 'long_description', used in setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'url' parameter, but no malicious intent; no suspicious code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It reads a markdown file for description and calls 'setup()' with package metadata. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or suspicious patterns observed. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a typical configuration file for distributing a Python package.",
