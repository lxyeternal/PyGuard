  "purpose": "This script configures the packaging and distribution of a Python library, including reading a README file for long description.",
  "sources": "Reads content from 'README.md' file to set 'long_description'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows leading to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Input source (README.md) used only for setting a description; no data flows to sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard 'setuptools' functions for package setup. It reads the README.md file safely and populates setup parameters. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling are observed. The URL field is empty, which is typical when not yet published or intentionally left blank. No suspicious or malicious code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and follows standard practices. There is no indication of malware or security risks.",
