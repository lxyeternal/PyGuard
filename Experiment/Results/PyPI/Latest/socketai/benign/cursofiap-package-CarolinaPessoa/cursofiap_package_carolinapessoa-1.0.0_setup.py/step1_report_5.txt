  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging a Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setuptools modules, package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md file, then passing parameters to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Empty URL field; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README.md file to include as long description, then calls setup() with package metadata. No user input, no network activity, and no sensitive data handling are observed. The code appears to be standard for Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code. The only minor anomaly is the empty URL field, which may be incomplete but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior. It performs basic package configuration without any suspicious or harmful code.",
