  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package, specifying metadata and reading a README file for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that process untrusted data; setup parameters are static.",
  "flows": "File read operation to load long_description; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code. 'url' field is empty but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata and reads a markdown file for description. No input validation, external data processing, or suspicious code features are present. The empty 'url' field may indicate incomplete configuration but is not malicious. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It primarily handles static configuration and file reading without processing untrusted data.",
