  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static greeting string with no external inputs or network activity.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external data or inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or send data to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function is static and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that returns a fixed string. All reports confirm the absence of external data handling, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature. No anomalies or security concerns are present. The assessments are accurate and well-justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores reflect this. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
