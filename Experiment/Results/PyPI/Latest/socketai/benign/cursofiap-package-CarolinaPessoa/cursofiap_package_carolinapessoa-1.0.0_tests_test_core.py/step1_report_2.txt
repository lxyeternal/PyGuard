{
  "purpose": "The code is a test script using pytest to verify the output of the 'hello_world' function from the 'cursofiap.core' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, file paths, and module imports; specifically, it uses 'sys.path.insert', 'os.path' functions, and imports 'pytest' and 'sys'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send data over the network, write to files, or perform any actions that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "The code adds a directory to the system path, then imports a function and tests its output; no untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward test code with standard imports and a simple assertion.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up the environment by modifying sys.path, imports testing libraries, and a module function. It then defines a test case that asserts the output of 'hello_world' equals a specific string. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activities. The code appears to be a legitimate test script for verifying a function’s output.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test script for a simple function and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe based on the provided content.",
