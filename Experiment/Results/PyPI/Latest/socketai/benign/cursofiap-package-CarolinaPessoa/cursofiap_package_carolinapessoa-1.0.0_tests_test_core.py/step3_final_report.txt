{
  "purpose": "A simple pytest unit test for the function 'hello_world()' from the 'cursofiap.core' module, verifying it returns 'Hello, world!'.",
  "sources": "sys.path modification to include parent directories; import statement for 'hello_world'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external output, or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Importing 'hello_world' after modifying sys.path; calling 'hello_world()' and asserting its output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.path.insert to modify module search path, which is common in test setups but could be viewed as unusual outside testing contexts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The sys.path modification is typical in testing environments and does not introduce security risks. No external data, network activity, or sensitive data handling is involved. The code's simplicity and purpose are clear, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing the 'hello_world()' function, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
