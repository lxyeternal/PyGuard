{
  "purpose": "Unit testing the 'hello_world' function from the 'cursofiap.core' module.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'sys', 'os', and 'pytest' modules, as well as the 'hello_world' function from a relative path.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "The test calls 'hello_world()' and asserts its return value; no data flow from external sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; use of 'sys.path.insert' to modify the module search path is common in testing but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing and system modules, adjusts the Python module search path to include a parent directory, and tests a function for expected output. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or suspicious code activity. The only noteworthy aspect is the dynamic modification of 'sys.path' for testing purposes, which is a common pattern in test environments but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward unit test without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a normal test script for verifying the output of a function. No malicious intent or security issues detected.",
