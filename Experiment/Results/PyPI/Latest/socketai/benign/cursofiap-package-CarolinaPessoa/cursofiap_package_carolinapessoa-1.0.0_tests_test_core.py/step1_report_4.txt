{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test script for verifying the output of the 'hello_world' function from the 'cursofiap.core' module.",
  "sources": "Reading the module 'cursofiap.core' and its 'hello_world' function; reading the current file's directory and manipulating sys.path.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct data sinks; it only asserts a string output.",
  "flows": "Importing 'hello_world' and calling it in the test; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns; use of sys.path manipulation is common in test setups but could be considered as a minor anomaly if used maliciously. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up the environment to import a module from a parent directory, then runs a simple pytest test to verify the output of 'hello_world'. The code is straightforward and standard for unit testing. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior is present. No anomalies or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for a simple function, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities.",
