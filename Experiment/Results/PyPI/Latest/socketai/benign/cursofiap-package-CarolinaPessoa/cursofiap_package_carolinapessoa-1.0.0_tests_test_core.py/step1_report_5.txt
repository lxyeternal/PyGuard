{
  "purpose": "Unit testing the hello_world function from the cursofiap.core module.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, os, and pytest; modification of sys.path to include parent directories; importing hello_world function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data handling or external outputs; no external network or sensitive data access.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code simply calls a function and asserts its output.",
  "anomalies": "The sys.path modification is unusual but common in test setups; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a testing environment by modifying sys.path to include parent directories, then imports pytest and a function from a local module. The test function asserts that hello_world() returns 'Hello, world!'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The setup appears standard for local testing, with no suspicious patterns or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test with no malicious intent or security issues detected. The sys.path modification is typical for test environments and does not indicate malicious behavior.",
