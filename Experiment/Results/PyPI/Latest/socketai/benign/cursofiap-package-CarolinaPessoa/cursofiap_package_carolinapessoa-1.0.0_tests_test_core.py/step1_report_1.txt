  "purpose": "Unit testing the hello_world function from the cursofiap.core module.",
  "sources": "Reading the hello_world function from the imported module.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; test assertion is static.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; use of sys.path modification is common for test setups but can be considered unusual if unnecessary.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing libraries and modifies sys.path to include parent directories, likely for module import purposes. It then tests the output of hello_world() against a fixed string. No dynamic input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain attack mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign test script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. The code primarily facilitates testing a simple function without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
