  "conclusion": "The code is primarily an information-gathering tool with potential for misuse due to hardcoded credentials. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The security risk is moderate, mainly because of credential exposure, but no malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned are appropriate; a slight increase in overall risk to around 0.6 is justified to reflect the security concern."
