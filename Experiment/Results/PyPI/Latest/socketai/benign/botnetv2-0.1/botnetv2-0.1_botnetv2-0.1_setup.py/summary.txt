  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign and standard. The primary concern is the package name 'botnetv2', which suggests potential malicious intent if the module contains harmful code. Without inspecting the 'botnetv2' module, the scores should reflect no malicious code (malware=0), no obfuscation (obfuscated=0), and a moderate security risk (~0.3-0.4) due to naming suspicion. Caution is advised if the module's content is malicious, but the setup script itself is safe."
