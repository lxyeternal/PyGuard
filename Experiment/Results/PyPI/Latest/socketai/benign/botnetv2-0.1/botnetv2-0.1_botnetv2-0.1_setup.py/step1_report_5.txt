{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to package and distribute a Python project named 'botnetv2'. It defines package metadata and entry points for command-line execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package information and entry point configuration; no external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the script simply sets up package configuration and entry points.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'botnetv2' is suspicious and potentially malicious. The name suggests malicious intent, but the code itself does not include malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and CLI entry points. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious code constructs are present. The main concern is the package name, which is unusual and suggests potentially malicious or harmful intent if distributed publicly, but the script content itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no embedded malicious behavior. The primary concern is the package name 'botnetv2', which indicates potential malicious purpose, but the script itself is harmless.",
