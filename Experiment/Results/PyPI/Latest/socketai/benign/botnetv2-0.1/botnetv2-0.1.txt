      "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign and standard. The primary concern is the package name 'botnetv2', which suggests potential malicious intent if the module contains harmful code. Without inspecting the 'botnetv2' module, the scores should reflect no malicious code (malware=0), no obfuscation (obfuscated=0), and a moderate security risk (~0.3-0.4) due to naming suspicion. Caution is advised if the module's content is malicious, but the setup script itself is safe."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily an information-gathering tool with potential for misuse due to hardcoded credentials. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The security risk is moderate, mainly because of credential exposure, but no malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned are appropriate; a slight increase in overall risk to around 0.6 is justified to reflect the security concern."
