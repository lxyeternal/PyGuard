{
  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'dkrlog'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, author info, description, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data sinks are present; the script only defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "The static data flows from the setup() call into the package metadata; no external or dynamic data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The dependencies are common packages without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for Python packaging using setuptools. It specifies package details and dependencies with no dynamic or malicious code. There are no sources of untrusted input, no code execution, and no suspicious data flows or anomalies. The dependencies are standard open-source packages and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, this appears to be a benign, typical setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies.",
