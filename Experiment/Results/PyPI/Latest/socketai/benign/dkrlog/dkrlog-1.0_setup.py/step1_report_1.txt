{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'dkrlog' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata fields (name, version, author, description, dependencies) and imports from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations beyond static import and configuration.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the script simply passes static parameters to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with static arguments defining package metadata and dependencies. All data are hardcoded and standard for Python package configuration. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution occurs. The dependencies listed are common Python packages. The code does not contain any suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious intent, anomalies, or security risks.",
