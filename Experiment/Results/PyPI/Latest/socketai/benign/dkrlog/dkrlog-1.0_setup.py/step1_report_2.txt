  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'dkrlog' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata (name, version, author, email, description, requirements, classifiers, python version).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows; static configuration data is assigned directly to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static metadata about the package. No input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, and no data leaks are observed. The requirements are standard dependencies. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard configuration for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use.",
