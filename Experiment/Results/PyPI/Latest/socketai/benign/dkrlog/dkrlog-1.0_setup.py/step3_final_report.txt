  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for Python package distribution.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, author, author_email, description, install_requires, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or dynamic input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; dependencies are common packages.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools with static, hardcoded metadata and dependencies. It contains no dynamic input, network operations, code execution, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign, straightforward nature of the code. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the static, non-malicious content. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
