  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, the code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk scores are appropriately low, and malware/obfuscated scores are zero. Given the absence of actual code, these assessments are tentative but justified. For future evaluations, access to actual code snippets is recommended to refine the analysis."
