  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "No code provided; analysis based on summaries and descriptions of behavior.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows towards network or file operations, environment variables, or input handling.",
  "flows": "Data potentially flows from input sources (environment variables, user input) to sinks like network or file systems, but no concrete code provided to confirm.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code prevents detection of anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets, limiting detailed analysis. The assessments correctly assign low malware and obfuscation scores due to no evidence. Risk scores are conservatively set around 0.2, reflecting minimal concern given the limited information. Confidence levels are moderate to low, appropriate for incomplete data. No suspicious behaviors or malicious indicators are observed or inferred from summaries.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, the code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk scores are appropriately low, and malware/obfuscated scores are zero. Given the absence of actual code, these assessments are tentative but justified. For future evaluations, access to actual code snippets is recommended to refine the analysis.",
