{
  "purpose": "The code loads a CSV dataset, filters and renames columns, then plots a time series using an imported utility function.",
  "sources": "Reads data from '../data/aus_production.csv' via pandas.read_csv.",
  "sinks": "Calls plot_series with the processed DataFrame; no other data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Data is read from CSV, filtered/renamed, then passed to plot_series; no untrusted input flows to sensitive sinks beyond visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The CSV path is relative but not malicious. The imported function 'plot_series' is from a local module, which appears benign based on available info.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pandas, reads a CSV file, filters data from the year 2000 onwards, inserts a constant 'unique_id' column, renames a column, and calls a plotting function. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. The code's structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated elements. The only potential concern is reliance on a local module 'fpppy.utils', but its function name 'plot_series' suggests benign visualization. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data loading, processing, and visualization without any evidence of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be standard data analysis code with no supply chain threats.",
