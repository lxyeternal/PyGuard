  "purpose": "The code reads a CSV file, filters and renames data, then calls an external plotting function to visualize the data.",
  "sources": "pd.read_csv(\"../data/aus_production.csv\") to read data from a CSV file.",
  "sinks": "plot_series(ausbeer2) which may display or process the data visually.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV reading (source), through filtering and renaming, into the plotting function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code imports and uses standard libraries and functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pandas and a local utility function 'plot_series'. It reads a CSV file relative to the script's location, filters the data to dates after 2000-01-01, renames columns, and passes the prepared DataFrame to the plotting function. No suspicious code, external network connections, or data exfiltration methods are present. The plotting function is external and not included, but assuming it is a standard visualization, no malicious behavior is indicated.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing typical data processing and visualization tasks without any malicious intent or security risks.",
