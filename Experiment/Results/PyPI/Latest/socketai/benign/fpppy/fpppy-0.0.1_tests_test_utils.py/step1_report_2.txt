{
  "purpose": "The code reads a CSV file containing production data, filters it for dates after 2000-01-01, prepares the data, and then calls a plotting function to visualize it.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a CSV file located at '../data/aus_production.csv'.",
  "sinks": "The code calls the 'plot_series' function from the 'fpppy.utils' module, which may generate a plot.",
  "flows": "Data is read from the CSV file ('pd.read_csv') → filtered/query operation ('aus_production.query') → data manipulation ('insert', 'rename') → passed to 'plot_series' for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or unusual code constructs are present. The code imports only pandas and a local utility for plotting. No signs of obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing steps: reading a CSV, filtering data by date, renaming columns, and plotting. The file path is relative, which could be a concern if untrusted data is in that location, but no malicious input or code injection is present. The plot_series function's implementation is not shown, so potential malicious behavior there cannot be assessed, but in this context, it appears to be a benign utility. There are no suspicious operations, backdoors, or data exfiltration attempts detected within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data processing and visualization script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended for data analysis purposes.",
