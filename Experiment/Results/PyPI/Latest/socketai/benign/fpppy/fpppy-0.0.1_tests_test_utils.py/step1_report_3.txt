  "purpose": "The code reads a CSV file containing production data, filters it for dates after 2000-01-01, modifies the DataFrame, and then plots the data using a plotting utility.",
  "sources": "pd.read_csv('../data/aus_production.csv', parse_dates=['ds'])",
  "sinks": "plot_series(ausbeer2)",
  "flows": "read_csv -> filter query -> insert/rename columns -> plot_series",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward data loading and manipulation sequence: it reads a CSV file, filters data based on date, modifies DataFrame columns, and then calls a plotting function. The CSV file path is relative but does not contain any embedded secrets. The plot_series function is imported locally and called with the processed DataFrame. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. The code structure is typical for data analysis tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and performs standard data processing and plotting tasks without any malicious intent. No security concerns or malicious behaviors are evident based on this code fragment.",
