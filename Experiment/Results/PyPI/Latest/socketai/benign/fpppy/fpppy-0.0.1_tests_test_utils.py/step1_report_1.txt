{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to load a CSV file containing Australian beer production data, filter it for dates after 2000, modify the data frame, and then plot the series using a utility function.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a CSV file at '../data/aus_production.csv'.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'plot_series' from the 'fpppy.utils' module, which may generate visual output based on the data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the CSV (source) into filtering and modifying the DataFrame, then into the plotting function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The import statement is local, and the data loading appears standard. No evidence of obfuscated code or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pandas for data manipulation and defines a test function that imports a plotting utility. It reads a CSV file containing production data, filters records from 2000 onwards, modifies the DataFrame by adding a 'unique_id' column and renaming columns, then plots the data. There are no external data injections, command executions, or network communications. The code appears to perform legitimate data processing and visualization tasks, with no signs of malicious activity or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data loading and plotting routine with no malicious intent detected. It reads data, processes it, and visualizes it safely. No security risks or malware signals are identified.",
