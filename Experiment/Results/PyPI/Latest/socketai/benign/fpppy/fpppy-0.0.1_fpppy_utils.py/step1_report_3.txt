{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for plotting time series data, stacked series, and diagnostics such as residuals, autocorrelation, and histograms.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function arguments, specifically data['ds'] and data['resid']. Uses imported plotting functions and libraries (matplotlib, statsmodels).",
  "sinks": "Plots visualizations; no untrusted data handling beyond standard plotting. No data is sent over the network or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., data['ds'], data['resid']) flows into plotting functions, which generate visual output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or suspicious string manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines plotting functions for time series and residual diagnostics, utilizing standard plotting libraries. It performs typical plotting routines without data manipulation or network activity. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. Functions handle data passed explicitly and generate visualizations for analysis purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard plotting utility for time series diagnostics with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It appears safe and benign.",
