{
  "purpose": "The code provides plotting functions for time series analysis, including plotting series, stacked series, and diagnostic plots for residual analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data for plotting functions (args, data dictionary with 'ds' and 'resid').",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data being sent to external systems or network, no insecure data handling, no command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments and data dictionaries into plotting functions without external or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports plotting libraries and defines functions to generate plots with customizable titles, labels, and legends. It modifies plot aesthetics and displays figures. The functions process provided data for visualization, with no external calls beyond standard plotting libraries. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code strictly focuses on visualization tasks and contains no suspicious code patterns or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward visualization utility for time series analysis with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to standard plotting practices without any malicious payloads or anomalous data handling.",
