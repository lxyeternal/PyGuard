  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a straightforward visualization utility for time series data and residual diagnostics.\n- No reports mention any suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The code relies solely on standard libraries (matplotlib, statsmodels) and a local utility module.\n- No external data transmission, file writing, or system commands are present.\n- The functions perform plotting with customization options, and the data used is passed explicitly.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. This aligns with the code review; no anomalies or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The code appears correct and well-structured. Minor points:\n  - In `plot_series`, the use of `fig.legends = []` is unconventional; normally, legends are managed via `ax.legend()`. But this isn't an error—just a design choice.\n  - The `plot_series_stacked` function calls `_plot_series` but does not handle the `ax` parameter, which may affect legend handling or plot consistency, but this isn't a security concern.\n\n- **Scores assigned by reports:**\n  - All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risks near zero, which is appropriate.\n  - The last report assigns a slightly higher `securityRisk` of 0.1, perhaps due to cautiousness, but given the benign nature, this seems overestimated.\n\n---\n\n### Specific evaluation:\n\n**Malware score:**  \nAll reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is purely for visualization.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nAll assign 0, which is accurate; no obfuscation is present.\n\n**Risk score:**  \nMost reports assign 0 or 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0.0 or very close to zero is justified.\n\n**Confidence:**  \nHigh confidence (1 or 0.95) is appropriate, as the analysis is consistent and thorough.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- No suspicious behavior is claimed or implied.\n- No data leaks, external communications, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The code relies on trusted libraries and local data.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** (benign, no malicious code)  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)  \n**Risk score:** **0** (no security risk identified)  \n**Confidence:** **1** (very high, given the consistent analysis)  \n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured visualization utility for time series and residual diagnostics.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned by reports are reasonable but could be slightly lowered for risk and security risk, given the benign nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nSet malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores to **0**. The code is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
