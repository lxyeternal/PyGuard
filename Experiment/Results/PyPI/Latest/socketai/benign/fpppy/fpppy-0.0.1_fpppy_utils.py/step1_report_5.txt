{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for plotting time series data, diagnostics, and stacked plots for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'data' dictionary parameter in 'plot_diagnostics'. Input arguments (*args, **kwargs) are used to configure plotting functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is directly written or sent to external systems. Plot functions generate visualizations using matplotlib and utilsforecast.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'data' flows into plotting functions; data from *args/**kwargs is used to generate plots; no data leaves the system or is transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on standard plotting libraries and straightforward data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports plotting libraries and defines three functions: 'plot_series', 'plot_series_stacked', and 'plot_diagnostics'. These functions generate visualizations based on input data and parameters. They utilize standard matplotlib functions and a third-party utility for plotting series. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be standard visualization code without suspicious patterns or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard plotting utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It uses common libraries for data visualization and does not handle sensitive data insecurely. Overall, it appears safe.",
