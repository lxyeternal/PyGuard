{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for plotting time series data, stacked series, and diagnostic plots such as residuals, autocorrelation, and histograms.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, specifically the 'data' dictionary in 'plot_diagnostics' and the arguments passed to plotting functions.",
  "sinks": "None observed. The code does not perform data leaks, system modifications, network communication, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into plotting functions; no untrusted data is used for security-critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets detected. The code primarily deals with plotting routines and style adjustments. No dynamic execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard plotting libraries and a custom plotting utility. Functions modify plot styles, titles, labels, legends, and display plots. The plotting routines are straightforward, with no data transformations or untrusted data handling. No suspicious behaviors such as network communication, system modifications, or code injection are present. The code appears to be solely for visualization purposes, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a set of plotting utilities intended for data visualization in time series analysis. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is clean, well-structured, and focused on visualization without external data leaks, network operations, or system manipulation.",
