  "purpose": "Visualization of time series data and residual diagnostics for time series analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data passed as function arguments, specifically 'ds' and 'resid' in data dictionary.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written to files, sent over network, or used in system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into plotting functions, with residuals used in plotting; no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides plotting functions for time series and residual diagnostics, relying on standard libraries and a local utility. It performs visualization without any network, file, or system modifications. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The functions are straightforward, with proper handling of plot aesthetics. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign visualization utility for time series analysis. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
