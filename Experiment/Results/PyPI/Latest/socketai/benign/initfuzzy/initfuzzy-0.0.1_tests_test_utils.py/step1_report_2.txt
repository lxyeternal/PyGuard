  "purpose": "Unit testing functions within the fuzzysets.utils module to ensure correctness of utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as None, integers, floats, and strings; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data, perform data leaks, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through utility functions, but these are simple validations and conversions without external communication or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are detected; the code consists solely of straightforward tests for utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains test functions using pytest to validate utility functions from the fuzzysets.utils module. All functions perform simple data validation, conversion, or calculation without external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. The code is standard test code, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It poses no threat or security concern.",
