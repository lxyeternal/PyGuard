{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test functions for the utils module in the fuzzysets package, aiming to verify the correctness of utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments and imported modules (pytest, utils).",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems or handle untrusted input that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed within utility functions; no external untrusted sources are used to influence external systems or sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets observed. The code is straightforward test code with no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing frameworks and utility functions, then performs assertions to verify expected outputs for various utility functions. There are no indications of input/output manipulation, network operations, or external data handling that could be malicious. All functions appear to perform validation or basic data transformations relevant to their purpose. No suspicious behavior or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for utility functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs straightforward validation without external data leaks, backdoors, or malicious actions.",
