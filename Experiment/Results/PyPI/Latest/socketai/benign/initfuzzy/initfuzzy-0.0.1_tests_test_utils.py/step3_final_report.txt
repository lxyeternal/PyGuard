  "purpose": "Unit tests for utility functions in the 'fuzzysets.utils' module, verifying data validation, type conversion, and simple calculations.",
  "sources": "Controlled inputs within test functions; no external data sources or untrusted input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network calls, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke utility functions with controlled inputs; no external data flow or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward and readable.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard unit tests for utility functions, with no external dependencies, network activity, or malicious intent. The functions tested perform safe, simple operations. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident, and the code's purpose is solely to verify utility functions. The scores are consistent and justified based on the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test suite with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and accurate.",
