  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious activity or security risks:**  \n   All reports consistently state that the code is straightforward unit testing for utility functions, with no external data sources, network activity, or suspicious behaviors observed. They explicitly mention the absence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. The code's purpose is solely to verify correctness.\n\n2. **Code review of the provided code snippet:**  \n   The code is a set of test functions for the `utils` module, testing functions like `default_if_none`, `to_float_if_int`, `is_membership_degree`, `validate_alpha`, `verify_is_numeric`, and `complement`. All are simple, controlled, and deterministic tests with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n3. **Assessment of the scores:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious code or behavior is detected.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, readable nature of the code.\n   - **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the lack of security concerns.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not identify any vulnerabilities or security risks, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The code does not interact with external systems or handle untrusted input in a way that could lead to security issues.\n   - The test code itself is standard and safe.\n\n5. **Final recommendations:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security concerns.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign unit test suite for utility functions, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
