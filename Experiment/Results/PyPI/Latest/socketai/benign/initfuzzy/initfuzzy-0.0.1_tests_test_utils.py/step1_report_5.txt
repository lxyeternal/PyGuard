{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'utils' module in the 'fuzzysets' package, verifying utility functions behavior.",
  "sources": "Input data for functions such as 'default_if_none', 'to_float_if_int', 'is_membership_degree', 'validate_alpha', 'verify_is_numeric', 'complement'.",
  "sinks": "Function calls that perform checks or raise exceptions, no data leaks or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through utility functions which perform validation, type conversion, or simple calculations without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected. The test code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions that invoke utility functions from the 'utils' module. These functions perform data validation, type conversion, and mathematical operations, with appropriate exception handling. No external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code is typical for unit testing purposes, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of unit tests verifying utility functions and contains no malicious behavior or security issues. It appears benign, serving only to validate code correctness.",
