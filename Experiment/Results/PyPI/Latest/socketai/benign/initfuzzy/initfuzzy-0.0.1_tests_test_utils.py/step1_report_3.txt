{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of test functions for utility functions in the 'fuzzysets' library, validating behavior and input validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static values and calls utility functions from 'fuzzysets.utils' with these values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs that could lead to data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (constants or function arguments) flows through utility functions, which perform validation or computation, without external or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward testing of utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pytest' for testing and calls various functions from 'fuzzysets.utils' with static inputs, asserting expected outputs or exceptions. All inputs are hardcoded or derived from function parameters; no external data, environment variables, or system interactions are evident. The tests verify input validation and computation functions. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors, are present. The code is typical test code for a Python library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard test code for utility functions with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply validates correct behavior of functions in the 'fuzzysets.utils' module.",
