  "purpose": "Unit tests for utility functions in the fuzzysets.utils module",
  "sources": "Import statements and test function calls that provide input data to utility functions",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only tests utility functions with controlled inputs",
  "flows": "Input data flows from test assertions into utility functions, with no external or untrusted data sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code strictly performs standard unit testing without unusual code patterns or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing libraries and utility functions, then defines several test cases to verify utility function behaviors such as default value substitution, type conversion, range validation, and logical complement. All inputs are hardcoded within the test functions, and no external data, environment variables, or network activity are involved. The tests do not include or execute any malicious code, and the utility functions are invoked with controlled data. The code appears to be straightforward unit testing code, with no obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or potential security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks. It is safe and intended solely for verifying correct utility function behavior.",
