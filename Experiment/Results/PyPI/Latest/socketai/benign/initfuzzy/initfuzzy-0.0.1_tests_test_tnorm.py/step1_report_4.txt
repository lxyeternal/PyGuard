{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate and plot fuzzy sets, specifically Cauchy fuzzy sets, and apply a t-norm and t-conorm operations for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries: matplotlib, numpy, cauchyfuzzyset, tfn, tnorm; creation of fuzzy set objects; use of np.linspace for data generation; reading attributes and methods from fuzzy set objects; execution of tnorm operations.",
  "sinks": "Plotting functions that generate visual output; no evident sinks that lead to data leakage or malicious effects; no external data transmission or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Input data via np.linspace and object methods -> computation of fuzzy set membership functions and tnorm/tconorm operations -> plotting of results for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code flows. All functions and variables appear standard and related to data visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports well-known visualization and numerical libraries, along with domain-specific fuzzy logic libraries. It constructs fuzzy sets, computes their membership values across a range, and applies t-norm and t-conorm operations. The plotting commands visualize these results. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or system modifications are present. The code is straightforward and focused on data visualization of fuzzy sets and their operations.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign data visualization tool for fuzzy sets and their logical operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data theft. It appears safe for use, with no security risks identified.",
