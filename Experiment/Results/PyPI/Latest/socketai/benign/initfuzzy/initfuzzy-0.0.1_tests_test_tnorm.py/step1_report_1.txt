{
  "purpose": "The code visualizes fuzzy sets and their t-norm and t-conorm operations for the purpose of data analysis or demonstration of fuzzy logic concepts.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the definitions of fuzzy sets (`c`, `d`) and the functions `mu`, `tnorm`, and `tconorm`. It also uses `np.linspace` to generate data for plotting.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a plot saved as 'test.png'. It does not transmit or send data over a network or to external systems.",
  "flows": "The fuzzy set definitions and parameters flow into plotting functions. The `tnorm` object processes input values from the fuzzy sets to produce results for plotting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The code appears straightforward and focused on visualization. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard visualization and numerical libraries, along with custom fuzzy logic classes. It creates two fuzzy sets and plots their membership functions. It then computes and plots the t-norm and t-conorm of these sets. The code uses standard, well-known libraries and custom classes likely intended for fuzzy logic operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. The purpose appears to be educational or demonstrative, with no suspicious or harmful intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data visualization script demonstrating fuzzy logic operations. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs mathematical operations and saves a plot image.",
