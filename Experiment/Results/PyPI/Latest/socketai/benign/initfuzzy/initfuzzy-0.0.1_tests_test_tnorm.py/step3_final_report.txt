  "purpose": "Visualization of fuzzy sets and their t-norm/t-conorm operations using custom fuzzy logic classes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the creation of fuzzy set objects and parameters; no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to plot and saves an image file; no data leaks or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Creates fuzzy sets -> computes membership functions -> applies t-norm/t-conorm -> plots results -> saves image.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in plot label ('Fuzzy Set)') but no malicious or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and custom modules for fuzzy set visualization, creates fuzzy sets, computes their membership functions, applies t-norm and t-conorm, and plots the results. No network activity, data exfiltration, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The only issue is a trivial typo in the plot label. The code is straightforward and domain-specific, with no indicators of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization script demonstrating fuzzy set operations. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score reflects the benign nature of the code.",
