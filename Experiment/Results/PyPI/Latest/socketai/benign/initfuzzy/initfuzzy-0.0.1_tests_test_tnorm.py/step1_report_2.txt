{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate and plot fuzzy sets, their membership functions, and apply t-norm and t-conorm operations, then save the plot as an image.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external libraries and modules; creation of fuzzy set objects; data generation via numpy.linspace; function calls on fuzzy set objects and tnorm instance.",
  "sinks": "Plotting functions that generate visual output; file-saving function 'plt.savefig'.",
  "flows": "Data from fuzzy set objects and numpy arrays are used directly in plotting; tnorm object methods are applied to inputs and plotted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed; usage of standard plotting and mathematical operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports common plotting and numerical libraries, creates fuzzy set objects, and plots their membership functions. It then applies t-norm and t-conorm operations and plots the results, finally saving the output as an image. All code appears straightforward, using external modules and standard library functions. No code indicates malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data visualization script related to fuzzy set theory, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
