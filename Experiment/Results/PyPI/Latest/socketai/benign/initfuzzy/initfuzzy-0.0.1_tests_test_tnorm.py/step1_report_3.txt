{
  "purpose": "The code visualizes fuzzy sets and their t-norm and t-conorm operations using matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Imports modules for mathematical operations and plotting; creates instances of CauchyFuzzySet; reads x-values for plotting; calls methods mu, tnorm, tconorm.",
  "sinks": "Plots data using matplotlib; saves figure to 'test.png'. No untrusted data outputs or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Reads fuzzy set parameters -> computes membership values -> applies t-norm/t-conorm -> plots results -> saves plot image.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward creation of fuzzy sets, computes their membership functions, applies t-norm and t-conorm operations, and visualizes the results. All methods and functions appear to be standard and intended for data visualization. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or code obfuscation. Usage of plotting functions and file saving is typical for visualization purposes. The imported modules seem to be custom but do not suggest malicious intent based on the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data visualization script involving fuzzy sets and their operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code fragment.",
