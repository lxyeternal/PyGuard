{
  "purpose": "The code contains unit tests for various classes related to fuzzy set operations, specifically testing behavior and mathematical operations for Polynomial, AlphaCut, and TriangularFuzzyNumber classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via test inputs such as tuples, numerical values, and class instances (e.g., from_tuple method, test parameters). No external untrusted data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output to network, file, or other external systems. No use of environment variables, environment-specific data, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through class methods and operators to produce internal attribute values or comparisons. No untrusted data is used in a way that leads to external effects.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily consists of test functions verifying class behaviors. No signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments. No obfuscated or misleading code features. No dynamic code execution, code injection, or system manipulation is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of structured unit tests targeting specific classes and methods. Tests focus on correctness of mathematical operations, data validation, and class behaviors. There are no signs of malicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor access. The code appears to serve a legitimate testing purpose for mathematical fuzzy set operations. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for fuzzy number classes and related functions, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly tests mathematical behavior and class validation logic without external or harmful operations.",
