{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the ContinuousDomain and ContinuousFuzzySet classes in the fuzzysets library, verifying correctness and behavior of methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from pytest.raises (to test error conditions), class constructors, and lambda functions used in method calls.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used in a harmful way; the code does not include data transmission, system modification, or resource access.",
  "flows": "Input validation triggers exceptions in tests; no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks. Lambda functions are internally invoked for calculations, but they are defined within the test scope.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments. The code strictly appears to be standard unit tests. No obfuscated or misleading code features are present. No external network, file, or system modification commands are included.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests for two classes, verifying their behavior through assertions and exception handling. All operations involve standard class instantiations, comparisons, and lambda functions for mathematical computations within a testing framework. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system control, or network activity is observable. The lambda functions used are safe and confined to the test scope. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for two classes, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It does not pose security risks and functions solely for validation purposes within a controlled testing environment.",
