{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the ContinuousDomain and ContinuousFuzzySet classes, verifying their correctness and behavior.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pytest' and the classes from 'fuzzysets.sets.continuous'. It reads test cases and class methods but does not process external input or data from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious actions such as network connections, file modifications, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The tests create instances of classes and invoke methods to verify expected behavior. There are no flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; no data processing from external inputs that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely test definitions with standard assertions. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. All functions are standard class tests without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of pytest unit tests for classes related to fuzzy set theory. It validates initialization, comparison operators, set operations, and representations. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or system modifications are observed. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or network operations are present. The code adheres to typical testing practices without malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite verifying the functionality of fuzzy set classes. It contains no malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is a standard, safe test code with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
