{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test cases for the ContinuousDomain and ContinuousFuzzySet classes, validating their behavior and correctness.",
  "sources": "The code reads class initializations, method calls, and property accesses within test functions, primarily from the imported classes and functions used in tests.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage, system modification, or network communication.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve constructing objects, calling methods, and checking their return values, with no untrusted data input or external system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present. The code solely consists of test functions verifying class behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing using pytest for classes related to fuzzy sets and continuous domains. It involves class instantiation, property validation, comparison operations, and mathematical function tests. No network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution are present. No signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads are observed. The use of assertions and exception checks is typical for testing, and all operations appear safe and controlled.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of unit tests validating the behavior of the ContinuousDomain and ContinuousFuzzySet classes. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It is standard test code with no suspicious or harmful behavior.",
