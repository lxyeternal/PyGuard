{
  "purpose": "The code consists of pytest unit tests for the classes ContinuousDomain and ContinuousFuzzySet, validating their behavior, error handling, and comparison operators.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, property accessors, comparison operators, and method calls within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external system calls, network interactions, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of classes -> method/property calls -> assertions and exception checks; no external data flow or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests verifying class behavior with no external dependencies or side effects. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements are present. The tests only invoke class methods and properties, with assertions confirming expected outcomes. The code does not perform any network, file, or environment modifications. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, test-only nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a comprehensive test suite for the specified classes. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
