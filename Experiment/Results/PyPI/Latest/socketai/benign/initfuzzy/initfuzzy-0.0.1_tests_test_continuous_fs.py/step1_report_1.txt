  "purpose": "Unit tests for the ContinuousDomain and ContinuousFuzzySet classes, verifying their initialization, properties, and comparison methods.",
  "sources": "Imports pytest and specific classes from fuzzysets.sets.continuous; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions, no data outputs, no network operations, no file writes, no environment variable access, no database or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely performs in-memory tests of class methods and properties.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The code strictly consists of unit test functions with no external or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of pytest unit tests targeting the ContinuousDomain and ContinuousFuzzySet classes. It only invokes class constructors, property accessors, comparison operators, and methods for testing purposes. There are no network calls, system modifications, or data leaks. Usage of external libraries is solely for testing frameworks and the classes under test. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code structures are present. All tests serve to validate the correctness of the classes' functionality. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or harmful. It is purely for testing and validation of existing code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of unit tests with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and solely focused on verifying class functionalities. No malicious or suspicious activities are present.",
