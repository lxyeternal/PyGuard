{
  "purpose": "The code implements a fuzzy logic inference system for a washing cloth quality assessment based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy, typing, and custom fuzzy set and inference modules; uses data from defined TriangularFuzzyNumber instances and fixed numerical values.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or written; the code primarily performs internal calculations and outputs the result.",
  "flows": "Input data (p1, p2, and fuzzy sets) flow into the MamdaniInference system via add_rule and infer methods; no external data or user input is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of fixed numerical values and explicit imports is typical for such applications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a fuzzy inference system with well-defined inputs, rules, and output calculation. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The modules imported are standard for fuzzy logic applications, and their usage appears legitimate. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or security breaches. The overall structure and data flow are typical for a fuzzy inference setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a fuzzy logic inference task for cloth washing quality assessment with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard implementation with no suspicious elements.",
