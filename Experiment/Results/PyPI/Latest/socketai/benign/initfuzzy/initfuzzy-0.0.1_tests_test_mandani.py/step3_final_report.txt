{
  "purpose": "The code implements a fuzzy inference system to assess cloth dirtiness and washing parameters using fuzzy sets, rules, and Mamdani inference.",
  "sources": "Predefined fuzzy sets and rule parameters within the code; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "Outputs a defuzzified numerical result printed to the console; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from fuzzy set definitions and rule antecedents through the Mamdani inference process to produce a numerical output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward and domain-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard fuzzy logic constructs with explicit rule definitions and no external data handling or network activity. It imports external modules for fuzzy operations, but these are used in a typical manner. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The fixed parameters and static nature of the code do not introduce security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign and controlled nature of the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent fuzzy inference system with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate; all indicate a safe and benign implementation. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
