{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a fuzzy logic inference system for some form of decision or classification related to cloth dirtiness or washing parameters, using fuzzy sets and inference rules.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules ('cauchyfuzzyset', 'tfn', 'tnorm', 'inference') and reading from the console via 'print'.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the 'print' statement outputting the result of the inference.",
  "flows": "Data flows from fuzzy set definitions and rule antecedents through the Mamdani inference system to produce a defuzzified output, which is then printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected. The code strictly performs fuzzy logic operations, with no evidence of data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious system manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines fuzzy numbers and rules, constructs a Mamdani inference system, adds rules based on fuzzy conjunctions ('AND'), performs inference, and outputs the result. All code segments use standard libraries and well-defined functions related to fuzzy logic. There are no hardcoded credentials, system commands, network calls, or obfuscated code. The imported modules are external but used here in a standard manner without suspicious activity. The print statement is only used for output. The code does not interact with files, environment variables, or perform any action that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a fuzzy inference system with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It performs fuzzy logic computations for a decision system, likely related to cloth maintenance, without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
