{
  "purpose": "The code implements a fuzzy logic inference system for assessing cloth dirtiness, likely for an automation or control application.",
  "sources": "The code reads numerical values for parameters (p1, p2, and various fuzzy numbers) and inputs from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or file writing observed; only output via print statement.",
  "flows": "Input values are used in fuzzy inference rules, which are processed to produce a defuzzified output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be straightforward fuzzy logic implementation with imported fuzzy set libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code imports fuzzy set libraries and constructs multiple fuzzy numbers and rules to perform Mamdani inference. It defines several fuzzy variables, combines them with AND operations, adds rules to an inference system, and performs inference on sample inputs. There are no signs of malicious data handling, network activity, or system manipulation. The overall structure is typical for a fuzzy logic control system, and no suspicious code behavior or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard fuzzy logic inference system intended for control or decision-making purposes related to cloth dirtiness assessment. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It is safe based on the provided content.",
