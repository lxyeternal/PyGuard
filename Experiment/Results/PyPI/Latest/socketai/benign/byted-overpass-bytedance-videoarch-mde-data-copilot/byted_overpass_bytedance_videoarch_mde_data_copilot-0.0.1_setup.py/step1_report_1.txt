  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package using setuptools, primarily as a placeholder to mitigate dependency confusion risks.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "None of the input or data reads appear to be directed toward untrusted data handling or output effects.",
  "flows": "The content reads 'README.md' and passes it to setup(), with no untrusted data processing or external network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, using setuptools. It reads a local 'README.md' file for the long description. The code contains no network calls, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or other suspicious behaviors. The use of 'find_packages()' is typical for package discovery. The package is marked as 'Inactive', indicating it is likely a placeholder. Overall, the script appears to be a benign and typical package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily serves to define package metadata and configuration.",
