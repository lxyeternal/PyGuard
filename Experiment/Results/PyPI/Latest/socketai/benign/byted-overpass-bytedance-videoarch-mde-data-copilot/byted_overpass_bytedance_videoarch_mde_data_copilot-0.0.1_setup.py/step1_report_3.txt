  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for a Python package, including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external output or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading 'README.md' into the 'long_description' parameter.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read a file without error handling could be a concern, but is standard in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools to configure package installation. It specifies package metadata, including name, version, author info, URL, and classifiers. The 'long_description' is read directly from 'README.md' without validation or sanitization, which is typical but not inherently malicious. No use of dynamic code execution, environment variables, or external data sources that could be malicious. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. The code appears to serve a benign purpose related to package configuration. No evidence of malware or malicious intent. It is a straightforward setup script with no malicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no malicious behavior detected. It primarily reads a README file for description and defines package metadata. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
