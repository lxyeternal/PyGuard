  "conclusion": "The code pattern is highly suspicious due to dynamic, obfuscated loading and execution of external code without validation. While it does not contain malware by itself, it has a high potential to be malicious if the ZIP archive contains harmful code. The risk and obfuscation scores are appropriate; the malware score could be slightly increased to reflect the pattern's typical use in malicious contexts."
