{
  "purpose": "Provides a web interface for uploading an XML sitemap, saving it locally, and analyzing it via an external function.",
  "sources": "File upload input from user, reading the uploaded file buffer, and passing the file path to analyze_sitemap.",
  "sinks": "Writing the uploaded file to disk, passing the file path to analyze_sitemap, displaying results, and offering CSV download.",
  "flows": "User uploads file -> file saved locally -> file path passed to analyze_sitemap -> results displayed and downloadable.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Streamlit app handling file upload, local storage, and invoking an external analysis function. It uses standard practices with no suspicious patterns. The security of the overall process depends on analyze_sitemap, which is external and unverified, but the code itself is benign. No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are present. The file handling is safe, and no network activity or data leaks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this assessment. The main external dependency introduces some uncertainty but does not impact the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation for uploading and analyzing sitemaps with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the external analyze_sitemap function, which cannot be assessed here. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign behavior.",
