  "purpose": "A web application for uploading a sitemap XML file, analyzing it for SEO, and displaying the results.",
  "sources": "User-uploaded file via st.file_uploader, file buffer accessed with getbuffer()",
  "sinks": "Writing uploaded file to local filesystem, reading and processing the file, displaying data, offering download",
  "flows": "Upload file -> save to local disk -> analyze_sitemap function -> display results / offer download",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. Usage of external library 'analyze_sitemap' is standard and assumed benign; no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple web interface for uploading an XML file, saves it temporarily, and passes the file path to an analysis function. The upload process uses standard Streamlit components, and the file handling appears straightforward. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The only external dependency is 'analyze_sitemap', which is assumed to be a benign analysis utility. No suspicious activities, obfuscated code, or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign application designed for SEO analysis of sitemap files. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It follows standard practices for file handling and user interaction with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
