  "purpose": "Provides a web interface for uploading a sitemap XML file and analyzing its SEO content using an external analysis function.",
  "sources": "Reads the uploaded sitemap file via `st.file_uploader` and writes it to the local filesystem with `open()`.",
  "sinks": "Writes the uploaded file to disk; calls external function `analyze_sitemap`; outputs analysis results and provides a download button for CSV.",
  "flows": "User uploads file -> file is saved locally -> analyze_sitemap function is called with file path -> results displayed and made downloadable.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard Streamlit components; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, network connections, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical file upload handling with proper saving to disk, then calls an external analysis function, and displays results. No code injection, malicious network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The reliance on an external function 'analyze_sitemap' is noted, but assuming it is safe, the overall code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a straightforward web app for sitemap analysis without any evident malicious intent or security issues. It handles files securely within the context of a user session and provides results with an option for download. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are detected.",
