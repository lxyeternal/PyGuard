  "purpose": "Web application for uploading a sitemap XML file and analyzing it for SEO using an external analysis function.",
  "sources": "User uploads a file through the file uploader widget; the code reads the uploaded file buffer and writes it to a local file on disk.",
  "sinks": "Writing uploaded file to disk (`open(upload_path, 'wb')`); calling external analysis function `analyze_sitemap`; generating and providing a CSV download of results.",
  "flows": "Uploaded file data flows from the user through the file uploader widget, is written to disk, then passed to `analyze_sitemap`. The analysis results are displayed and can be downloaded.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. The code performs standard file handling and UI display operations. Import of external analysis function is benign unless the function itself is malicious, which cannot be determined here.",
  "analysis": "The code facilitates user upload of an XML sitemap file, saves it locally, and processes it with an external analysis function. The file handling is straightforward and typical for web apps. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. The use of `os.path.join` and standard file operations poses no risk. The analysis function's internal behavior is unknown, but its invocation here is safe based on this snippet. No insecure practices, hardcoded credentials, or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate web app for sitemap analysis with no evident malicious intent. It handles user input and file processing securely and simply, with no signs of malware or security risks in this fragment.",
