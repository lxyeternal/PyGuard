  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward web app facilitating sitemap uploads, saving files locally, and invoking an external analysis function.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or network activity is observed.\n- The primary concern revolves around the external `analyze_sitemap` function, which is not provided. The security and potential maliciousness of the overall system depend heavily on this function's implementation.\n- The code handles user input securely within the scope of standard file operations, with no evident vulnerabilities or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly reads the uploaded file buffer, writes it to disk, and passes the path to `analyze_sitemap`. The display and download functionalities are implemented properly.\n- **Potential issues:** No evident issues in the code snippet itself.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **No errors or flaws** are apparent in the code. The logic is straightforward and standard.\n- **Security considerations:** While the code itself is safe, reliance on an external function without validation could be a concern, but that is outside this code snippet.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's benign appearance.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1 - 0.2). Given the code's simplicity, this seems appropriate, assuming the external function is safe.\n\n### Special attention to risk and malware scores:\n- Since **malware** is scored 0 across all reports, there's no indication of malicious activity.\n- The **security risk** scores are low, reflecting minimal inherent risks in this code snippet.\n\n### Potential issues based on assumptions:\n- The reports correctly note that the main risk lies in the external `analyze_sitemap` function. Without its implementation, the overall security cannot be fully assessed.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Scores consistency:** The assigned scores seem reasonable and aligned with the code's content.\n- **Adjustments:** No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent with all reports)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal inherent risk, assuming external function is safe)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a typical web app interface for file upload and processing, with no malicious or suspicious activity evident. The primary concern remains the external analysis function, which cannot be evaluated here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears benign, with no malware or obfuscation. The risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the external `analyze_sitemap` implementation. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code snippet.",
