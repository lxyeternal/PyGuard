  "purpose": "A web application tool for uploading a sitemap XML file, analyzing it for SEO purposes, and displaying results.",
  "sources": "The file uploader widget (`st.file_uploader`) and the `analyze_sitemap` function imported from an external module.",
  "sinks": "File writing to 'uploaded_sitemap.xml', calling `analyze_sitemap` with user-uploaded file path, and converting analysis result to CSV for download.",
  "flows": "User uploads file → File saved locally → File path passed to `analyze_sitemap` → Result dataframe generated → Dataframe displayed and offered for download.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual dynamic code execution observed. Use of external analysis function `analyze_sitemap` depends on its implementation, which is not provided.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles user-uploaded files, saves them locally, and processes them with an external function. It writes files based on user input but does not involve any network connections, system command execution, or sensitive data handling within this code. The use of `os.getcwd()` to determine the path is standard. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected in this segment. However, the security of the process depends on the implementation of `analyze_sitemap`. If `analyze_sitemap` contains malicious code, it could pose a risk, but this cannot be assessed from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign web app for analyzing sitemaps with no evident malicious intent or security risks in this snippet. It relies on an external function whose content is unknown, so risk assessment of that part cannot be made. Overall, this code is safe but should ensure `analyze_sitemap` is also secure.",
