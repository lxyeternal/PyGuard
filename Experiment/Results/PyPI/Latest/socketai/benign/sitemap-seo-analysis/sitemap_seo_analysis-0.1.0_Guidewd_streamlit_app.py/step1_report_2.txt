  "purpose": "A web-based tool for uploading and analyzing sitemaps for SEO purposes.",
  "sources": "The uploaded file via st.file_uploader, read into memory and saved locally as 'uploaded_sitemap.xml'.",
  "sinks": "Saving uploaded file to disk with open/write; calling external analysis function analyze_sitemap; displaying results; providing a download button.",
  "flows": "Upload -> Save file locally -> analyze_sitemap() function -> display results -> download button for results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behaviors observed. Usage of standard libraries. The code relies on an external function analyze_sitemap, but its content is not provided. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script securely handles file upload via streamlit's file_uploader, saving the file temporarily in the current working directory. It then calls an external analysis function, presumably to process the sitemap. The results are displayed and made available for download. All file operations and external calls are standard and do not exhibit malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or malicious actions are detected within this code. Potential risks depend on analyze_sitemap's implementation, which is outside this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward web interface for uploading and analyzing sitemaps, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It safely manages user input, external function invocation, and output presentation. No malware or security issues are evident within this snippet.",
