  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a simple, static string assignment",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string, typical in Python packages. It contains no input handling, external data, network activity, or dynamic behavior. The code is clear, simple, and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
