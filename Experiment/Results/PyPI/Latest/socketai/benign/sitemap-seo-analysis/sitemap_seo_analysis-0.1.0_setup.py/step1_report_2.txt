  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'sitemap-seo-analysis', including dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description; static list of dependencies; static entry points for CLI commands.",
  "sinks": "No data flows to untrusted sources; setup parameters are static and well-defined, no runtime data handling involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only initializes package setup parameters without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to configure package installation. It reads a README file for description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, entry points for CLI scripts, and classifiers. All components are static and standard. No suspicious dynamic code, external data injection, or malicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate package configuration code.",
