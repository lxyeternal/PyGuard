{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project related to sitemap SEO analysis.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long_description, package discovery via find_packages(), and dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data leaks or untrusted data usage detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup configuration is static and standard.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. All dependencies are common Python packages. Entry points specify CLI commands but do not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical setup configuration using setuptools, reading a README file for description, specifying package info, dependencies, and entry points for CLI commands. All code appears standard, with no suspicious code, network activity, or malicious behavior. No obfuscated or malicious patterns detected. The code strictly handles package metadata and configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
