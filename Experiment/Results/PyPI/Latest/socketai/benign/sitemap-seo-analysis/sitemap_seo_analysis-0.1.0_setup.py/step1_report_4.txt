  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects; primarily package setup and dependency installation.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified; setup scripts are static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README.md file, defines package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. There are no indications of malicious code, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. All dependencies are common packages, and the script's purpose is clear. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or other security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be safe and correctly structured.",
