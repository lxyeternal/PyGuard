  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package called 'sitemap-seo-analysis', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points for command-line scripts.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, defining install_requires dependencies, specifying entry points for CLI commands.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output is visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and standard.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected. The code is straightforward and follows typical packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, reads a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No input handling, data processing, or untrusted data sources are involved. No suspicious code structures or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears safe and legitimate.",
