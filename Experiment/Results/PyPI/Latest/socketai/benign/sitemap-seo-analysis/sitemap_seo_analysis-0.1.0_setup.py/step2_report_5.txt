  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores and claims.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools.\n- It reads a README.md file for long_description.\n- It specifies dependencies (`requests`, `streamlit`, `pandas`).\n- It defines CLI entry points (`analyze-sitemap`, `sitemap-seo-gui`).\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical setup script with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Similar, with a note on securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Analysis:** The only deviation is the `securityRisk` score of 0.1, which is very low and not justified by any actual risk in the code.\n- **Assessment:** Since the code is static and standard, a security risk score of 0.1 seems unwarranted.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce `securityRisk` to 0.0 for consistency.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. **0** is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation. **0** is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** For reports 1, 2, 4, 5, **0** is correct. For report 3, a slight increase to 0.1 is unjustified; it should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks in the static setup script)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward, legitimate setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's content, except for report 3's minor securityRisk score, which should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of recommendations:**\n\n- Confirm all reports' scores as accurate, with the exception of report 3's `securityRisk`, which should be **0**.\n- No further action needed; the code appears safe and standard.",
