{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to check for the presence of the Streamlit library, install it if necessary, and then run a Streamlit app from a specified script file.",
  "sources": "Code reads from __file__ to determine the script directory, and checks for import of streamlit or installs it via pip.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to 'pip install' and 'streamlit run' are execution points that can execute arbitrary commands or scripts.",
  "flows": "Code flow begins with import statements, then attempts to import streamlit, potentially installing it, and finally runs 'streamlit run' on 'streamlit_app.py' located relative to current script.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected. Use of subprocess to install packages and run external processes could be risky if the script path is manipulated or compromised, but there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for and installs the streamlit package if missing, then runs a Streamlit application located in the same directory as the script. It uses subprocess to invoke pip and streamlit commands, which are standard for such automation scripts. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The code does not perform any network communication beyond invoking external commands, and the external commands are related to application execution. The code appears to be a typical setup script for launching a Streamlit app, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for starting a Streamlit app, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. It is a typical automation pattern with no suspicious elements.",
