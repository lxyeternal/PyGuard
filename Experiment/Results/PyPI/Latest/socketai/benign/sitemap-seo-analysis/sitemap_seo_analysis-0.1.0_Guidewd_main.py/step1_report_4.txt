{
  "purpose": "The script dynamically installs and runs a Streamlit application from a specified file path.",
  "sources": "Reads the current script location (__file__), imports subprocess, os, sys, and conditionally imports streamlit.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.check_call to install packages and subprocess.run to execute 'streamlit run', which can execute arbitrary code via streamlit_app.py.",
  "flows": "Input (__file__, system environment) flows into subprocess commands that execute external scripts and install packages.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamically installing packages during runtime can be risky if the environment is compromised. No explicit validation of 'streamlit_app.py' content is present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to ensure Streamlit is installed, then runs a Streamlit app located relative to the script. It uses subprocess to run external commands, which could be exploited if the 'streamlit_app.py' file or environment is maliciously altered. The code itself does not contain malicious instructions, but its behavior depends heavily on the content of 'streamlit_app.py'. Installing packages at runtime can introduce risks if package sources are compromised or if the environment is untrusted. The code's structure is straightforward and does not include obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a launcher for a Streamlit app with dynamic dependency installation. It does not contain malicious code itself but relies on external scripts and environment conditions. Its behavior is potentially risky if the environment or 'streamlit_app.py' is malicious or compromised.",
