{
  "purpose": "A launcher script that ensures 'streamlit' is installed and runs a local Streamlit app.",
  "sources": "Checks for 'streamlit' import, attempts installation via subprocess if missing, reads the 'streamlit_app.py' path relative to current file.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing 'pip install streamlit' and 'streamlit run' commands, executing external scripts and package managers.",
  "flows": "Source: import and conditional installation of 'streamlit'; Sink: subprocess calls executing package installation and app launch; Flow: environment and package state influence subprocess execution.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, straightforward dependency check and execution, reliance on environment variables and external commands without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency management and app launching with subprocess. It does not contain malicious logic or obfuscation. Risks stem from environment trustworthiness and potential manipulation of subprocess commands or the target script. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The subprocess calls could be exploited if environment is compromised, but the code itself is benign. Scores reflect this: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, security risk around 0.2-0.3 due to environment considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign launcher with minimal security concerns, primarily related to environment trust and dynamic installation. No malicious intent or code is detected. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
