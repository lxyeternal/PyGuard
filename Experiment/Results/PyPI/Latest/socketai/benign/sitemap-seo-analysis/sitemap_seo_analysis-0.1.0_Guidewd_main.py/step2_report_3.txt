  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes. The code installs 'streamlit' dynamically and runs 'streamlit run' on a local script.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No malicious code detected. The main concern is the dynamic installation without version validation and the use of subprocess, which could be exploited if environment is compromised.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0. The low malware score aligns with the code's benign nature. The security risk is minimal but exists due to dynamic install.\n- **Justification for Scores:** The code does not perform malicious actions; it’s a launcher. The risk stems from environment trustworthiness, not malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, no malware, straightforward launcher.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes. Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on potential risks if 'streamlit_app.py' is malicious.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No malicious behavior, but the lack of verification for the script or package source is noted.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.3, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** The code's behavior is benign; the main concern is environment integrity.\n- **Conclusion:** Slightly higher security risk due to package installation without validation, but still low.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes. Same pattern—installing and running a local app.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No malicious code, standard approach.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent, minimal risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, typical launcher.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes. Same pattern.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No malicious code, but risks from dynamic installation and external script execution.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.3, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious activity; risk is environmental.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, benign launcher.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes. Same as others.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No malicious code, straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent; environment trust is the main concern.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard launcher.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious code or behavior. The code is a launcher script that installs dependencies and runs an app.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated due to dynamic installation and subprocess execution, but overall low because no malicious activity is present.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0**.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at **0**.\n- The **risk score** could be adjusted slightly higher, perhaps around **0.2-0.3**, due to the environment and dependency installation concerns, but not higher since there's no malicious intent.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical launcher for a Streamlit app, with no signs of malicious behavior. The main security considerations relate to environment trustworthiness and the risks of dynamic package installation, but these are common and manageable in controlled environments.",
