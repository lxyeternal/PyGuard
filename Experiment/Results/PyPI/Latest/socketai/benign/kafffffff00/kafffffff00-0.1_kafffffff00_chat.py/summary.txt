  "conclusion": "The code is benign in functionality but insecure due to the hardcoded API key. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary security issue is credential exposure, which warrants a higher security risk score. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a risk score around 0.6-0.75 is justified based on the severity of credential exposure."
