      "conclusion": "The package is benign, serving as a standard setup configuration. The main concerns are the unusual package name and the mention of an API key in the description, which could be red flags if the package content elsewhere contains secrets or malicious code. Based solely on this script, there is no malicious behavior detected."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign in functionality but insecure due to the hardcoded API key. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary security issue is credential exposure, which warrants a higher security risk score. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a risk score around 0.6-0.75 is justified based on the severity of credential exposure."
