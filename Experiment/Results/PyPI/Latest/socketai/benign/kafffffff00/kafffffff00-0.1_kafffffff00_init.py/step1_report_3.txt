  "purpose": "Import the 'start_deepseek_chat' function from the 'chat' module, likely to initiate a chat or interaction process.",
  "sources": "The import statement from the 'chat' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports a function but does not execute or call it, so no data flow occurs beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, contains only an import statement, and includes no executable logic, data handling, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script only contains metadata comments and a single import statement. There are no variables, data processing, network connections, or code execution beyond the import. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The presence of the import does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import with no malicious activity or security issues detected. It appears to be part of a larger system, and on its own, it does not pose any security threat.",
