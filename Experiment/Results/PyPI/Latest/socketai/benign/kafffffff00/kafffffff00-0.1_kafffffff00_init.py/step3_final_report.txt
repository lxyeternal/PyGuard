  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import with metadata comments, no function calls, data processing, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The high confidence scores reflect the benign nature. The minimal security risk score of approximately 0.1 is appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and scores are consistent with the minimal code. No adjustments are necessary.",
