{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named start_deepseek_chat from a module called chat, likely to initiate a chat-based interaction or service.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'chat' and the attribute 'start_deepseek_chat' within it.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or data leak points are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing the function to potentially executing it elsewhere; no execution or data flow is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, contains no visible hardcoded secrets, input handling, or malicious indicators. The filename suggests it was created in 2025, but that alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from an external module but does not perform any operations or data handling within the snippet. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. Its simplicity limits the scope of risk assessment, but based solely on this, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It is likely part of a larger application that utilizes the imported function.",
