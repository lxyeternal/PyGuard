{
  "purpose": "Import a function 'start_deepseek_chat' from the module 'chat', likely to initiate or manage a chat or AI interaction.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'chat' module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in the code",
  "flows": "Import of 'start_deepseek_chat' from 'chat' module, with no further data flow or execution shown",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure; no usage of input/output, environment variables, or suspicious patterns; the code is mostly boilerplate with a timestamp and author comment",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from an external module without executing or manipulating it. The timestamp and author comment provide metadata but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The module 'chat' might be part of a larger project, but this snippet alone shows no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with metadata comments; no malicious or security-related issues are evident based on this fragment.",
