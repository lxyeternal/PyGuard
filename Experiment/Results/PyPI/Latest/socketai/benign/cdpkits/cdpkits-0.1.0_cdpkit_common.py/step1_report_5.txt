  "purpose": "Define base models and a generic class for handling method commands and responses in a structured way, likely for an API or SDK.",
  "sources": "inspect.getfile(self.__class__) for dynamic filename retrieval; no other external data inputs observed.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used in potentially harmful operations. No network, file, or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Construction of 'command' dictionary using class and filename info; no flow leading to data exfiltration or malicious action.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.getfile() to dynamically determine filename and generate method strings. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models with strict validation to prevent extra or missing fields. The CDPMethod class generates a method command string based on class filename and name, which appears to be standard reflection for API method invocation. No external inputs or outputs suggest malicious intent. The dynamic filename retrieval does not introduce security issues here but is a reflective feature. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation for API method handling using Pydantic models and reflection. No malicious or maliciously crafted behavior detected. The only potentially notable feature is the dynamic filename usage, which is benign in this context.",
