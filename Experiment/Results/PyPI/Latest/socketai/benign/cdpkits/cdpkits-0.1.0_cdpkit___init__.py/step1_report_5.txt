  "anomalies": "Presence of only version string assignments; no anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns string literals to two module-level variables indicating version numbers. There are no input/output operations, no code execution, and no external data handling. It appears to be standard metadata declaration. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for version metadata declaration and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
