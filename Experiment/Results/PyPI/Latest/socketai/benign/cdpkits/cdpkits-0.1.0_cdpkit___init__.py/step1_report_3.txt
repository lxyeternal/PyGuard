  "sinks": "None detected; no data handling, network operations, or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "None, as there are no data flows or input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of straightforward variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string values to two version variables. There are no inputs, no external data reads, no functions, and no operations that could lead to security risks. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The minimal and static nature of this code indicates it's for version tracking or metadata purpose only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as metadata declarations for versioning. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
