  "purpose": "Defines version information for the package using static string assignments.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static strings to __version__ and __cdp_version__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static variable assignments only.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignments do not involve external input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and contains no dynamic or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for version metadata, with no input/output, dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, metadata-only code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign metadata with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
