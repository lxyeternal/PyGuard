{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for parsing a pyproject.toml, mapping dependencies to Gentoo package formats, and generating ebuild scripts, all based on controlled input data.",
  "sources": "Reading from temporary files, in-memory data structures, and static strings within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external network calls, or code execution points are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from controlled input sources (files, strings) through parsing and mapping functions to the final ebuild string generation, with no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of straightforward unit tests that operate on local, controlled data. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved. The functions under test are imported from a trusted module. The tests verify expected outputs via assertions, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
  "malware": 0.0,
