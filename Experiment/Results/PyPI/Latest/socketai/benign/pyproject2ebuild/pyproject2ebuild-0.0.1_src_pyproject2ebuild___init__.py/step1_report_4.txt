  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, possibly involving external data retrieval or computation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, external modules, and possibly user inputs (if present). Specific source points include environment variables and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writes, or execution of dynamic code, if any are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through processing functions towards sinks like network sockets, file system, or dynamic execution points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors detected. No malicious or unusual behavior observed, but the code's full context is required for certainty.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed from start to finish, focusing on imports, data handling, and function calls. No malicious behavior, such as system compromise commands, data exfiltration, or unauthorized network activity, was identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code maintains standard security practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a typical utility or processing script with no suspicious or harmful components.",
