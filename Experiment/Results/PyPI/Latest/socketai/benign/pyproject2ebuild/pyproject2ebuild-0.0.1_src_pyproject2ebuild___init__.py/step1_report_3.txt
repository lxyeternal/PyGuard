{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, likely intended for data processing or utility functions, without a clear malicious purpose.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are read from environment variables, user inputs via input() function, and possibly from external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing to console, writing to files, or network transmission if such code exists. No obvious malicious sink detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (user/env) to outputs (print/files/network), but no suspicious data flow patterns are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for security issues, including hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or backdoors. It appears straightforward, with standard library usage and no signs of malicious intent. No suspicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or malicious code injection, are present. The code structure is simple, with clear flow. No anomalies or obfuscation are detected. The overall behavior aligns with benign scripting.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, benign Python script with standard input/output operations. Based on the review, it poses a low security threat.",
