  "purpose": "The code performs standard data processing, environment variable handling, or utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, user inputs, configuration files, or standard input streams.",
  "sinks": "Writing to files, network connections, system commands, or printing outputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network or file outputs, with no suspicious or malicious pathways identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is described as standard, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies. The confidence level is high (0.9) across reports. Malware scores are consistently zero, indicating no malicious intent. Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal residual risk, possibly due to external dependencies or environment interactions. Given the absence of suspicious activity or obfuscation, the assessments are justified and align with best practices for benign code review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements detected. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the security risk scores could be conservatively lowered to zero if desired. Overall, the reports are consistent, accurate, and justified in their assessments.",
