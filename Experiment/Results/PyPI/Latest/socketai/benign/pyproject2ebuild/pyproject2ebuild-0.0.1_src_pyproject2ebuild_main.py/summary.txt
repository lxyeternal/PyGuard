  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.2) due to unverified downloads, which is typical for such tools. The minor filename typo should be corrected but does not impact security."
