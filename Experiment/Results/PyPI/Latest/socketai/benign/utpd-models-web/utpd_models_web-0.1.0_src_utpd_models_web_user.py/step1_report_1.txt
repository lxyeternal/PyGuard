  "purpose": "Define an immutable data class representing user details scraped from a web page.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, functools, pydantic.dataclasses, and utpd_models_web.injector modules.",
  "sinks": "None directly; the code only defines a data structure, no input/output or data handling that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the class only declares data fields.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom functions eq_by, hash_by, lt_by for equality, comparison, and hashing based on 'user_id'. These functions are imported but their implementation is unknown; potential concern if they perform malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class with specific fields for user details. It uses total_ordering to generate comparison methods and custom functions for equality, ordering, and hashing based on 'user_id'. The code imports modules and functions that are standard, except for 'utpd_models_web.injector' functions whose behavior is unknown. No data processing, input handling, or network operations are present. The class is a straightforward data container with no apparent malicious behavior. The only potential anomaly is the use of external functions for comparison and hashing, which could be malicious if their implementations are compromised, but without further info, this cannot be confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data class defining user details, with no obvious malicious intent. The main concern relates to the imported functions whose internal workings are unknown. Overall, the code appears benign but depends on external functions that could introduce risks if malicious.",
