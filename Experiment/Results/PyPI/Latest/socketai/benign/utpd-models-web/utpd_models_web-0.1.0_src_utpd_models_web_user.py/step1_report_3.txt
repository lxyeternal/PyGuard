{
  "purpose": "Define an immutable data structure for storing web-scraped user details.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, functools, pydantic, and utpd_models_web.injector modules. No input sources like user input or network data are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked; no external output or network calls.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class definition is static and does not process external data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom equality, comparison, and hash functions via external functions (eq_by, hash_by, lt_by). The actual implementations are not provided, which could be a concern if these functions are malicious or unsafe, but in itself, this is not suspicious without malicious context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class for user details with immutable properties and custom comparison/hash functions. No external input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The imported functions from utpd_models_web.injector are unknown but appear intended for defining object behaviors rather than executing malicious code. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident. The structure appears typical for a data container.\n\nPotential concern: reliance on external functions for equality, comparison, and hashing, but these are not inherently malicious. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data class definition for web user details with no evident malicious intent. The use of external functions for core object behaviors warrants caution if their implementations are malicious, but based solely on this code snippet, there is no indication of malware or security risks.",
