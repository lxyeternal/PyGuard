  "purpose": "Define a data class for storing user details extracted from a web page, with comparison and hashing methods based on user_id.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, functools, pydantic, and utpd_models_web.injector; class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data outputs; the code only defines a data structure.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; data is stored in an immutable class with no processing or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of custom functions eq_by, hash_by, lt_by for method definitions is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for data class creation and comparison operations. The class WebUserDetails is a frozen dataclass, indicating immutability, with fields relevant to user info. It overrides equality, less-than, and hash methods using custom functions from utpd_models_web.injector, which likely generate method implementations based on 'user_id'. There are no inputs, network calls, or external data handling in this snippet. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward data container with custom comparison logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data class defining user details with custom comparison methods. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are evident.",
