  "purpose": "Define an immutable data structure for storing web user details",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources in this code snippet",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows or potential data leaks occur",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines a class",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom eq_by, hash_by, lt_by functions suggests reliance on external implementations; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for type hints, uses functools total_ordering for comparison methods, and defines a dataclass for user details with frozen instances. Custom __eq__, __lt__, and __hash__ methods are set via external functions imported from utpd_models_web.injector, which could be designed for specific comparison or hashing logic. No input reading, network communication, or data handling is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activities. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and appears to serve as a data container without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines a data structure for web user details without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No external data handling, network activity, or potentially harmful logic is present. It appears safe and standard for a data model definition.",
