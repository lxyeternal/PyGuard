  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines an immutable data class `WebUserDetails` with user info fields.\n- Uses `total_ordering` to generate comparison methods.\n- Overrides `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` via external functions (`eq_by`, `lt_by`, `hash_by`) imported from `utpd_models_web.injector`.\n- No input/output, network calls, or data processing present.\n- The main concern is the use of external functions whose implementations are unknown.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code itself is straightforward and appears benign.\n- The only potential concern is reliance on external functions (`eq_by`, `lt_by`, `hash_by`) whose behaviors are unknown.\n- No actual malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks are evident within this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Highlights reliance on unknown functions.\n- Assigns malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n- Confidence 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; no malicious activity, just a note on external functions.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar reasoning, emphasizes lack of suspicious code.\n- Malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n- Confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same as above, emphasizes external functions and lack of malicious behavior.\n- Malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n- Confidence 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same reasoning, with emphasis on external functions.\n- Malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n- Confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly higher concern about external functions, with a security risk score of 0.3.\n- Confidence 0.6.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, but still no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign but note reliance on external functions.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting caution due to unknown external functions.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Given the reliance on external functions whose behavior is unknown, a slight concern exists, but nothing concrete suggests malicious intent. The scores of 0.1 to 0.3 are reasonable.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, mainly due to external function reliance)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, with minimal security concerns primarily about the external functions' trustworthiness.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always verify the implementation of imported functions in real scenarios. If they are malicious or compromised, they could introduce risks. But based solely on this snippet, the code is benign.",
