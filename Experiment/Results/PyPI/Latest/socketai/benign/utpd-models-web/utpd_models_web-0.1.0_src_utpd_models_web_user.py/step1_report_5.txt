  "purpose": "Define an immutable data class representing user details extracted from a web page, intended for use in web scraping applications.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, such as network or database operations, are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as there are no source-to-sink paths; this code only defines a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "Uses custom functions (eq_by, hash_by, lt_by) imported from an external module 'utpd_models_web.injector', which could potentially introduce behavior if malicious. The actual implementations of these functions are not shown, so they could potentially execute malicious code or have side effects. No other anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class for user details with fields typical for web scraping data. It imports functions for equality, hashing, and ordering operations, which are assigned to dunder methods. The code appears straightforward and standard, with no hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs visible. The only concern is the reliance on external functions whose behavior is unknown; if these functions are malicious, they could introduce risks. Since the functions are imported, the overall risk depends on their implementation. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors are detected within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily sets up a data structure with custom comparison and hashing methods, which could be benign or malicious depending on the external functions' implementation. There are no direct signs of malicious behavior or malware within this snippet itself. The main point of caution is the unknown external functions, which could potentially be malicious if not securely implemented.",
