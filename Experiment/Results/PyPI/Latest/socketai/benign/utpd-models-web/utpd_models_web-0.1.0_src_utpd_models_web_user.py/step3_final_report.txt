{
  "purpose": "Defines an immutable data class 'WebUserDetails' for storing user information scraped from a web page, with custom comparison and hashing based on 'user_id'.",
  "sources": "Imports external functions 'eq_by', 'hash_by', 'lt_by' from 'utpd_models_web.injector' used for defining equality, comparison, and hash methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The comparison and hash methods invoke external functions; data flows through these functions when instances are compared or hashed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external functions ('eq_by', 'hash_by', 'lt_by') whose implementations are unknown, which could be a potential concern if malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured data class with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks. The only point of uncertainty is the external functions used for comparison and hashing, which could be malicious if compromised. The code itself does not perform network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The reliance on external functions introduces a minimal risk, but without evidence of malicious behavior, the code appears benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data container with minimal security concern, primarily due to reliance on external functions whose safety should be verified. No malicious activity is evident, and the current scores are justified.",
