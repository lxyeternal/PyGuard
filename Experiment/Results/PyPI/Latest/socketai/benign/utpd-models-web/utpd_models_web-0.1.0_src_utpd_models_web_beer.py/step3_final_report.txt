  "purpose": "Define immutable data classes for beer-related entities used in web scraping, with comparison and hashing based on 'beer_id'.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input; uses imported comparison and hash functions from 'utpd_models_web.injector'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Data classes are static; no data flow from source to sink; only data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; TODO comment indicates incomplete field but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several immutable data classes for beer details, user history, and menu beers, utilizing external comparison and hashing helpers. No network calls, dynamic code, or data processing are present. The use of external functions appears benign. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The code is straightforward, purely structural, and aligns with safe data modeling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
