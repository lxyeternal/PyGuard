{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for representing beer details, user history, and menu beers in a web scraper context.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, datetime, functools, pydantic.dataclasses, and utpd_models_web.injector; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; data is stored in dataclass attributes. No data output or network operations are shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks are present; the code only defines data models.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors identified. Usage of __future__ import is benign. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of immutable data classes modeling beer-related entities with no functions, input/output operations, or network interactions. The use of eq_by, hash_by, lt_by functions from utpd_models_web.injector suggests custom comparison and hashing, but their implementations are not provided and seem intended for standard attribute-based behavior. The code appears standard for defining structured data objects, with no signs of malicious logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data modeling module with no evident malicious behavior, no malicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a web scraper project focused on data representation.",
