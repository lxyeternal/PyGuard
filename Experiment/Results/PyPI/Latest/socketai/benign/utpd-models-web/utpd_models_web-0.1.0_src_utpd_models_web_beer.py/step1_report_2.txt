  "purpose": "Define data structures for web-scraped beer details, user history, and menu beers.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data, only defines classes with static attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines data classes with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; the code uses standard Python features and external libraries without any malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, defines immutable data classes with comparison and hashing methods, and uses annotations for type safety. There are no functions, network calls, or data handling logic. The import 'utpd_models_web.injector' is a custom module, but without further context, it appears to provide utility functions for object comparison and hashing. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The structure is straightforward, focusing on data modeling, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data class definitions for web-scraped beer information with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
