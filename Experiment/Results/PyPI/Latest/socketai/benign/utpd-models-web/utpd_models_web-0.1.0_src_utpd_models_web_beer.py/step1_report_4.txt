  "purpose": "Define data structures for representing beer details, user history, and venue menu beers in a web scraper context.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (`datetime`, `functools`) and third-party libraries (`pydantic.dataclasses`, `utpd_models_web.injector`). No user input or external data sources are explicitly read within this code segment.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as database operations, network transmissions, or file writes are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve creation and manipulation of data class instances; no untrusted data is processed or passed to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscation, are present. The code primarily defines data classes with no complex logic or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several immutable data classes to model beer-related information, utilizing imported equality, hashing, and comparison functions. There are no input/output operations, no execution of untrusted data, and no suspicious behaviors such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, purely structural, and lacks any indication of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe, standard implementation of data structures for a web scraper application. It does not contain malicious behaviors, suspicious code, or security risks. Overall, the package or module based on this code segment is low risk.",
