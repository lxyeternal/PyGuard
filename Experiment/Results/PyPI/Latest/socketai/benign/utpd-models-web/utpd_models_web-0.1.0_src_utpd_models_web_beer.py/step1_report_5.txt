{
  "purpose": "Define data classes representing beer details, user history, and menu items for a web scraper related to beer information.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; all data fields are class attributes, likely assigned from external data sources (e.g., web scraping results).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no code writes to files, network, or executes commands based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows or processing logic; data classes only hold structured data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. Code is straightforward, using standard data class definitions with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple immutable data classes with fields representing beer and user information. Usage of imported modules like pydantic and custom eq, hash, lt functions is standard. No input validation, data sanitization, or network operations are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. Overall, the code is a typical data schema for a web scraper module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data classes modeling beer-related data for a web scraper. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no external code execution, no data leaks, or backdoors. It appears to be a legitimate part of a web scraper system, focusing solely on data structure definitions.",
