  "purpose": "Define a data structure for storing brewery details in a web-scraper application.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; no input or data reading from external sources within this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as there are no operations processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Uses imported functions eq_by, hash_by, lt_by from utpd_models_web.injector, which may perform custom operations; however, these are used to define object behavior and are not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs identified. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class WebBreweryDetails with attributes related to brewery information. It utilizes total_ordering and custom comparison/hash functions imported from an external module. There are no code execution, network operations, or data manipulation that suggest malicious intent. The imports and structure are typical for defining data objects with custom equality and ordering. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present; the code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of modeling data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data class definition for storing brewery details with custom comparison behavior. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The use of external functions for equality, hashing, and comparison is common and does not indicate security concerns.",
