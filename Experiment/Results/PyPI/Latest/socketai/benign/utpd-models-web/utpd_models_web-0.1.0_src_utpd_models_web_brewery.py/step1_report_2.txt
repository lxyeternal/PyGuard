  "purpose": "Define an immutable data class for storing brewery web page details.",
  "sources": "No input sources; all data fields are defined as class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data is written or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink within this code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external modules like utpd_models_web.injector for eq_by, hash_by, lt_by; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic; code is straightforward data class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass WebBreweryDetails with fields representing brewery information. It uses total_ordering for comparison methods and custom __eq__, __lt__, __hash__ methods imported from an external module. There are no input/output operations, network activity, or code execution beyond class definition. The code appears to be a plain data container with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or hidden logic present. The external functions eq_by, hash_by, lt_by are presumed to be utility functions for comparison and hashing, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard data class used for storing brewery details with custom comparison and hashing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
