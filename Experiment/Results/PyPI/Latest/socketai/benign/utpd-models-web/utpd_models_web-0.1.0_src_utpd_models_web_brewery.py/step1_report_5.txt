{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure for storing brewery web page details using dataclasses with comparison capabilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, functools, pydantic.dataclasses, and utpd_models_web.injector; class attributes",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no I/O, network, or data handling operations present",
  "flows": "None present; code is purely declarative with no runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic; standard use of dataclasses and comparison functions",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for annotations, class ordering, and data validation. It defines a frozen dataclass WebBreweryDetails with various fields representing brewery data. Custom comparison and hashing are set via functions imported from utpd_models_web.injector. The code is straightforward, with no data manipulation, input/output, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data class definition for brewery details with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a data container with comparison capabilities, using typical Python features and external helper functions. Overall, it appears benign and non-malicious.",
