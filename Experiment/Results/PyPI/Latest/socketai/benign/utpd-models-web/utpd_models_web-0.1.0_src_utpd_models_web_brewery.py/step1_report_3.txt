{
  "purpose": "Define an immutable data structure for storing brewery web page details.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, functools, pydantic, and utpd_models_web.injector; class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; code does not perform input/output operations or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class only defines data structure and comparison/hash methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __future__ import is standard; custom eq_by, hash_by, lt_by functions suggest tailored comparison logic, but no suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations, functools, pydantic dataclass, and custom comparison functions. It defines an immutable data class representing a brewery's webpage details with standard fields. Comparison and hash methods are assigned via external functions. No external data sources, network calls, or malicious logic are present. The code appears to be straightforward data modeling with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data class definition for storing brewery details with custom comparison logic. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
