{
  "purpose": "Define an immutable data class for brewery webpage details with custom comparison and hashing based on 'brewery_id'.",
  "sources": "The class fields are initialized with data; external functions 'eq_by', 'lt_by', 'hash_by' are used for comparison and hashing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Comparison and hashing functions operate on 'brewery_id' to establish object equality, order, and hash code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; external functions are presumed utility functions for comparison and hashing, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward, immutable data class with custom comparison and hashing functions. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. External functions are assumed benign utility functions. All reviews agree on the code's benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns support this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe data class with no malicious or security concerns. External comparison functions are presumed benign. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
