{
  "purpose": "Define an immutable data class representing brewery web page details, including identifiers, descriptive info, and a URL.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; the code solely defines a class structure.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, output, or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident since the code is only class definition with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of custom comparison and hashing functions (`eq_by`, `lt_by`, `hash_by`) from an imported module; no malicious behavior or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class with attributes for brewery details, using total_ordering for comparison operations. It relies on imported functions for equality, ordering, and hashing, which are typical in such scenarios. There are no signs of data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. No external data sources or sink points are present, and the class appears purely structural.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe data class definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any external actions or contain obfuscated code.",
