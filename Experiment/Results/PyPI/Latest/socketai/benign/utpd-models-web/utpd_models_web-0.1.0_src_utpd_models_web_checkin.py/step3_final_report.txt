  "purpose": "Data container for web-scraped beer check-in details, including user info, brewery info, and check-in metadata.",
  "sources": "Attributes initialized directly; no external data sources or input functions used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data is stored in attributes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; __str__ constructs summaries locally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard library usage and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an immutable data class with attributes for check-in info, using external comparison and hashing functions presumed safe. The __str__ method generates a descriptive string. No network, dynamic code, or obfuscation detected. External functions are assumed benign. No secrets or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data class with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
