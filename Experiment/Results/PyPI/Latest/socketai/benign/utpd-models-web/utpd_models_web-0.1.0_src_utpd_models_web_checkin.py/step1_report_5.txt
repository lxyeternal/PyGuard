  "purpose": "Defines a data class representing a user's check-in activity for beers, including attributes and string representation.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, datetime module, functools, pydantic.dataclasses, and utpd_models_web.injector; class attributes and methods.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not process untrusted input, perform I/O, or send data externally.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow to external systems; class primarily stores data and creates string summaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious logic, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class 'WebActivityBeer' with attributes representing beer check-in details, including optional fields. It includes a string method to generate summaries. The class uses imported functions for equality, ordering, and hashing based on 'checkin_id'. There is no code executing external commands, network operations, or handling sensitive data insecurely. All imports are standard or library functions. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data container for web check-in information with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely provides structure and string formatting functionality.",
