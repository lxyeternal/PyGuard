  "review": "Let's analyze this systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\nAll reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response content. Therefore, there are no specific issues, errors, or vulnerabilities described in these reports. Without additional details, I cannot identify any flaws, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors based solely on the provided code snippet.\n\n**Step 2: Review the code for potential issues**\n\n- The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a `Location` dataclass with a distance calculation method.\n- The `distance_from` method uses a cached `haversine` function, which wraps the original `haversine` function from the `haversine` library.\n- The caching via `lru_cache` is appropriate for repeated distance calculations between the same coordinate pairs, which can improve performance.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the scores and reasoning**\n\nSince no reports provide details, I will assess the potential risks based on the code:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (nothing malicious is evident; no code injection, no suspicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (the code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no vulnerabilities or security issues are apparent)\n\n**Step 4: Check for logical flaws or mistakes**\n\n- The code imports `astuple` from `dataclasses`, but in Python's `dataclasses` module, the function is named `astuple()` in Python 3.10+. Assuming the environment supports it, this is fine.\n- The `@lru_cache` decorator is used on the `haversine` function. Since the function takes a tuple of floats, caching is effective.\n- The `distance_from` method correctly calls the cached `haversine`.\n\n**Step 5: Final assessment**\n\nGiven the absence of detailed reports and the straightforward nature of the code, I conclude:\n\n- **No issues are present in the code.**\n- **Scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type        | Estimated Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score     | 0.0               | No malicious activity or code behavior present.           |\n| Obfuscated Score  | 0.0               | Code is clear and understandable.                          |\n| Risk Score        | 0.0               | No vulnerabilities or security concerns evident.          |\n\n**Final note:** Without additional context or specific reports, the code appears safe and well-implemented.",
