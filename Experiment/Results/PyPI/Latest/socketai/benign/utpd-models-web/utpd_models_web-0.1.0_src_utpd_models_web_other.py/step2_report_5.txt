  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Review:**\n\n- The code defines a `Location` dataclass with `lat` and `lng` attributes, which is standard.\n- The `distance_from` method correctly uses the `haversine` function to compute the distance between two locations.\n- The `haversine` function is wrapped with `lru_cache` for caching, which is efficient.\n- The `haversine_orig` function imported from the `haversine` package is used as the core calculation.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n\n- The code appears correct syntactically and logically.\n- The `astuple` function is imported but used correctly.\n- No obvious vulnerabilities or malicious code present.\n- The caching decorator is correctly applied to the wrapper function.\n\n**2. Review of the reports:**\n\n- All reports indicate `\"error\": \"Empty response\"` with no raw response data.\n- No specific details or context are provided about the nature of the incident or vulnerabilities.\n\n**3. Logical flaws or errors:**\n\n- Since the reports contain no substantive data, there's no evidence of errors or malicious activity.\n- The code does not seem to contain any logic flaws or vulnerabilities based on the provided snippet.\n\n**4. Scores and risk assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and correctness, and no evidence of issues, the risk score should be low, around 0.0 to 0.1.\n\n**5. Additional considerations:**\n\n- The reports are empty, so there's no indication of actual security incidents.\n- If these reports are placeholders or incomplete, no action is needed.\n- If the reports are accurate, then no vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct, with no errors or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for minimal risk due to potential future issues, but currently very low)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nBased on the provided code and reports, there are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The reports are empty, so no further action or suspicion is warranted. The scores should reflect this.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis conservative risk score accounts for the lack of evidence but leaves room for future issues if more data becomes available.",
