  "purpose": "Defines a Location data structure with latitude and longitude, and computes haversine distance between locations.",
  "sources": "Input data from Location instances' lat and lng attributes.",
  "sinks": "The distance_from method uses untrusted data if Location instances are created with malicious inputs; however, no direct sink for data leaks or external effects exists.",
  "flows": "Location.lat/lng -> distance_from() -> haversine() -> haversine_orig",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward. The use of astuple assumes Python 3.10+; no validation of coordinate ranges is performed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple immutable Location class with a method to compute distance using the haversine formula, cached for efficiency. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The only potential concern is the reliance on Python 3.10+ for astuple and lack of input validation, but these are not security vulnerabilities. The reports are empty, indicating no issues found. The code is clean, correct, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The lack of input validation is a robustness concern but not security-related. Scores are malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1 to reflect minimal potential for issues due to missing validation.",
