  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Code input, data handling sections, network operations, environment variable access, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file system modifications, environment variable usage, data output functions.",
  "flows": "Input sources to data processing or network transmission points, potential data exfiltration or malicious command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns; limited code context.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies. Malware scores are consistently 0, reflecting no malicious intent. Security risk scores are low (0.2), indicating minimal concern, justified by the benign descriptions. Confidence levels are moderate to high where code exists, appropriate given the limited code snippets. No significant discrepancies or unjustified scores are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scoring is consistent and justified. No modifications are necessary. The dependency can be considered safe based on current analysis.",
