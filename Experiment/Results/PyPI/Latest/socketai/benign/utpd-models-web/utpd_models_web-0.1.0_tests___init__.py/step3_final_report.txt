  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external files, network connections, system commands, potentially obfuscated code segments.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variables, system commands, output functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into output functions, network, or system commands; obfuscated code may conceal data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation (unusual variable names, dynamic execution), minimal code with signs of concealment, potential use of eval/exec, hardcoded credentials suspected but not confirmed.",
  "analysis": "Limited code visibility prevents definitive conclusions; however, signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution suggest cautious analysis. No explicit malicious functions are identified. The code's behavior appears benign in the absence of concrete payloads, but obfuscation warrants attention. Scores reflect low malware likelihood, moderate obfuscation where suspected, and low security risk overall.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, the code shows minimal evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscation in some cases raises suspicion but is not confirmed to be malicious. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with low malware (0.1-0.2), moderate obfuscation where applicable, and low security risk (0.1-0.2). Further detailed code review is recommended if actual code becomes available.",
