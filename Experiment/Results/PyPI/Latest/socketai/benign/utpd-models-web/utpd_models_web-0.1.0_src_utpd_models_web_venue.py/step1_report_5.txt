  "purpose": "Define data structures for storing venue and user history details related to web scraping of venue information.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, datetime, functools, pydantic.dataclasses, and local modules utpd_models_web.injector and utpd_models_web.other.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily defines classes and properties without performing any data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no data processing or external communication occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard Python features, data class patterns, and property methods. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two immutable data classes for storing venue information and user history, using common Python idioms and type hints. It imports from trusted libraries and local modules for equality, hashing, and comparison methods. No functions perform I/O, network access, or execute dynamic code. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard data structure definitions for managing venue data, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for use within a larger application that handles web scraping and data storage.",
