{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for representing user venue history and venue details in a web scraper context.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (datetime), third-party libraries (pydantic, utpd_models_web). No external input reading evident within the code.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external communication such as network requests, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows appear limited to object instantiation and property access; no untrusted data processing or transfer mechanisms shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious code structures, no dynamic code execution, no unusual variables or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data class definitions with standard annotations, property methods, and custom comparison/hash functions. It imports modules for data modeling and utility functions for equality, hashing, and ordering. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The use of pydantic for data validation and the clear, straightforward data models do not exhibit malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data models for web venue information and user history, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and legitimate, with no suspicious patterns.",
