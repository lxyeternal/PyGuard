{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for representing user venue history and venue details in a web-scraping context.",
  "sources": "Imports from pydantic, utpd_models_web.injector, utpd_models_web.other; class attributes and properties.",
  "sinks": "Return statement in activity_url property, potential data manipulation within class methods.",
  "flows": "Class attributes and methods do not process untrusted input directly; data flows are limited to attribute access and URL construction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual logic found.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data classes with equality, comparison, and hash functions. It imports modules that may provide utility functions for comparison and hashing, but these are used as class method definitions only. The activity_url property constructs URLs based on the verified status, which is straightforward and safe. No code injection, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. There are no external input sources or data processing that could lead to security issues. Overall, the code appears to be standard data modeling with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of data structures for venue information with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
