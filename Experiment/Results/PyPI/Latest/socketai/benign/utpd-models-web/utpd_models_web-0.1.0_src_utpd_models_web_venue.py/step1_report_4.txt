  "purpose": "Define data structures for representing user venue history and venue details in a web scraper.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attributes, property method",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no I/O, network, or database operations present",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks; data flow is contained within class attributes and property",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns observed. Use of third-party libraries is standard for data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two dataclasses: WebUserHistoryVenue and WebVenueDetails, with attributes representing venue information. The code uses third-party libraries like pydantic for data validation and custom functions for equality, comparison, and hashing. The property method constructs URLs based on the verified status, which is standard behavior. No input handling, external data reading, or network communication is present within this code fragment. No suspicious or malicious constructs, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard data modeling for a web scraper, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily handles data representation with no external data input or output within this snippet, and no malicious patterns are detected.",
