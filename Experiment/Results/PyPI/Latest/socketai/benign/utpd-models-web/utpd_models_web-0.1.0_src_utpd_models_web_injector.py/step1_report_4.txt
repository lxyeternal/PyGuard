  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to inject equality, ordering, and hashing methods into classes based on a specified attribute.",
  "sources": "Function definitions and local inner functions that generate method implementations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No external data flow; the code dynamically creates methods for classes based on a specified field.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; commented-out class code is benign and seems to be a placeholder or alternative implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines higher-order functions that generate methods for class behaviors (equality, less-than comparison, hash) based on a given attribute. It uses standard Python features and type hints, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The commented class indicates alternative design but is benign. Overall, the code appears to be a standard utility module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility for injecting methods into classes for comparison and hashing purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
