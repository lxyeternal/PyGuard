{
  "purpose": "Provide decorators for injecting equality, less-than, and hash methods into classes based on specified fields.",
  "sources": "Function definitions, string literals, import statements, commented-out class code.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external output; no external network or system calls present.",
  "flows": "User-defined field names are passed into functions, but only used internally for method creation; no external data flow or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The commented-out class code may suggest unfinished or placeholder code but is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines factory functions to create comparison and hash methods based on a given attribute. It uses standard Python features, such as 'getattr' and type checks. No dynamic code execution, external calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The commented-out class does not pose an active threat but might be an incomplete or placeholder implementation. Overall, the code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides utility functions for injecting common methods into classes and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign and intended for use as a helper module for class method injection.",
