{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to inject equality, ordering, and hashing methods into classes based on specified fields.",
  "sources": "Defines functions eq_by, lt_by, and hash_by that generate methods; no external data input or file reads.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data leaks, network communication, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Generated methods compare or hash object attributes, used within class instances; no external flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns; commented-out class code appears benign, possibly for documentation or future use.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for injecting standard methods into classes based on attribute names. These functions create comparison and hash methods that operate solely on specified fields, with no external input, network activity, or system modification. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The commented-out class seems intended for identity-based comparisons, but is inactive and non-malicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be purely utility functions for class method injection with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any harmful actions, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. Overall, it is safe from a security perspective.",
