  "purpose": "Define a data model for a venue's menu, including properties and comparison methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party libraries, and local modules; class attributes and methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "Data is stored in class attributes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a data class with attributes for menu details and comparison methods. It uses standard and third-party libraries for data validation and ordering. No external input handling or data output mechanisms are present. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is evident. The class is a simple model with properties and equality/hash implementations based on 'menu_id'.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured data model with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It does not process untrusted data directly, nor does it contain malicious behaviors.",
