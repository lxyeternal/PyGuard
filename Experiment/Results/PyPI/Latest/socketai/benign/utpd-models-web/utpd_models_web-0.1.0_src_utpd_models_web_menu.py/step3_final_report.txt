{
  "purpose": "Defines a data model for a venue's menu, including comparison and hashing based on menu_id.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; class attributes are static or defaulted.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; purely a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, immutable data class representing a venue menu with comparison and hash methods based on menu_id. It imports external modules for data validation and comparison but does not process external input or perform dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The class attributes and methods are standard for data modeling. External dependencies are not inherently suspicious unless malicious, which is outside this code snippet's scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data model with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score of 0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
