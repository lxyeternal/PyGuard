  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from environment variables, user input, or code execution points such as eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writes, or data exfiltration points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or user input to sinks such as network or file systems, potentially via dynamic execution or hardcoded secrets.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns without confirmed malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code in question shows varying levels of suspicion. Reports 1, 2, 4, and 5 indicate benign, straightforward code with no malicious patterns, justified by zero malware and obfuscation scores and low security risks. Report 3 presents signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, and hardcoded secrets, raising suspicion. The original malware score of 0.4 underestimates the risk; given the patterns, a higher score around 0.6 is more appropriate. Obfuscation is high (0.8), consistent with the suspicion. The security risk score of 0.6 aligns with the potential for malicious intent but lacks confirmed malicious activity. Confidence levels are high across reports, with slight adjustments recommended for Report 3 to better reflect suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with justified low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 3's suspicious patterns warrant raising the malware score from 0.4 to approximately 0.6, reflecting increased concern. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low to moderate depending on the suspicion level. No definitive malicious activity is confirmed, but patterns suggest further review for Report 3.",
