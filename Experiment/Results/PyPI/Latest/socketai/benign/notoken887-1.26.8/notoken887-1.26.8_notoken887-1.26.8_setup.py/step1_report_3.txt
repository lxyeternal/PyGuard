  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Reading package data from setup() parameters, including package discovery, author info, description, URL, classifiers, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of the 'notoken887.main:main' function via console script, which could execute arbitrary code if malicious.",
  "flows": "User installs the package, triggers 'notoken887' CLI, which runs 'notoken887.main:main' entry point.",
  "anomalies": "Author email uses a provocative name, URL is suspicious ('https://thugging.org'), and description states it's an obfuscation test library. No malicious code or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package info, author details, description, URL, and entry points. No code logic or execution is embedded beyond package configuration. The URL and email are potentially suspicious but do not directly indicate malicious intent within this setup script. No obfuscated or malicious code, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors, and no suspicious flows or anomalies other than possibly provocative metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script with questionable metadata but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious code flows.",
