  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and functions as intended. The suspicious metadata (author email and URL) raises red flags but does not constitute malicious code or obfuscation. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The security risk score can be slightly elevated due to metadata concerns but remains low overall."
