{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple encoding and decoding (obfuscation) of strings by replacing characters with emoji-based equivalents.",
  "sources": "Input data is the string parameter in 'encrypt' and the encrypted_token parameter in 'decrypt' methods.",
  "sinks": "The code replaces characters within the input strings; no external data sinks are present. No network or file operations are observed.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through character replacement in 'encrypt' to produce obfuscated output, and vice versa in 'decrypt'.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward character replacement without any encryption, decryption keys, or external communication. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscation beyond simple replacements. No dynamic code execution or hidden logic. The code is structured as a static class with explicit character mappings.",
  "analysis": "The class performs character substitutions to obfuscate and de-obfuscate strings, which is a basic encoding technique. It does not include any malicious payloads, network activities, or system modifications. The absence of external data handling, cryptographic operations, or secret management indicates low risk. The method is purely for obfuscation, not security. No anomalies such as hidden backdoors or malicious behavior are identified. The code is straightforward and self-contained.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple character substitution cipher using emoji mappings for obfuscation. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or supply chain attacks. It functions solely for obfuscation purposes without performing any harmful actions.",
