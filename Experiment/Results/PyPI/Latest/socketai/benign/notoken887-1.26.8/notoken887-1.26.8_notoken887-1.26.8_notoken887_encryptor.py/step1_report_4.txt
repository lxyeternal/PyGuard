{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple obfuscation and de-obfuscation of strings by replacing characters with emoji-based tokens.",
  "sources": "Input strings to encrypt() and encrypted strings to decrypt().",
  "sinks": "Output of encrypt() and decrypt() methods, which could be used to obscure malicious payloads or data.",
  "flows": "Input string → encrypt() replaces characters with emojis → output string; Encrypted string → decrypt() reverses emojis to characters → output string.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward character replacements without any validation, logging, or external interactions. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No unusual or obfuscated logic; the method is purely character mapping.",
  "analysis": "The class defines two methods that perform direct character replacement to encode and decode strings using a predefined emoji mapping. Both methods are symmetric, ensuring reversibility. No external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are present. The replacement maps are static and consistent, indicating a simple encoding scheme. The purpose appears to be obfuscation or playful encoding rather than malicious activity. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. The code is structurally straightforward with no signs of obfuscation beyond the use of emojis, which are part of the design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character-mapping class used for string obfuscation. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions, data leaks, or external communications. Its simplicity and symmetry suggest it is intended for playful or obfuscation purposes rather than malicious intent.",
