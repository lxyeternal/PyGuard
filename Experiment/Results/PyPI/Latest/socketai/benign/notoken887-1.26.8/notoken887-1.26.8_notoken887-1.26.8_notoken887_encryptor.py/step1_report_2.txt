{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode (encrypt) and decode (decrypt) strings by replacing characters with emoji-based tokens and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings in the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, accepting data for transformation.",
  "sinks": "The methods output transformed strings; there are no external data sinks or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed to 'encrypt', which replaces characters with emojis; the output is the emoji-encoded string. Conversely, 'decrypt' takes the emoji string and reverses the replacements back to original characters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. The code appears to be straightforward character-to-emoji substitution without hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The class performs simple character replacement for encoding and decoding. No external data access, network operations, or system modifications are present. The methods do not process untrusted input beyond character substitution, and there are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code structure is clear, with symmetric replacement tables for encoding and decoding. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a basic reversible character substitution cipher using emojis. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve as an encoding tool rather than malware or a security threat.",
