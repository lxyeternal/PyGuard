{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides simple substitution-based methods to encrypt and decrypt strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The methods read input strings in 'encrypt' and 'decrypt'. No external data sources or inputs are present in the code itself.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs are the transformed strings; no direct data leaks or external calls are evident within this code.",
  "flows": "Input string -> substitution mapping in 'encrypt' -> output encrypted string; then encrypted string -> substitution mapping in 'decrypt' -> original string.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs a straightforward character replacement cipher without any cryptographic security; no external network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious functions are present. The substitution appears static and simple.",
  "analysis": "The code performs character-by-character substitution for encryption and decryption using hardcoded emoji mappings. No external input/output beyond method parameters. No use of external libraries, no dynamic execution, no code injection, no network calls, no hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The pattern is simplistic and serves only as a basic obfuscation or encoding scheme, not as a secure cryptographic method. There are no suspicious or malicious code elements, and the logic is clear and limited to character replacement.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation of a simple substitution cipher using emojis for encoding. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. Its security level is very low, and it does not pose a threat. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
