  "purpose": "Initialize and bootstrap a message bus system with optional dependencies and configurations, including database session, engine, user context, and handlers.",
  "sources": "Function parameters providing configuration data; external modules/functions like bootstrap_abstrato and UnidadeDeTrabalhoBase",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no network or file operations observed",
  "flows": "Parameters flow from function arguments into object instantiations and into the bootstrap_abstrato call",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward dependency injection and configuration pattern, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard bootstrap utility for setting up a messaging system, relying on external modules assumed to be safe. It conditionally creates a unit of work object if none is provided, then calls an external bootstrap function with the configured objects. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage points are present. The code's clarity and simplicity suggest no malicious intent. External dependencies are assumed safe, but their trustworthiness is outside this code snippet. The code does not process untrusted data directly, nor does it perform any risky operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard initialization routine for a messaging system, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
