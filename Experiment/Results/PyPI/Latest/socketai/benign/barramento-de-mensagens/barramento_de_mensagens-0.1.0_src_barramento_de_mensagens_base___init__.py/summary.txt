  "malware_score": 0.6,
  "security_risk": 0.55,
  "obfuscated": 0.65,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that the most suspicious code (Report 3) warrants a higher malware score (~0.6) due to obfuscation and dynamic eval usage. Other reports are consistent with their assessments. No evidence of confirmed malicious activity is present, but the obfuscation and dynamic techniques justify cautious scoring. The overall security risk remains low to moderate, with most code appearing benign. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the signals, with no need for significant adjustments."
