  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class 'DominioBase' with potential future enum members.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not output data or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since no data is read or written.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ellipsis (...) in class body; may indicate incomplete implementation but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum and defines a class 'DominioBase' inheriting from Enum. The class body contains only an ellipsis, suggesting a placeholder or incomplete implementation. There are no input/output operations, no usage of untrusted data, and no malicious constructs observed. The code appears to be a stub for future enum members. No security issues, malware, or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple stub for an enumeration class with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears incomplete or a placeholder, with no signs of malicious behavior or security concerns.",
