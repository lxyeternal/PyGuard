{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class named DominioBase, likely intended for categorizing or managing domain-related constants or types.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; only class definition with an import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external system interactions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code does not process any data.",
  "anomalies": "The class contains only a placeholder '...' instead of actual enum members, which is unusual but not malicious. The commented line suggests intended future implementation or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum but does not define any actual enum members, only a placeholder '...'. The comment hints at possible future members related to user repositories, but currently, the code does not perform any operations, data handling, or include suspicious patterns. The absence of real implementation makes it unlikely to contain malicious code or backdoors. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is evident. The minimal code is benign but incomplete.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple placeholder for an Enum class with no active functionality. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks but appears unfinished or intentionally minimal. No security concerns are present in this fragment.",
