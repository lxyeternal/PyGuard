  "purpose": "Placeholder enum class with no defined members, serving as a scaffold for future implementation.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; class definition with '...' as body.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external interactions; code is inert.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow; class body contains only an ellipsis.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '...' (Ellipsis) in class body, indicating incomplete code or template.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum subclass with an incomplete body using '...'. It contains no enum members, no data flows, no input/output, and no suspicious or malicious constructs. The use of '...' is typical for placeholder code, not malicious activity. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign, incomplete nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, incomplete stub with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are consistent with its nature. No adjustments are necessary; it poses no threat.",
