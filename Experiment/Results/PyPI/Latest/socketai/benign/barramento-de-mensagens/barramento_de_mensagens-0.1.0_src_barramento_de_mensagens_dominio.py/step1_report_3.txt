{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class 'DominioBase' with potential placeholder for enumeration members.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '...' as class body indicates incomplete code or placeholder, which is unusual in finalized code but common in stubs or templates.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum from the enum module and defines a class 'DominioBase' inheriting from Enum. The class contains a commented-out line suggesting a member 'usuario' with some tuple value. The class body only contains '...' (ellipsis), which is often used as a placeholder for incomplete implementation. There is no actual executable code, data handling, or logic that could be malicious. The pattern suggests an unfinished or template code structure. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a stub or placeholder for an enumeration class, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is incomplete but not malicious.",
