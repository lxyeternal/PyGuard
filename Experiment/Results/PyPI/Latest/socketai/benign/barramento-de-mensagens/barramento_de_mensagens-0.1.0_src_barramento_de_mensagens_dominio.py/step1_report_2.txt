{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class 'DominioBase' that likely represents domain-specific constants or categories.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions affecting data security.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks due to lack of input or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '...' (Ellipsis) suggests incomplete code; no actual implementation, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum and declares a class 'DominioBase' extending Enum, but the class body is incomplete, indicated by '...'. There are no variables, methods, or data members defined. The comment hints at possible intended members, but they are not present. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of Ellipsis is typical in stub or placeholder code, not malicious code. The code fragment appears to be a partial or template code with no functional security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is an incomplete class declaration with no active logic, no malicious code, and no security risks identified. It appears to be a placeholder for further implementation.",
