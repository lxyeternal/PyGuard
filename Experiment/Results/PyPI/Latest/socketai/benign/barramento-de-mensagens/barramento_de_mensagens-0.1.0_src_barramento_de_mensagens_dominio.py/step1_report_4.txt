  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class 'DominioBase' intended to represent a set of constant values or states.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines a class.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; no input or output processing in the code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ellipsis (...) indicates incomplete implementation; no malicious or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum and declares a class inheriting from Enum. The class contains a commented line and an ellipsis indicating incomplete code. No functions, data processing, external input, or sensitive operations are present. The presence of '...' suggests the code is a stub or a placeholder, not executing any logic or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal class definition with no active logic, no data handling, and no malicious indicators. It appears to be an incomplete or placeholder class. No malicious behavior or security issues are identified.",
