  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code manages database sessions, schema creation, and repositories within an async context manager. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is standard infrastructure.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, code obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate given the reliance on external functions, but no direct issues.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on external dependencies like `criar_schema_completo_dentro_de_uma_transacao` and `sql_session_factory`. No malicious behavior observed.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The reasoning correctly notes external dependencies as potential vectors but assumes they are safe.\n- No malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- The risk score is appropriate, considering external function trust.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, standard async context manager for database sessions and schema creation, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The reasoning is consistent; the code is straightforward.\n- The low risk score reflects minimal concern, which is justified.\n- External dependencies are assumed safe.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to previous reports, focusing on dependency injection and session management, with no malicious signs.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The analysis correctly identifies the code as standard.\n- No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- External functions are assumed safe.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a typical async session handler with schema creation and repository setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n- No signs of malicious intent.\n- External dependencies are assumed trustworthy.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score**: Slight variation, mostly around 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal concern due to external dependencies but no inherent vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n- **Malware**: **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated**: **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk**: **0.1-0.2** — appropriate given the external dependencies and schema creation features.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.15\n\nThis aligns with the consensus that the code is standard infrastructure with no malicious or obfuscated content, and a very low security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The reports are consistent and reasonable. No modifications needed. The code appears secure, clear, and standard for its purpose.",
