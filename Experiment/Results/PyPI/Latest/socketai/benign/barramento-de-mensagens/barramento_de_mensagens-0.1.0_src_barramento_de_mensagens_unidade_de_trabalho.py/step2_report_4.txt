  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code is a typical async context manager for database sessions, with optional schema creation and repository setup.\n- External functions like `criar_schema_completo_dentro_de_uma_transacao` and `sql_session_factory` are used, but their implementations are not provided; their safety is assumed.\n- No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are detected.\n- The malware scores are consistently zero across reports, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are identified in the code snippet.\n- **Logic flaws or mistakes:** No evident logical errors or security flaws.\n- **External dependencies:** Rely on external functions which, if compromised, could pose risks, but within this code, they are assumed safe.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None observed; no network, file, or data exfiltration patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations on Scores:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 unless external functions are compromised, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0 (0.1-0.2) reflects minimal inherent risk; this is reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n### Justification for Higher Risk Scores:\n- Since the code is standard infrastructure code, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified unless external dependencies are known to be malicious. Given no such evidence, the current low scores are appropriate.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' assessments and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, typical infrastructure code risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious intent. The current scores are justified and should remain as such unless external dependencies are compromised.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' assessments. No changes to scores are necessary. The code is a typical, well-structured async database session manager with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
