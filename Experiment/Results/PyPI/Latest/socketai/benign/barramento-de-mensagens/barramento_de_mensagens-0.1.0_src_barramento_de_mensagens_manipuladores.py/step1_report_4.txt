  "purpose": "Define type aliases for event and command handlers in a messaging system.",
  "sources": "Import statements for type annotations and classes from a messaging library.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; code only defines types.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type alias definitions without dynamic code execution or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary types for type annotations and defines new type aliases for handler mappings. It uses Python's typing features such as NewType and type hints. There is no input reading, no data processing, no execution of untrusted data, nor any suspicious logic. The code appears to be a standard part of a larger messaging framework setup, solely for type safety and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple type alias definition for handler mappings, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves as type annotations for clearer code in a larger application.",
