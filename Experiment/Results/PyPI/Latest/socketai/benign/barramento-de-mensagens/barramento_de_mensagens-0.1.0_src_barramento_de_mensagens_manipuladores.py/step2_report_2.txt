  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code.**  \nThe code is straightforward: it imports type hints and classes Evento and Comando, then defines two type aliases using NewType. There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, or external interactions.\n\n**Step 2: Check for errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning.**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is purely for type aliasing and does not perform any runtime logic, data handling, or malicious activities. They also note the unusual use of NewType for complex dictionary types, but correctly conclude that this is not suspicious.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue.**  \n- Confidence: All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the clarity and simplicity of the code.  \n- Obfuscated: All reports assign 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.  \n- Malware: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- Security Risk: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Step 4: Justify higher risk scores if any.**  \nSince the code is purely for type aliasing and involves no runtime execution, data processing, or external data, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted. The same applies to malware scores.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions.**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions and correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n**Step 6: Check for consistency between scores and analysis.**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — correct, no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports — correct, code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 for all reports — appropriate, given the code's nature.\n\n### My own estimate after review:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, safe setup for type annotations in a messaging system. No malicious or suspicious activity is present, and the scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo changes needed; all reports are accurate in their assessment.",
