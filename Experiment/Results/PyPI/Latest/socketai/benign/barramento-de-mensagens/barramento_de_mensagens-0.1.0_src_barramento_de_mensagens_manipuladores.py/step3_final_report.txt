  "purpose": "Define type aliases for event and command handler mappings using Python's NewType for type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from barramento_de_mensagens.base.barramento: Evento, Comando",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data handling",
  "flows": "None; purely type alias definitions",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of NewType for complex dictionary types, but not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes Evento and Comando, then defines two type aliases using NewType: one for a dictionary mapping event types to lists of callables, and another for a dictionary mapping command types to a single callable. There are no runtime behaviors, data manipulations, or external interactions. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The use of NewType for complex types is unconventional but not malicious. The code serves as a static type setup for a messaging system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and intended for type safety. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
