  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the original code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code only defines type aliases for event and command handlers.\n- No data processing, external inputs, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n- The code relies on standard Python typing features and external class references, but does not instantiate or manipulate data.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code imports `Evento` and `Comando` classes, but does not instantiate or process them.\n- The use of `NewType` for complex dictionary types is noted as unusual but not suspicious.\n- No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Scores and conclusions:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- Security risk: 0, given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- The reports' assessments seem accurate and reasonable.\n- The high confidence scores (1) are justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No changes needed in the scores.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0, since no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code is purely definitional and safe.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\nThis code is a standard, safe setup for type annotations in a message-driven architecture. It does not process untrusted data, does not execute dynamic code, and contains no malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis supply chain component is safe, with no security issues detected.",
