  "purpose": "Define type aliases for event and command handlers in a messaging system.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing module and barramento_de_mensagens.base.barramento",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data processing or output present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code only defines types",
  "anomalies": "Use of NewType for complex dictionary types is unusual but not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports type hints and defines new type aliases for message event and command handlers, mapping event types to lists of callables and command types to a single callable. There are no input sources or output sinks, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be part of a larger framework setup for message handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type alias definition for a message handling framework, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up type annotations for clarity and type safety.",
