{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for event and command handlers using NewType, facilitating structured handling of Evento and Comando objects.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'typing' and 'barramento_de_mensagens' modules, which provide Evento and Comando classes, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code mainly defines type aliases and imports, with no data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only sets type aliases without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type-related utilities from 'typing' and references classes Evento and Comando from an external module. It then defines two type aliases for handler collections: one mapping event types to lists of callables, and another mapping command types to single callables, using NewType for type safety. There are no dynamic code executions, data manipulations, or network interactions, and no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines structured type aliases for event and command handler mappings, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a straightforward, safe setup for event-driven code organization.",
