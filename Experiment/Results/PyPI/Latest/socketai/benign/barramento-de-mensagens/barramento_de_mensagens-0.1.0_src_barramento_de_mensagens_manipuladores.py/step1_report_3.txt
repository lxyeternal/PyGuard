  "purpose": "Define type aliases for event and command handlers in a message bus system.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' module and 'barramento_de_mensagens.base.barramento' module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of NewType for complex data structures is unusual but not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes type aliases for handler dictionaries mapping event and command types to their respective callables. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are processed. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard type annotation practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple type alias declaration for handler mappings in an event-driven system. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
