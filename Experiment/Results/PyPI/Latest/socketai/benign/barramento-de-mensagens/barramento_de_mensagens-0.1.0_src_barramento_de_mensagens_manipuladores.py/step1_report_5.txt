  "purpose": "Define type aliases for event and command handler mappings in a messaging system.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations, especially no handling of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows are present; this is just type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type annotations and defines new types using NewType for organizing event and command handlers as dictionaries. It references external classes Evento and Comando but does not instantiate or manipulate data. No dynamic execution, external inputs, or sensitive information handling occurs. The code appears to be part of a larger system setup, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, harmless type alias definition for handler mappings. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
