  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described behavior with the provided code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a dependency injection setup for a message bus system, wrapping handlers with async functions that log after execution.\n- It uses standard Python features: `inspect.signature()`, `functools.wraps`, and async functions.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The message parameter is passed directly into handlers; the code does not perform any external network or file operations.\n- The logging is benign, only indicating message handling completion.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose:** Describes setting up dependency injection and async handling—accurate.\n\n**Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly identifies standard patterns, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0.2 — Slightly elevated but justified due to the async wrapper and dependency injection, which are standard. The report's low risk score seems reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, focuses on dependency injection setup.\n\n**Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly notes standard practices, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0.2 — Appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose:** Same as above, with emphasis on handler setup.\n\n**Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly identifies standard dependency injection, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0.1 — Slightly lower, consistent with minimal risk.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose:** Focuses on message processing and potential data leakage.\n\n**Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly states that the only sink is logging, which is benign.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0.1 — Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose:** Similar to others, emphasizing dependency injection.\n\n**Analysis & conclusion:** Correct, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0.1 — Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard dependency injection and message handler setup.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior observed.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to async wrappers and dependency injection, which are standard patterns.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.",
