{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and injects dependencies into message handlers for a message bus system, facilitating command and event handling with dependency injection and asynchronous execution.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules and functions, accesses dependencies, and inspects handler function signatures.",
  "sinks": "Calls to the handler functions with message data, logging statements, and return statements.",
  "flows": "Input data (messages) are passed to injected handlers through the async_wrapper; handlers may utilize injected dependencies; logging captures the processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code detected. The dependency injection and async wrapper appear standard. No unusual or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency injection by inspecting handler parameters and wrapping handlers in an async wrapper that logs after execution. It constructs a message bus with injected handlers, preserving standard async handling. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious constructs are apparent. The code structure and functions follow typical patterns for dependency injection and message handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of dependency injection and message handler setup without malicious intent. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on the provided code segment.",
