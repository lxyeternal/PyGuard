  "purpose": "Setup dependency injection for message handlers, wrapping them in async functions that log after execution.",
  "sources": "Handler functions receiving messages; the 'message' parameter passed into handlers.",
  "sinks": "Logging output indicating message handling completion.",
  "flows": "Handler functions invoked with message parameter; post-processing logs executed after handler completion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard use of inspect.signature and async wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a dependency injection pattern for message handlers, wrapping each handler in an async function that logs after execution. It uses standard Python features without obfuscation or malicious patterns. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The use of inspect.signature ensures dependencies are injected correctly based on handler signatures. The logging is benign and limited to informational messages. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign setup for dependency injection in a message bus system. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the security risk is minimal. The existing scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
