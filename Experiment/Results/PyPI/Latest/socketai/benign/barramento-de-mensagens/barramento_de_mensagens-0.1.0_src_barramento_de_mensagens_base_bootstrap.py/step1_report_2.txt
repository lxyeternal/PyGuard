{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to bootstrap message handling with dependency injection, specifically for commands and events in a messaging system.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, imported modules, and the inspect.signature() function to analyze handler parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the injected handlers which execute asynchronously, and the logger.info call within the async_wrapper.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dependencies dictionary into handlers via injected_deps; messages are passed into handlers which are wrapped by async_wrapper for logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. The code uses standard Python features and libraries. No suspicious network or system calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up message handlers with dependency injection, wrapping them with asynchronous functions that log message handling completion. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. Usage of inspect for parameter analysis and functools.wraps is standard. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard dependency injection setup for message handlers in a messaging system. It does not contain malware, suspicious data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The overall security risk is minimal.",
