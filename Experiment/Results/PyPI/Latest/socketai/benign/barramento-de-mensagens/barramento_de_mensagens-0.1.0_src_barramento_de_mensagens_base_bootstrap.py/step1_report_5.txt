{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up and initialize message bus infrastructure with dependency injection for command and event handlers in a messaging system.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from function parameters (uow, command_handlers, event_handlers, subir_erros_de_eventos, permitir_execucoes_assincronas), and dependencies dictionary. It inspects handler functions via inspect.signature to determine dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows from message objects (Comando | Evento) passed to async_wrapper, and possibly logs via logger.info. No other external or network data sink is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from message parameter into handler functions via inject_dependencies, with dependencies injected from a controlled dictionary. No external or untrusted sources directly influence the flow beyond message parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code employs standard dependency injection and logging. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs dependency injection and wraps handler functions for asynchronous execution. It uses inspect.signature to match dependencies, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. Logging is benign. No network, system, or data exfiltration activities are present. The overall structure is typical for a message bus setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for dependency injection in a message handling system. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks in the provided fragment.",
