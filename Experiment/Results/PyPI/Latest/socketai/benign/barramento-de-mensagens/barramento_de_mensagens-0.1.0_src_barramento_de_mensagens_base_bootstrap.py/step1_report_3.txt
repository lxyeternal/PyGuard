{
  "purpose": "The code sets up dependency injection for message handlers and initializes a message bus system with handlers and configurations.",
  "sources": "Input sources are the handler functions (injected handlers) and the parameters extracted from these functions via inspect.signature.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write to files, network, or external systems. The only potential sink is the async handler invocation, which could invoke external logic if handlers perform such actions.",
  "flows": "Dependencies are injected into handlers based on matching parameter names. The injected handlers are then used within the BarramentoDeMensagens system, which may process messages asynchronously.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are visible. The code properly uses dependency injection and logging. The only noteworthy aspect is the use of an async wrapper that logs after handler execution, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages dependency injection and handler setup for a message bus system. It inspects handler functions to determine which dependencies to inject, then wraps these handlers in an async function that logs after execution. The code relies on external modules and expected messaging system behaviors but does not contain malicious patterns, suspicious network activity, or backdoors. The use of inspect.signature is standard for dependency injection, and the async wrapper appears to be a normal pattern. There are no obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of dependency injection and message handler setup for a message bus system. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It is well-structured with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
