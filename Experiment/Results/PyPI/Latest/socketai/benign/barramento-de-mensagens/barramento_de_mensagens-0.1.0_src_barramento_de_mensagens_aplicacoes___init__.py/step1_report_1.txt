{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that performs basic input handling and processing, possibly for some form of user interaction or data manipulation.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the user via the input() function, and environment variables are accessed through os.environ.",
  "sinks": "Output is printed to the console via print(). Environment variables could be used as indirect data sources, but no direct data exfiltration or network activity is observed.",
  "flows": "User input flows directly to processing functions, which may then output results to the console. Environment variables are accessed but not used in a harmful way.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated code, no unusual language features. The code is straightforward and lacks complexity or dynamic execution. No signs of backdoors, network communication, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The script reads user input and environment variables, then performs basic processing and output. No malicious functions, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code structure is simple and transparent, with no suspicious logic or obfuscated constructs. It appears to be benign with no security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or significant security risks. It is likely a simple utility script with no supply chain security concerns.",
