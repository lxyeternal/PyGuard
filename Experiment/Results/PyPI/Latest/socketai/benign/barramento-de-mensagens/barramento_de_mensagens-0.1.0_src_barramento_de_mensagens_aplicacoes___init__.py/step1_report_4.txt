  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly visible; potential sources could include environment variables, user input functions, or external files if present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but without the code, these cannot be confirmed.",
  "flows": "Without the actual code, it is impossible to identify specific source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without the code. Common signs include hardcoded credentials, obfuscated sections, or unusual system calls, none of which are visible here.",
  "analysis": "No code provided for review. Therefore, no analysis of sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies can be conducted. The review cannot be completed without examining the code content.",
