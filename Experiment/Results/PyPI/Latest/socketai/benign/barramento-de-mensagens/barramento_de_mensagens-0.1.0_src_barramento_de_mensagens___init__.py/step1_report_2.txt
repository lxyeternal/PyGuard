  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform standard data processing or utility functions, but due to lack of specific context, it is not entirely clear.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and function parameters; no external input sources are explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (if present), file writes, or system calls, but none are explicitly evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or function inputs through various processing steps, but without explicit network or system calls, no malicious flows are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are observed; code appears straightforward. Lack of comments and minimal context could suggest obfuscation or incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and lacks complex or suspicious constructs. No external data inputs, network activities, or system modifications are evident. The absence of visible malicious patterns suggests benign intent, though incomplete context limits certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but incomplete information prevents full assurance.",
