  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, function parameters, data files, configuration files, potential dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "From sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network or file operations, possibly involving dynamic execution or obfuscation techniques.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, suspicious flow patterns, misleading variable names, complex or convoluted code structures.",
  "analysis": "Reports with no code (1, 5) correctly assign zero scores; benign-looking code (2, 3) have low malware and risk scores consistent with their descriptions; suspicious, obfuscated code (4) shows high obfuscation (0.8) and moderate malware suspicion (0.4), justified by described techniques and suspicious flow patterns. The scores align with the evidence and reasoning, with Report 4 appropriately reflecting higher concern due to obfuscation and suspicious behavior. Overall, the scores are consistent and justified based on the provided descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that the scoring across reports is appropriate and aligns with the evidence. Report 4's higher obfuscation and suspicion scores are justified, indicating moderate to high concern, while other reports show minimal or no malicious indicators. No adjustments are necessary; further analysis of obfuscated code in Report 4 is recommended before deployment.",
