  "purpose": "Asynchronous event handler for processing Evento objects with monitoring and retries.",
  "sources": "evento parameter, external modules (barramento, sentry_sdk), asyncio, environment variables (indirectly via external modules).",
  "sinks": "barramento.handle(evento), sentry_sdk.start_transaction, asyncio.run() executing external async code.",
  "flows": "evento -> barramento.handle -> asyncio.run -> monitor (sentry_sdk) -> exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of asyncio.run() inside a Celery task is unconventional but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Celery task factory with retry policies, creates a task that modifies event state, initiates a Sentry transaction, and runs an async handler via asyncio.run(). No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The use of asyncio.run() within a Celery task is unusual but not malicious. External modules are used in standard ways. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured asynchronous event handler with monitoring and retries. It shows no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of asyncio.run() is unconventional but not harmful. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero.",
