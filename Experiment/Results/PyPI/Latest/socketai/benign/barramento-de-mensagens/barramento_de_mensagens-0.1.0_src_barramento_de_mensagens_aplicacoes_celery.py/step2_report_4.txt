  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and assess the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The analysis states that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The only unconventional aspect is the use of `asyncio.run()` within a Celery task, which is not typical but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score (0.2) seems appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is standard, with no suspicious network calls or data leaks. The use of `asyncio.run()` is noted but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No concerns about malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—standard async event handling with monitoring, no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score (0.1) is justified given the absence of issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, standard patterns, no malicious activity, with proper use of monitoring and retries.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no malicious behavior, standard async handling.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's standard nature, no vulnerabilities or malicious activities are detected. The only unconventional aspect is the use of `asyncio.run()` within a Celery task, which is acceptable but somewhat unusual. This alone doesn't justify a higher risk score.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (confirmed no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard async handling with monitoring)\n\nThe scores provided in the reports are reasonable and align with the analysis. There are no signs of malware or obfuscation, and the overall security risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard for async task processing with monitoring, and does not pose security concerns. The current scores are appropriate.",
