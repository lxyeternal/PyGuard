  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; standard use of libraries; use of asyncio.run() within a task; dynamic task creation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Celery task setup functions, including a task decorator factory. It configures retries and task parameters dynamically, then defines an asynchronous handler that manages Sentry tracing and executes an async function via asyncio.run(). The use of asyncio.run() inside a Celery task is unconventional but not inherently malicious. The code interacts with messaging and event handling, but no suspicious network activity or system modifications are evident. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. Sentry integration appears standard, used for monitoring. The structure and content suggest normal, intended behavior for async task processing with observability.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement standard asynchronous task handling with monitoring. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The use of asyncio.run() within a task is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, the code seems safe and aligns with typical async task management practices.",
