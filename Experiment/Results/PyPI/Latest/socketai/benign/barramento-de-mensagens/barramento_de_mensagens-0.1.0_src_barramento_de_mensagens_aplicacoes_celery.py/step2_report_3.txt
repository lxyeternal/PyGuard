  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code sets up Celery tasks, uses retries, and executes an async handler with `asyncio.run()`. No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. Sentry integration is standard.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, with a low security risk (0.2). This aligns with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on data flow from parameters into message handling and Sentry. No malicious code or backdoors. Use of `asyncio.run()` is noted but not suspicious.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, security risk 0.2, consistent.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies standard async handling, no malicious signs.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Focuses on the flow from input parameters through event handling and monitoring. No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, risk 0.1, matching the benign assessment.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, with no signs of malicious behavior. The use of `asyncio.run()` and external modules appears standard.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, risk 0.2, consistent.\n- **Assessment:** No issues identified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Emphasizes standard patterns, no secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The use of asyncio.run() is noted but not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, risk 0.2, consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly concludes the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code appears correct, with no signs of vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- **Scores & Justification:**\n  - **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious intent or activity detected.\n  - **Obfuscated Score:** 0; code is clear and standard.\n  - **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting typical operational risks but no significant security concerns.\n\n- **Special Considerations:**\n  - The use of `asyncio.run()` within a Celery task is unconventional but not malicious. It warrants caution in production but is not inherently dangerous.\n  - No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident.\n  - External modules like `barramento_de_mensagens` and `sentry_sdk` are used in standard ways.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (minimal operational risk, typical for async task handling with retries and monitoring)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation of asynchronous event handling with monitoring. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Work through this step-by-step, and I am confident in these assessments.**",
