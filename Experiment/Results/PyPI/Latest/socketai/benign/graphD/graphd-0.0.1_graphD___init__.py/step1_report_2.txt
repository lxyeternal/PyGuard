{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an example and interface for creating and visualizing graphs using the graphD library.",
  "sources": "Input data includes user-defined graph nodes and edges, and the filename parameter in the plot function.",
  "sinks": "The plot function writes to a filename, potentially writing files to disk; the print statement outputs the filename.",
  "flows": "User input (nodes, edges, filename) flows into graph creation and plotting functions, resulting in file creation and output display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; usage appears to be straightforward and typical for a graph plotting library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core components, defines an example usage of creating a graph with nodes and edges, then renders the graph to a file named 'my_graph.ppm'. It includes standard plotting and printing statements. There are no indications of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors. The comments and code structure are consistent with typical visualization examples. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The only file operation is writing an image file, which is expected behavior for a graph rendering library.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign example demonstrating how to use the graphD library for graph visualization. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. The code appears safe and straightforward.",
