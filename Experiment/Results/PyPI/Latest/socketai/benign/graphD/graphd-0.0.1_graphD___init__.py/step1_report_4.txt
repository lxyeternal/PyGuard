{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python library for creating and visualizing graphs, providing functions to add nodes, edges, and render images.",
  "sources": "Code imports from local modules (.core and .renderer), and reads user input when creating graphs and specifying filenames.",
  "sinks": "Uses the filename parameter in plot() to write an image file; potentially writes to user-specified file paths.",
  "flows": "User creates a graph, calls plot() with a filename, which then writes an image file to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious file operations are observed. The example code is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be part of a graph visualization library. It imports modules, defines public API, and contains an example usage in docstring format. The example demonstrates creating nodes and edges, then rendering to a file. The use of the filename parameter in plot() is typical for output. No code injections, network calls, or suspicious logic are present. The example is illustrative and does not contain hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard graph visualization library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply processes input data to generate images based on user-defined graphs.",
