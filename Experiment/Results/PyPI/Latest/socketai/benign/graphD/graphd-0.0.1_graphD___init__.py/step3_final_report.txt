{
  "purpose": "A simple example demonstrating the creation and rendering of a graph using the graphD library, including node and edge additions and saving the output image.",
  "sources": "Input data such as node labels, colors, sizes, edge weights, and the filename parameter for saving the image.",
  "sinks": "The plot function writes the generated graph image to a file specified by the filename parameter.",
  "flows": "Data flows from node and edge addition methods to the rendering function, which then outputs the image file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and typical for such visualization tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core and renderer modules, defines an example graph with nodes and edges, and saves the visualization to a file. It does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or network activity. The filename parameter is static in the example, posing minimal risk. The overall structure is clear, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, illustrative example of using the graphD library for graph visualization. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate given the minimal potential for misuse in this context.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
