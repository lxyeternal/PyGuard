{
  "purpose": "The provided code is a library for creating and rendering graph visualizations, with example usage demonstrating graph construction and rendering to an image file.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from user-provided node and edge attributes during graph creation, and the example reads a filename string for saving output.",
  "sinks": "The code writes the output filename to the console and potentially writes an image file to disk via the plot function; no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or system commands.",
  "flows": "User input (node attributes, filename) flows into graph construction and rendering functions; output filename flows into the plotting function and then printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code structure is straightforward, and the example usage is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, explicit __all__ declaration, and a multi-line string comment providing usage instructions and description. It does not contain any executable logic beyond imports and documentation. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The included example code is typical for a graph library and does not demonstrate any harmful actions. There is no use of dynamic execution, external data fetching, or credential handling. The code appears to be a standard, benign module setup with documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign Python library module for graph visualization with example usage. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are evident. It appears safe for use.",
