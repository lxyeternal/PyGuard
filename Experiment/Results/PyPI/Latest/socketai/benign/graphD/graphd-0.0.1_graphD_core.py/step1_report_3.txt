  "purpose": "Defines a Graph class for creating, updating, and rendering graph structures with nodes and edges.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in methods: node_id, node1_id, node2_id, **kwargs, filename, width, height; data from the GraphRenderer.render method.",
  "sinks": "File output via renderer.render (writes image file), potential for file overwrite or writing to unexpected locations if filename is manipulated.",
  "flows": "Data flows from graph creation and modification into the plot function, which passes the graph and filename to the renderer, resulting in file output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for warnings; no unusual or obfuscated code detected. The import statement uses a relative import which is typical but could be scrutinized in a different context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard graph data structure with methods to add nodes and edges, with input validation for node existence. The plot function uses an external renderer module to generate an image file. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. File writing is limited to a specified filename, with no hardcoded secrets or unsafe operations. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a graph drawing utility, with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical graph rendering utility with no apparent malicious intent. It manages graph data and outputs an image file using a renderer module, which is a common pattern. No malware or security risks are evident from this review.",
