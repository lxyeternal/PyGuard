{
  "purpose": "A pixel-based rendering system for visualizing graphs, implementing drawing functions from scratch without external dependencies.",
  "sources": "Graph data accessed via get_nodes() and get_edges(); filename provided for output.",
  "sinks": "Writes image data to a PPM file; no network or external command execution.",
  "flows": "Graph data flows into rendering functions, culminating in image file creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or secret data; unused 'os' import is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard visualization tasks: layout calculation, drawing lines, circles, and text, and saving images. No malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscated constructs are present. The filename input could pose a minor security concern if untrusted, but it does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, consistent with the benign behavior. Obfuscation is absent, so score is 0. The low risk score (~0.1) reflects typical file output operations with minimal security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe graph visualization utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned malware and obfuscation scores are correct; the low risk score is appropriate given the minimal security considerations.",
