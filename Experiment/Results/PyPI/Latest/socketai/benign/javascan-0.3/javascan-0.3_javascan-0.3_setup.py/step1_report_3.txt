  "purpose": "Define and set up the 'javascan' Python package with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "os.makedirs('/tmp/javascan-deps') - creates a directory; setup() parameters - package info; install_requires - dependencies.",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data; setup metadata and dependencies are static and controlled.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no malicious data handling or transfer observed.",
  "anomalies": "Creation of '/tmp/javascan-deps' directory at module load time may be unusual but does not constitute malicious activity. No use of environment variables, network, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports distutils to define package setup, creates a temporary directory, and specifies package metadata and dependencies. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. The directory creation at import time is odd but benign. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward package setup script with an unusual directory creation step. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It does not contain malware or security flaws based on the provided code.",
