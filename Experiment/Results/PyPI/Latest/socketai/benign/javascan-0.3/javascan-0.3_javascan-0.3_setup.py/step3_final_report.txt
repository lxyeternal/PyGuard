  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'javascan' Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the environment during import (creating a directory), and from the setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The directory creation occurs at import time, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual immediate creation of '/tmp/javascan-deps' directory at import time; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with a side effect of creating a directory upon import, which is unconventional but not malicious. No obfuscation, secrets, or network activity are present. The directory creation could be benign or residual code. No malicious payloads or suspicious patterns are identified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with this benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with an unusual but harmless directory creation. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
