  "purpose": "A Java code linter designed to check class declarations, method naming, and variable naming conventions using regular expressions.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'code' which contains Java source code as a string.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to files, network, or external systems; it only processes the input string.",
  "flows": "Reads input string line-by-line; applies regex checks to detect naming convention violations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code is straightforward and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code implements pattern matching to verify Java code style conventions. It only reads input data and performs regex checks without executing or modifying external systems. No obfuscated or suspicious code behaviors are present. There are no signs of malicious activity or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Java linter focused on style enforcement. It performs regex-based static analysis without any malicious intent or malicious behaviors. No security risks or malware indicators are identified.",
