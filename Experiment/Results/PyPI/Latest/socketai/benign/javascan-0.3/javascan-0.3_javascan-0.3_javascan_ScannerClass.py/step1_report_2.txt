{
  "purpose": "This code provides a simple Java code linter to check class, method, and variable naming conventions.",
  "sources": "Code reads input Java code as a string and processes it line-by-line to identify specific code patterns.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "The code reads input code, processes each line to match naming patterns, and reports errors accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code performs straightforward regex-based checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods to check Java class declarations, method naming, and variable naming conventions using regex. It scans input code line-by-line for specific patterns and logs errors for deviations. There are no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The code is a basic static analyzer focused solely on style conformance, with no network activity, code injection, or obfuscated logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Java code style linter with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as intended for static analysis of Java code styling conventions.",
