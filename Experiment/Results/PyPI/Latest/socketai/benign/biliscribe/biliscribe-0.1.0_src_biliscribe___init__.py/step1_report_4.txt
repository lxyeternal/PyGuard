  "purpose": "This module serves as an entry point that initializes and runs an asynchronous server process.",
  "sources": "Import statements (asyncio, server module), execution of server.main() function",
  "sinks": "server.main() invocation (potentially executing untrusted code within server module)",
  "flows": "Import asyncio -> import server -> main() calls server.main() -> asyncio.run() executes server.main()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, straightforward import and execution pattern, no suspicious modules or code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard asyncio and a local server module, defines a version string, and runs server.main() within an asyncio event loop. The server module's code is not provided, so potential malicious activity depends on its implementation. The current script itself is simple and appears standard for an async server entry point. There are no anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The only potential concern is reliance on server.main(), which could contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, straightforward entry point for running an asynchronous server. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. The overall security risk is low, but full assessment depends on the implementation of the server module.",
