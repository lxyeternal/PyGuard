{
  "purpose": "This code initializes an asynchronous server application by importing the server module and running its main function.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module's version string and imports the server module.",
  "sinks": "The code invokes server.main() which may contain untrusted data processing, but cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "flows": "The main() function calls asyncio.run(server.main()), potentially executing code within server.main().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string, imports asyncio and a local server module, and defines a main() function that runs server.main() asynchronously. It exports version, main, and server. No external data sources or sinks are evident in this fragment. Since server.main() is called, its content could introduce risks, but it is not visible here. The code appears to be standard application bootstrap code without malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, legitimate startup script for an asynchronous server, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
