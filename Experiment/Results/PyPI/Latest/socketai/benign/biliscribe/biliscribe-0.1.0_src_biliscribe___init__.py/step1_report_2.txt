{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for an asynchronous server application, initializing and running the server's main function.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading mechanisms are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects, such as network transmission or file writing, within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling asyncio.run on server.main(), which starts the server's main asynchronous process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports asyncio and a local module 'server'. It defines a version string and a main() function that runs server.main() asynchronously. The __all__ list exports version, main, and server for module clarity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code injections. The code appears to be a standard module entry point for an asynchronous server application, with no suspicious or anomalous features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign entry point script that initializes an asynchronous server. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet.",
