{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a simple entry point for a Python package or module that runs an asynchronous server.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports the 'asyncio' module and a local 'server' module, then calls server.main() within asyncio.run().",
  "sinks": "The code invokes server.main(), which could potentially execute untrusted code if the server module is malicious, but the current code itself does not perform any data leaks or insecure operations.",
  "flows": "The main() function calls server.main() within an asyncio event loop, but no data flows are explicitly shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code structure is typical for an async application entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code imports asyncio and a local server module, defines a version string, and a main() function that runs server.main() asynchronously. It exports __version__, main, and server. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or insecure operations. The simplicity and standard pattern suggest this is a benign startup script. However, the security of the overall application depends on the implementation of server.main(), which is not shown here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard bootstrap script for an asynchronous server application. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are evident within this snippet. Its security posture hinges on the implementation of server.main().",
