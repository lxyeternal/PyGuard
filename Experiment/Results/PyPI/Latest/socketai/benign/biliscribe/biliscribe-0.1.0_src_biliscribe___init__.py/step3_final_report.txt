  "purpose": "Minimal asyncio server bootstrap code that imports asyncio and a local server module, then runs server.main() within an event loop.",
  "sources": "Importing asyncio and the local server module; calling server.main() in main().",
  "sinks": "Execution of server.main(), which could contain untrusted code, but not evident here.",
  "flows": "main() calls asyncio.run(server.main()), with no other data flows or input sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for an async server entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing asyncio and a local server module, defining a version string, and executing server.main() asynchronously. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The security implications depend on server.main() implementation, which is not provided. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are evident in this snippet. The code appears benign and standard for a server bootstrap. Malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero; risk score is very low (~0.1) due to the simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard asyncio server entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security posture depends on server.main(), but based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
