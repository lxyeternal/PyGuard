  "conclusion": "The code is vulnerable to command injection due to unsanitized 'video_url' being embedded directly into shell commands. While no malware or obfuscation is present, the potential for exploitation is high. Addressing input validation and safer subprocess invocation is critical to mitigate this security risk."
