{
  "purpose": "Define a class for transforming and harmonizing vectors, likely for machine learning applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input vectors v1 and v2 within the _vector_harmony method.",
  "sinks": "The code performs vector calculations, but does not write data to external systems or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input vectors v1 and v2 are processed through the _vector_harmony function, with no external data outputs or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for mathematical vector operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and typing modules, then defines a class inheriting from a potentially external TransformativeHarmonization class. The class implements a vector harmony method, which computes a weighted similarity between two vectors, involving normalization, cosine similarity, and vector averaging. No input/output outside the process, no network or system modification, or hidden malicious behavior detected. The operations are mathematical and standard for vector similarity calculations, with proper exception handling for shape mismatch.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate vector transformation class for machine learning purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The operations are standard mathematical vector manipulations, and no external malicious behaviors are present.",
