{
  "purpose": "Define a class for vector transformation and harmonization, optimized for machine learning, with a customizable harmony function.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy, typing for type annotations, and a local module .core for TransformativeHarmonization.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input data or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input vectors v1 and v2 are processed through the _vector_harmony function, which performs mathematical computations using numpy, and the result is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs numerical operations with potential division by very small numbers, but includes safeguards (adding epsilon). No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The class extends a base class, initializing with a default harmony function if none is provided. The _vector_harmony method calculates a similarity measure between two vectors, involving normalization, cosine similarity, and a weighted combination. It performs standard vector operations with no indications of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious external communications are present. The mathematical operations are typical for vector similarity calculations and do not appear malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements vector harmonization using standard numpy operations without any suspicious or malicious activity. It is a normal component for a machine learning pipeline, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
