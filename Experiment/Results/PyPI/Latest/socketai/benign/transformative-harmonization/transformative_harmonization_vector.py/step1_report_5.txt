{
  "purpose": "Define a class for vector transformation and harmonization using customizable functions, primarily for machine learning applications.",
  "sources": "Input vectors v1 and v2, context parameters from the class initialization or function call.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data if vectors contain private or confidential information; mathematical computations are local and do not leak data by themselves.",
  "flows": "Input vectors -> _vector_harmony function -> calculation of norms and similarities -> return transformed vector.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. The code performs standard mathematical vector operations. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and typing modules, then defines a class that inherits from a presumably external core class. It implements a vector harmony function that calculates a weighted cosine similarity, normalized vector sum, and returns a scaled, harmonized vector. No external network calls, file operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. All operations are standard mathematical computations suitable for vector transformations in machine learning contexts. The code appears straightforward and purpose-driven, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a vector harmonization class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs mathematical calculations safely and locally, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
