  "purpose": "Performs vector similarity and harmonization calculations for machine learning applications.",
  "sources": "Reads input vectors v1 and v2 for similarity computation.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; operates solely in-memory.",
  "flows": "Input vectors are processed through normalization, cosine similarity, and weighted combination within the _vector_harmony method.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; safeguards against division by zero are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward vector similarity function with shape validation and numerical stability measures. No external communication, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The operations are standard numpy vector calculations, and the code structure is clear and well-documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, mathematically standard vector transformation utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk 0 are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
