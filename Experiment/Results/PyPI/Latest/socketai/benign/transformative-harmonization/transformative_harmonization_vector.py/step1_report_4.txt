{
  "purpose": "Define a class for vector transformation and harmonization, optimized for machine learning.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'harmony_function', 'context', and internal vector inputs v1 and v2.",
  "sinks": "The code performs mathematical operations on inputs; no external data sinks, network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in '_vector_harmony' to produce a transformed vector, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code performs straightforward mathematical vector operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass for vector harmonization, utilizing numpy for calculations. It accepts custom harmony functions and context parameters. The core method computes a vector similarity based on norms and angles, with proper input validation. There are no signs of malicious logic, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The operations are standard mathematical transformations for vector similarity computation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign mathematical utility for vector transformations, with no malicious intent or security risks observed.",
