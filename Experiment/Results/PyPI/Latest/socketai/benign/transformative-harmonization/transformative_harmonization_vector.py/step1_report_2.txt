{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for vector transformation and harmonization using customizable functions, optimized for machine learning contexts.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy as np, and a local module .core (TransformativeHarmonization).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no network, file, or environment variable operations observed.",
  "flows": "The class method _vector_harmony processes two input vectors to produce a transformed vector, with calculations based on vector norms and dot products.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of TransformativeHarmonization with an initialization that sets a default harmony function. The main method _vector_harmony computes a combined vector using cosine similarity, normalization, and weighted adjustments, with proper input validation for vector shapes. No data leaks, network activity, or obfuscated code present. Uses standard numpy functions and safe mathematical operations. No indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of vector harmonization for machine learning, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
