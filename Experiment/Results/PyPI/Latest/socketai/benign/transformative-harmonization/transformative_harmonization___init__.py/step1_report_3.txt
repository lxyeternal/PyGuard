{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define the exports for a Python package related to data harmonization modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .core, .vector, .matrix, .custom",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform critical actions",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only imports modules and defines package metadata",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from local modules, sets a version string, and defines the __all__ list for module exports. There are no functions, user inputs, network operations, or data handling that could be exploited. The code structure is simple and standard for Python packages. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to serve as a module initializer or package interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
