  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a straightforward `__init__.py` file that imports classes from sibling modules, defines a version string, and sets the `__all__` list for exports.\n   - There are no functions, user inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security and Malicious Indicators**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is standard, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n   - No data sinks or flows involving untrusted data are present.\n   - The code structure is typical for Python packages and does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Scores**:\n   - The reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, which is consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n   - The overall security risk score is 0, which seems appropriate given the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - All reports are consistent and do not raise any red flags.\n   - The only concern might be if the imported modules (`.core`, `.vector`, `.matrix`, `.custom`) contain malicious code, but based solely on this file, there's no evidence of that.\n\n5. **Final Recommendations**:\n   - Since the code is purely an import and export setup with no suspicious activity, the current scores are reasonable.\n   - No changes are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code appears to be a standard, benign package initialization file with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
