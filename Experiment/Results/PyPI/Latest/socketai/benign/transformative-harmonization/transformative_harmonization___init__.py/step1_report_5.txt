  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module's __init__.py file, used to organize and expose specific classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .core, .vector, .matrix, .custom; and the __version__ string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output occurring.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only imports modules and sets version and export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from local submodules, sets a version string, and defines __all__ for exports. It is a typical package __init__.py pattern. No code execution, user input, or external data handling present. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
