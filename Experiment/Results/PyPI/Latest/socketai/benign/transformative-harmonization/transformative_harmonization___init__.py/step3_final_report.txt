{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing specific classes from sibling modules and defining the module's version and export list.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.core, .vector, .matrix, .custom)",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only imports and exports classes without data flow or dynamic execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern with no obfuscated or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python __init__.py file that imports classes from sibling modules, sets a version string, and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code, network calls, or data handling. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns confirm it is safe and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's structure and content.",
