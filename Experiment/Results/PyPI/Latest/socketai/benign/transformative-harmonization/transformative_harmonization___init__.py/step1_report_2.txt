{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module's __init__.py file that imports and exposes certain classes for package usage.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.core, .vector, .matrix, .custom), and versioning and export variables.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code only imports modules and defines variables.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only manages internal imports and variable definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code structure is typical for a package's initialization file.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing specific classes from local modules and defining package metadata and export list. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or credential management. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization file with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
