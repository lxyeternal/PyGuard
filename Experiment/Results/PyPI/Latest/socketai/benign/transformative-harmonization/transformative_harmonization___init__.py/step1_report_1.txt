{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module's __init__.py file, used to import specific classes from local modules and define the package's version and export interface.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .core, .vector, .matrix, .custom",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communications",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code, no obfuscated code or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports classes from sibling modules, sets a version string, and defines an export list. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py, and it does not include any executable code beyond imports and definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization file with no malicious intent or security concerns. It only manages package imports and exports, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
