{
  "purpose": "Module export definitions for harmonization classes in a Python package",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.core, .vector, .matrix, .custom), version string assignment, and __all__ list definition",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code only sets up module exports and version information",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not process user input or external data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from local modules, assigns a version string, and defines __all__ for module exports. All actions are typical for Python package setup files, serving to organize and expose components for external use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code appears straightforward and standard in structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely manages module exports and version info.",
