{
  "purpose": "A class implementing a mathematical harmonization process with customizable functions and context, primarily for numeric or array data.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to methods (__init__, harmonize, continuity), attributes self.harmony_function and self.context.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted external input or data; the code primarily performs mathematical operations and method calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input args to harmony_function within harmonize; context parameters influence calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard math and numpy libraries without obfuscation or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for mathematical data transformation with customizable functions and context parameters. It performs calculations involving energy averages and similarity metrics. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The only potential concern might be if custom harmony functions are malicious, but that is user-provided. The default implementation is benign. No suspicious or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a mathematical transformation utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard operations and provides hooks for customization. No signs of malware or security issues.",
