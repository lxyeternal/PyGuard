{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for performing mathematical transformations and harmonic alignment on numeric data, with customizable behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via function arguments in methods such as harmonize() and continuity(). It also accesses context parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or sensitive data leaks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method arguments into the harmonic computation functions. No untrusted external data sources or outputs are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. It uses standard math functions and straightforward control flow. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a class for contextual harmonic transformations with customizable functions. It involves standard mathematical operations with no evidence of malicious intent. All functions perform legitimate mathematical calculations. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The class appears to be a mathematical utility for data processing. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mathematical utility class intended for data transformation and harmonic analysis. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
