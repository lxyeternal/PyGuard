{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python class for performing a contextual harmonic transformation on numerical inputs, enabling customizable and default harmonic functions for numerical data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input numbers through the harmonize method, which takes variable positional arguments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially harmful operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data (numbers) are passed into the harmonize method, which then applies a user-defined or default harmonic function repeatedly to produce a combined result.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code constructs; it uses standard mathematical functions and simple class methods. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network interactions are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward implementation of a harmonic transformation class, with an optional user-defined harmonic function. It performs standard mathematical operations, handles input validation, and provides properties about the harmonic function's characteristics. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors, are present. It appears to be a benign utility class for numerical computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign mathematical utility class for performing harmonic transformations with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious behavior or malware indicators.",
