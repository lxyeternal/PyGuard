  "purpose": "A Python class implementing a customizable mathematical transformation, specifically for harmonic and energy-based data alignment, with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input numeric values provided to the harmonize method; internal use of math functions; no external data or network sources.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; no network communication, file I/O, or external command execution.",
  "flows": "Input values flow into the harmonize method, are processed through the harmony_function (default or user-defined), resulting in a transformed output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward implementation of mathematical operations with standard libraries; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for performing mathematical transformations with customizable functions and context parameters. It includes input validation, error handling for division by zero, and properties indicating function characteristics. The default harmony function combines energy averaging and cosine similarity, both standard mathematical operations. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The code is well-structured, clear, and free of obfuscation. The only potential external risk is if a user supplies a malicious custom harmony function, but this is outside the static analysis scope. The malware score is therefore 0, the obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented mathematical utility class with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score accounts for the potential misuse of user-defined functions, but the core code itself is safe. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with this analysis.",
