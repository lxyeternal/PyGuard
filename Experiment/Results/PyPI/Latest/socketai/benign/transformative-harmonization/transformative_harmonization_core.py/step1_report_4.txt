{
  "purpose": "The code implements a class for performing a customizable transformation or harmonization process on numerical data, primarily for mathematical or data processing purposes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user inputs; all data processed are passed as function arguments within the class methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that send data externally, perform network operations, or interact with sensitive system components.",
  "flows": "The flow involves passing numerical arguments to the 'harmonize' method, which then applies a user-defined or default harmony function to combine these inputs. No external or untrusted data flows into or out of the system in a way that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears well-structured with clear documentation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present. Usage of mathematical functions is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that allows for custom mathematical transformations with default and user-specified functions. It performs basic mathematical operations, with safeguards against division by zero. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or covert operations. The class methods handle inputs securely and do not interact with external systems. The functions are straightforward and use standard Python libraries. The absence of network calls, file I/O, or system commands suggests no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a customizable data harmonization class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs mathematical computations within a controlled scope, with no external communication or security-sensitive operations.",
