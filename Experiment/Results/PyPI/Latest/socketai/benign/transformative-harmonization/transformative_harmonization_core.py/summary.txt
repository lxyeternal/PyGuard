  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented mathematical utility class with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score accounts for the potential misuse of user-defined functions, but the core code itself is safe. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with this analysis."
