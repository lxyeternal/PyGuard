{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom class for user-defined transformation functions, inheriting from a core module.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'harmony_function' and 'context' provided during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points; the code only performs validation and superclass initialization.",
  "flows": "Input 'harmony_function' is validated for callability and then passed to the superclass; no external data flow to untrusted sources identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; standard validation and inheritance structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that extends a core class, with a constructor validating that a provided function is callable. It raises an exception if validation fails and proceeds to initialize the superclass with the provided parameters. No data leakage, external network calls, or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears to be a standard, safe class definition for customization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward class definition with input validation and inheritance; there are no malicious behaviors or security concerns detected.",
