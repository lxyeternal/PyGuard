{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom class for user-defined data harmonization functions by extending an existing class.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'harmony_function' and optional 'context' during initialization.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is output or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input 'harmony_function' is validated and passed to the superclass; no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from 'TransformativeHarmonization'. It performs a simple validation to ensure 'harmony_function' is callable, then calls the superclass constructor. The code includes docstrings in Turkish but contains no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious intent. It uses standard Python practices without unsafe operations or external data transmissions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward extension for custom data processing with no malicious behavior or security issues. It mainly validates input and delegates functionality to a superclass.",
