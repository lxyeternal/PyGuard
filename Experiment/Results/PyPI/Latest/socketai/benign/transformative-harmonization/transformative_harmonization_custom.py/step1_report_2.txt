  "purpose": "Define a custom class for specialized harmonization functions, extending core functionality.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'harmony_function' and 'context' in the __init__ method.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is sent to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input 'harmony_function' flows from the constructor argument to the callable check, then to the superclass initializer.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code properly checks if 'harmony_function' is callable before use.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from a core module, initializing with a user-defined function. It validates the function type and calls the parent constructor. No external data sources, network operations, or data leaks are present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The structure is straightforward, with standard Python practices. No malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard class definition with proper validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
