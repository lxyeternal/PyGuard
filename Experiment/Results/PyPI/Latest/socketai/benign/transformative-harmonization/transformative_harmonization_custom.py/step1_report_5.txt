  "purpose": "Defines a custom harmonization class inheriting from TransformativeHarmonization, allowing users to pass in their own harmony functions with optional context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'harmony_function' and 'context' in the __init__ method.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used directly in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'harmony_function' is validated for callability, then passed to the parent class constructor.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs type validation for 'harmony_function' and initializes the parent class. It includes docstrings in Turkish, indicating purpose and parameter details. There are no network operations, data leaks, or code injection points. The validation step is straightforward and safe. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe class definition with input validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
