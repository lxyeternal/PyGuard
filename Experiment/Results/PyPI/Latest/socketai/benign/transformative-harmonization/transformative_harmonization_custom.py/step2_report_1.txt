  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code is a straightforward class definition extending a core module.\n- The primary functionality is validating that a user-provided function is callable and passing it to the superclass.\n- No external data flows, network calls, or data leaks are detected.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are present.\n- The code includes Turkish docstrings but no signs of hidden or malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are all zero, aligning with the analysis that there's no malicious behavior.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The logic is simple and standard: input validation and inheritance.\n- The validation of 'harmony_function' as callable is appropriate and does not introduce security risks.\n- No external or untrusted data sources are involved.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are observed.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or used maliciously.\n\n**Scores and Reasoning:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the lack of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are low (0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal security concerns.\n- The confidence levels are high, indicating the reviewers are certain about their assessments.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, standard class extension with proper validation.\n- No evidence supports any malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to the minimal validation logic, but not a concern)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as safe and straightforward. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the analysis. There is no indication of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities in this code snippet.",
