{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for custom data transformation functions, validating that the provided function is callable before passing it to the superclass.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'harmony_function' provided during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Validation of 'harmony_function' as callable, then passing it to superclass constructor.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class extension that validates the 'harmony_function' parameter to ensure it is callable. It then delegates to the superclass constructor. There are no network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The validation is minimal and appropriate, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious intent. The code's simplicity and the absence of external data handling indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe class extension with proper validation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
