{
  "purpose": "Defines a subclass for customized harmonization functions, allowing users to pass in their own callable functions with optional context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'harmony_function' and 'context' in the __init__ method, which are used during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not perform any output, network operations, or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "The 'harmony_function' is validated for callability, then passed to the superclass constructor; no external data flow outside initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward class extension with validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a class inheriting from 'TransformativeHarmonization', and performs input validation on 'harmony_function'. It raises an error if the function is not callable. The code appears to be a standard class setup without suspicious behavior or obfuscation. There are no network, file, or sensitive data operations. The structure and logic are typical for a customizable class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class definition for customizable harmonization functions with proper validation. No malicious or security-related issues are present.",
