{
  "purpose": "A simple demonstration package for publishing on PyPI, providing a static greeting message.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, environment variables, or data sources; static code with no data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmission points; code only returns a static string.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; function returns a fixed string without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and a single function 'hello()' that returns a static greeting in Chinese. It contains no external inputs, no data processing, no network or file operations, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and purpose as a demonstration package support these conclusions. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The package is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The code is straightforward, matches its purpose, and is free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
