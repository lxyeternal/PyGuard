  "flows": "Reading static file content into long_description; no data flow beyond file reading.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without exception handling, but this is typical in setup scripts; no malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script that imports setuptools, defines package metadata, reads a local README.md file for long_description, and calls setup() with standard parameters. It contains no dynamic code, user input, external data processing, or obfuscated patterns. All signals point to benign, standard behavior. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The use of open() without exception handling is common in such scripts and does not indicate malicious intent. The static analysis and consistent reports support a conclusion of no malicious or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. No modifications are necessary.",
