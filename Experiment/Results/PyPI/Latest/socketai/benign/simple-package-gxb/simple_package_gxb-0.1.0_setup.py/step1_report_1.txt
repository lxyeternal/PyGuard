{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, used with setuptools to define package metadata and build instructions.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; no data leaks or external system effects",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the script only reads static metadata and a README file",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package metadata including name, version, author, description, and URL. It reads the README.md file for long_description content without any processing or dynamic execution. The setup parameters are standard for a Python package, with no dynamic code, user input handling, or external data manipulation. All components are static and typical for package configuration. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
