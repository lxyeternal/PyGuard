  "purpose": "To define package metadata and configuration for distribution using setuptools",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data output or external data handling",
  "flows": "N/A; straightforward setup configuration without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors; no obfuscation or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It imports setuptools, specifies package info, reads a README file for the long description, and defines metadata such as name, version, author, and classifiers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The code performs typical package setup tasks without any suspicious logic or external data handling beyond reading a local file.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard package setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
