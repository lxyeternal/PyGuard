{
  "purpose": "Custom assertion comparison for pytest that formats views specially",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'left' and 'right' which are used in repr conversion",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe operations",
  "flows": "Input 'left' and 'right' flow into conditional checks and repr formatting, with no external or network interactions",
  "anomalies": "Use of a potentially external View class from 'markupy' library; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; simple formatting logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pytest hook function that compares two objects, formatting them differently if they are instances of 'View'. It only manipulates strings and performs no I/O, network, or data leakage operations. The 'markupy' library import is not inherently suspicious, and no other risky behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a harmless custom pytest comparison hook with no malicious intent or security risks.",
