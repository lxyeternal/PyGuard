  "purpose": "A pytest hook function to customize assertion failure message representations, formatting 'View' instances distinctly.",
  "sources": "The 'View' class from 'markupy' used in isinstance checks for 'left' and 'right' arguments.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only performs string formatting and returns a list of strings, with no external data handling or side effects.",
  "flows": "Input arguments 'left' and 'right' are checked for type; if 'View', formatted with backticks, else repr() is used; results are returned as a list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type checking and string formatting. No obfuscation, external data, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'View' from 'markupy' and defines a pytest hook to improve assertion message readability. It conditionally formats 'View' instances with backticks, otherwise uses repr(). It performs no network activity, data leaks, or code execution. The logic is simple, correct, and benign. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are present. The import from 'markupy' is legitimate, and the function only manipulates strings for display purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for pytest assertion message formatting. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior is present. The security and malware scores are correctly set to 0, with high confidence, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
