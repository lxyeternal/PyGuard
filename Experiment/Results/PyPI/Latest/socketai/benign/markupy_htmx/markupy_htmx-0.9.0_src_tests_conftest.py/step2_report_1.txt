  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward pytest utility function.\n- The code imports `View` from `markupy` and uses it solely for conditional formatting.\n- There are no indications of external data handling, network activity, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- The function only manipulates strings for assertion output, with no side effects or external interactions.\n\n**2. Logical Flaws or Errors:**\n- The code logic appears correct for its purpose: checking if objects are instances of `View` and formatting accordingly.\n- No flaws or anomalies are identified in the implementation.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Scores:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- Confidence levels are high (1.0 or 0.9), which seems appropriate given the clear, straightforward code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the simplicity of the code.\n\n**4. Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n- No reason exists to assign a risk score above 0.5; the code is a harmless testing utility.\n- Malware score is correctly set to 0, reflecting no malicious activity.\n\n**5. Potential Assumptions or Claims:**\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent.\n- The import from `markupy` is standard and not suspicious.\n\n**6. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard pytest hook function used for customizing assertion message formatting. It performs no malicious actions, no data leaks, and no external communication. The use of `View` from `markupy` is legitimate and only influences string representation. All indicators point to a safe, utility-level function with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis supply chain incident report overstates the risk; the code is entirely safe and straightforward. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
