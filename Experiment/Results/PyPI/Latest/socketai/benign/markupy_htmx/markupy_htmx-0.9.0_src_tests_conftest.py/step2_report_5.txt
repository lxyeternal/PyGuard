  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple pytest hook function for customizing assertion failure messages.\n- The import of `View` from `markupy` is consistent across reports and appears legitimate.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or data leaks are identified.\n- The code only manipulates string representations based on object types.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose is purely for improved test output readability.\n\n**Malware and security risk scores:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk score is also 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence scores are high (1 or 0.9), indicating strong agreement that this code is safe.\n\n**Potential issues or points of contention:**\n- The only minor point is the use of `View` from `markupy`. If `markupy` is an external or less-known package, there could be a remote chance of malicious or compromised versions. However, the reports do not suggest any suspicious activity or anomalies related to this package.\n- The code's logic is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- The high confidence scores support the conclusion that this code is safe.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n- The code is a benign utility function for pytest, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis supply chain dependency appears safe. The code is straightforward, well-understood, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores reflect this accurately.",
