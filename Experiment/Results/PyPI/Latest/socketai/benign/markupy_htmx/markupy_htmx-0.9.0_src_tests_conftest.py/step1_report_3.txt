{
  "purpose": "Provides a custom pytest assertion comparison representation for objects, specifically formatting 'View' instances distinctly.",
  "sources": "The 'left' and 'right' parameters, which are inputs to the function; the 'View' class from 'markupy' module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or external communication; the code only formats and returns strings.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'left' and 'right' flow through conditional formatting to produce a list of strings; no untrusted data reaches external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic; the code performs straightforward string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The function takes comparison operands 'left' and 'right' along with an operator 'op'. It checks if these operands are instances of 'View' and formats them accordingly, wrapping 'View' instances in backticks for clarity. The function then returns a list of strings representing the comparison. There is no code that reads from untrusted sources, executes dynamic code, or communicates externally. The use of 'markupy.View' appears to be purely for formatting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility function intended for test assertion reporting. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
