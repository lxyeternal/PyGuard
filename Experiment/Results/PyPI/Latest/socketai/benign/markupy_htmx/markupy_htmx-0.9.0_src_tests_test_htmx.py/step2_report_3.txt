  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the described logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely test functions verifying static HTML string outputs generated by library functions. No external data, no user input, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns are detected.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is safe, with no malware or security risks. The confidence level is 1.0, which seems appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0. These are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on controlled data flow, no external or untrusted data, and straightforward string generation. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The data appears static and controlled. No signs of injection, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The small risk score might be justified as a precaution, but given the static nature, it could be lowered to 0.0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a set of test functions with inputs from controlled function calls. No external data, no dynamic execution, no malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Similar to previous, perhaps slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is straightforward test cases with static data, no external inputs, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion is correct; the code is safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is solely test functions verifying static HTML string outputs, with no external or untrusted data involved.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0. Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a set of test functions with static data, no external inputs, and no malicious intent. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**However,** the small risk scores of 0.1 in some reports are perhaps overly cautious given the static, controlled nature of the code. Unless there's an explicit concern about the library functions (`hx.*`) generating unsafe attribute strings—of which there is no evidence—the risk score could be lowered to 0.0 across the board.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk, given the static, controlled data and test context)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward test suite for a Python HTML generation library. No signs of supply chain attacks, malware, or security vulnerabilities are present. The data flow is entirely within controlled, static data, and no external or untrusted inputs are involved.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nSet all scores to **malware = 0.0**, **obfuscated = 0.0**, and **risk = 0.0**.",
