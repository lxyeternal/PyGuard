{
  "purpose": "The code defines test functions for a Python module that generates HTML input elements with various hx-* attributes for use in web development, specifically for testing a library that wraps such elements.",
  "sources": "Code reads static string literals, function calls with constant parameters, and imported library functions.",
  "sinks": "Generated HTML strings, which are returned by the functions; no untrusted external data is processed or injected into outputs.",
  "flows": "Input data from function arguments flows directly into HTML string outputs; no dynamic or untrusted sources are involved, and no external data flows into critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or unusual logic. All code appears to be straightforward test functions for a rendering library.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions that invoke library functions to generate HTML input elements with various attributes. These functions verify the output matches expected strings. There are no user inputs, external data sources, or dynamic code execution. No indication of malicious behavior or sabotage is present. The functions are simple, static, and intended for testing the library's output formatting. No anomalous or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of test cases for a Python HTML generation library. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It is safe and intended for validating correct HTML string generation.",
