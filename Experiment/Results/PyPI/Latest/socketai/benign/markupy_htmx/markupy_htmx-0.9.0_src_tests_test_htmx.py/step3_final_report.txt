{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test functions verifying the HTML string outputs generated by a library for hx-* attributes, with all data being static or controlled function calls.",
  "sources": "Function calls such as hx.get(), hx.on(), hx.select_oob(), hx.target(), hx.trigger(), hx.trigger_every(), hx.vals(), hx.disabled_elt(), hx.disinherit(), hx.ext(), hx.history(), hx.params() which provide attribute values; all are controlled and static.",
  "sinks": "The generated HTML strings, which are static or controlled, are outputted via el.Input() calls; no untrusted data flows into critical sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from controlled function calls into the HTML attribute strings, then into the el.Input() output, with no external or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; the code is straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions asserting static HTML strings generated from controlled function calls. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns. The data flow is entirely within controlled, static inputs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the static, safe nature of the code. The slight elevation in risk scores (0.1) in some reports is a conservative acknowledgment of potential untrusted input in real scenarios, but given the controlled context, the actual risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static test suite verifying HTML output with no external or untrusted data involved. There are no signs of supply chain attacks, malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the code is safe, and no modifications to the scores are necessary.",
