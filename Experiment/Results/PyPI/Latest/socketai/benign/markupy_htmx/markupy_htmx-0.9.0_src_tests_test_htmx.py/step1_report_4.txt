{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a series of test functions validating the behavior of a library for generating HTML elements with HTMX attributes. Its primary purpose is to ensure correct rendering of attributes for HTML input elements.",
  "sources": "The code reads test inputs such as string literals and function calls within test functions. No external or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs HTML string literals generated by method calls, with no evident interaction with untrusted data or external systems. No sinks involve data leaks or external network calls.",
  "flows": "Input data (test parameters) flow into functions that generate HTML attribute strings, which are then compared against expected outputs. No flow of untrusted data to critical sinks like network or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The code structure is straightforward, mainly string comparisons and function calls.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple test functions verifying the output of a library that constructs HTML input elements with various HTMX attributes. All data involved are static literals or function calls within the test scope. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or external network activity. The functions seem purely for testing the correctness of attribute rendering, with no side effects or security concerns. The code does not invoke any unsafe operations, eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. It is standard test code with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of test cases for a library generating HTML with HTMX attributes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is safe and intended for validation purposes only.",
