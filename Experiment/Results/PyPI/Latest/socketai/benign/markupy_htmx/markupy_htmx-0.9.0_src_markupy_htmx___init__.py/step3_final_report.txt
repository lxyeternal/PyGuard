  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignment only.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward version string declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. There are no input/output operations, data flows, or complex logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code is trivial and standard, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, and confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, representing a standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The initial reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
