  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the variable __version__, which is a common practice in Python packages for versioning. It does not involve any data input, output, or complex logic. No malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation features are present. The code appears to be standard versioning metadata.",
