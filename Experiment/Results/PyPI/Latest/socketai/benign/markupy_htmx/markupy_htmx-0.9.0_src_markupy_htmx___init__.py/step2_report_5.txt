  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments.\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code `__version__ = \"0.9.0\"` is a standard version declaration in Python packages.\n   - No input, output, data flow, or suspicious behavior is present.\n   - All reports correctly identify this as benign and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - They correctly state that the code is a simple version string assignment with no malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, indicating certainty, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports conclude no malicious or security concerns, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The current scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code is purely a version string assignment.\n   - No malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present.\n   - Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions and stick to the code's actual behavior.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward version string assignment.\n- All reports correctly identify it as benign with no security issues.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of this code snippet. No changes are necessary.",
