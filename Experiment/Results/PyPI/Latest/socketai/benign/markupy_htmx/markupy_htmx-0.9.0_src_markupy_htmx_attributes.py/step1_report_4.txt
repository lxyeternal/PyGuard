  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to generate and handle HTML attributes related to the htmx JavaScript library, enabling dynamic web interactions through attribute-based configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules such as 'markupy', 're', 'json', and 'typing'; functions and variables within the code that generate attribute objects based on input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Returns Attribute objects containing attribute names and values; potential injection points are the attribute values based on user-supplied inputs, especially in functions like 'trigger', 'select', 'headers', 'vals', 'prompt', 'replace_url', 'request', and 'params'.",
  "flows": "User-provided strings or data structures flow into functions like 'headers', 'vals', 'trigger', 'select', 'prompt', 'replace_url', 'request', and 'params'; these functions serialize or incorporate user input into attribute values which are then applied to HTML elements, possibly leading to injection if inputs are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. Use of 'json.dumps' for data serialization is standard; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation detected. Functions like 'trigger' construct attribute strings based on inputs, which could be risky if inputs are untrusted, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive set of functions to generate HTML attributes for htmx interactions, carefully serializing data with '_json_dumps' when needed. Functions accept user inputs and embed them into attribute values without sanitization, which could pose injection risks if inputs are untrusted; however, no deliberate malicious behavior or backdoors are present. The code uses standard modules and patterns typical for a utility library, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic. The overall structure and content appear to be legitimate for web interaction configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility library for generating htmx-related HTML attributes, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It serializes input data securely using JSON where applicable. Risks exist if untrusted inputs are used directly without validation, but there is no evidence of malicious intent. The code is safe for typical use cases, assuming proper input validation is performed elsewhere.",
