  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating htmx attributes for HTML elements, facilitating AJAX and event handling.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, user-provided strings, mappings, and attribute values used in attribute constructors.",
  "sinks": "Attribute objects with values influenced by inputs; potential injection if inputs are untrusted and not sanitized before rendering.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into attribute values via string concatenation, JSON serialization, or direct assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. No network activity or code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs HTML attributes for htmx interactions using straightforward functions. It serializes data with standard JSON dumps and concatenates strings for attribute values. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. Potential security concern exists if untrusted inputs are embedded into attributes without proper sanitization at the application level, but this is a common and known risk for such utility functions. The code itself is safe and well-structured, serving as a helper library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility module for generating htmx attributes. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is external input sanitization to prevent injection vulnerabilities. Scores are consistent with the analysis: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) reflecting potential misuse if inputs are malicious. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
