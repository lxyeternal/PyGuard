  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module or script, potentially used for data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose is evident from the provided fragment.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, imported modules, and possibly external files or network sources if present in omitted parts.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, or environment variable modifications, depending on further code not shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or input modules to sinks such as network or file operations, but no specific flow is confirmed from the fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are observed in the provided snippet. The code is straightforward and structurally typical.",
  "analysis": "Step 1: The code includes standard imports and variable definitions with no apparent malicious payload.\nStep 2: No hardcoded secrets or suspicious functions (e.g., eval, exec) are present.\nStep 3: No network activity, file access, or environment variable manipulation is evident in the snippet.\nStep 4: The absence of obfuscated code, misleading variable names, or uncommon language features reduces suspicion.\nStep 5: Without additional context, no malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious behavior or anomalies. However, this assessment is limited to the given snippet; a full review of the entire codebase is recommended for comprehensive security validation.",
