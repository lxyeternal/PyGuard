  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, data handling points, network interactions, environment variables, eval/exec usage",
  "sinks": "Untrusted input processing, network requests, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points",
  "flows": "Sources such as user inputs or environment variables to sinks like eval/exec, network functions, or data leaks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; no malicious activity evident",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign across all reports, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate. The security risk scores are low (0.2 to 0.3), reflecting minimal concern; however, Report 3's risk score of 0.4 is slightly high given the lack of concrete evidence. It is recommended to lower this to 0.2-0.3 for consistency. Confidence levels are moderate to high, based on the limited code snippets. No significant anomalies or vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The overall security risk is minimal, with a slight caution in Report 3 that can be adjusted downward. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and no further action is necessary unless additional code reveals hidden issues.",
