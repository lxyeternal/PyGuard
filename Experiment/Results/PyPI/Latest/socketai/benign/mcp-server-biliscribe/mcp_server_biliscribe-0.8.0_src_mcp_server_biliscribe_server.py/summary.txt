  "conclusion": "The code is a functional media processing pipeline with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is command injection due to unsanitized user inputs in shell commands. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be elevated to approximately 0.7 to reflect this vulnerability. Implementing input validation and safer subprocess invocation methods is recommended to mitigate this risk."
