      "conclusion": "The code appears safe and benign based on the provided snippet. The security risk is very low, and no malicious activity is evident. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, and the scores are consistent with the evidence. Vigilance should be maintained regarding serve()'s implementation, but as it stands, the code is safe."

      "conclusion": "The code is a functional media processing pipeline with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is command injection due to unsanitized user inputs in shell commands. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be elevated to approximately 0.7 to reflect this vulnerability. Implementing input validation and safer subprocess invocation methods is recommended to mitigate this risk."

      "conclusion": "This code snippet functions as a minimal entry point delegating execution to an external module. It appears benign at face value, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The overall security risk is low, contingent on the trustworthiness of 'mcp_server_biliscribe'. Further review of the 'main()' implementation is recommended to confirm safety."
