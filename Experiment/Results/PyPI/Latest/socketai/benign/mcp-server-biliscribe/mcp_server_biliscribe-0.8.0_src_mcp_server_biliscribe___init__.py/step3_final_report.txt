  "purpose": "Minimal script that imports and executes the serve() function from a local module, likely to start a server or service.",
  "sources": "Import from .server module, calling serve() within main()",
  "sinks": "Execution of serve() potentially initiating network operations or server processes",
  "flows": "import serve -> serve() called in main() -> executed when __name__ == '__main__'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures detected; code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and standard, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The actual behavior depends entirely on the implementation of serve(), which is not provided. All reports correctly identify that the code itself is benign and that the security implications hinge on serve(). The malware scores are appropriately zero, and the low security risk scores reflect the minimal code. Confidence in benign nature is high, given the simplicity. Without inspecting serve(), no further conclusions can be drawn.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe and benign based on the provided snippet. The security risk is very low, and no malicious activity is evident. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, and the scores are consistent with the evidence. Vigilance should be maintained regarding serve()'s implementation, but as it stands, the code is safe.",
