{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes a serve function from a local server module, likely to start a server process.",
  "sources": "The serve() function call, which is imported from the server module.",
  "sinks": "Potential server operation; no direct sinks involving untrusted data or system commands are evident.",
  "flows": "The main() function calls serve(), which is the only flow; data input/output details are not provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports serve from a local module and calls it within the main() function when executed directly. There are no visible signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network connections outside of typical server startup. The serve() function's internal behavior is unknown; if it initiates network operations, it appears to be part of normal server setup.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple entry point to start a server process, with no suspicious elements detected.",
