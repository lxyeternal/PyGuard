{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator 'deprecated' that marks functions or classes as deprecated, emitting a warning when they are used. It allows optional reasons for deprecation and handles both functions and classes appropriately.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the decorator parameter 'reason' (string, class, or function), and from the decorated function or class during invocation.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the 'warnings.warn()' call, which emits a DeprecationWarning with the function/class name and optional reason.",
  "flows": "Source: 'reason' parameter or the decorated function/class; Sink: 'warnings.warn()' call during function/class invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly distinguishes whether 'reason' is a string, class, or function, and wraps the target accordingly. It uses 'warnings.simplefilter' to ensure warnings are always shown during invocation, then resets to default. No external data, network activity, or file operations are involved. The implementation follows best practices for deprecation warnings. No logical flaws, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is clear, readable, and standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a deprecation decorator. It emits warnings appropriately without any malicious intent or security risks. The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
