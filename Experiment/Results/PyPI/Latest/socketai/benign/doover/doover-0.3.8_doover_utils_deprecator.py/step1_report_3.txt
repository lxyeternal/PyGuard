{
  "purpose": "Define a decorator to mark functions or classes as deprecated, issuing warnings when used.",
  "sources": "Input parameters of the decorator functions, specifically 'reason' and the decorated functions/classes.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn() function calls, which emit DeprecationWarning messages.",
  "flows": "Input 'reason' parameter flows into the decorator logic; the decorated function/class calls trigger warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors observed. The code uses standard Python modules and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a decorator 'deprecated' that can be used with or without a reason string. It checks the type of 'reason' to determine the warning message format. It wraps functions or classes, issuing DeprecationWarning messages when they are called. The warnings are emitted with 'warnings.warn()' inside the wrapper functions. No external data sources, no network calls, no hidden code, and no suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a deprecation decorator, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign implementation of a deprecation decorator intended to warn users about deprecated functions or classes. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks identified. It uses standard Python features appropriately.",
