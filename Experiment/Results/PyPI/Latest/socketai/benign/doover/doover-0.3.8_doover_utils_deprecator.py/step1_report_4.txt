{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator for marking functions or classes as deprecated, emitting warnings when they are used.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; uses the function or class being decorated.",
  "sinks": "Uses warnings.warn() to emit deprecation warnings.",
  "flows": "Function or class invocation triggers warnings, which are non-intrusive and used for developer notification.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; code performs standard deprecation warning functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a decorator 'deprecated' that can be used with or without a reason string. It differentiates between classes and functions using inspect, and wraps the target to emit a DeprecationWarning when invoked. No external inputs, no data leaks, and no malicious behavior are evident. The use of warnings is standard, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The structure is straightforward, with clear separation of cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a deprecation decorator, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It follows best practices for warning users about deprecated functions/classes.",
