{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator for marking functions or classes as deprecated, issuing warnings when they are used.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'reason' parameter passed to the decorator and inspects functions or classes it decorates.",
  "sinks": "Warnings are issued via the warnings.warn function, which could potentially expose sensitive information if the warning message includes sensitive data, but here it only outputs function/class names and optional reason strings.",
  "flows": "The decorator captures the decorated function/class, wraps it to emit a warning upon invocation, then proceeds to call the original function/class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs are present. The code uses standard Python library features for deprecation warnings without any obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a flexible deprecation decorator that handles cases with or without a reason string, and for functions or classes. It uses standard inspection and warning mechanisms, with no apparent malicious behavior. It does not include any network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration routines. The warning messages are constructed with non-sensitive data, primarily function or class names and optional reason strings, which are typical for deprecation notices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a deprecation decorator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any unsafe operations or leak sensitive data. Overall, it is safe and serves a common purpose.",
