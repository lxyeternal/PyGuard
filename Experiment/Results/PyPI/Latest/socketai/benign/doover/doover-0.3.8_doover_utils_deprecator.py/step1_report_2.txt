{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator to mark functions or classes as deprecated, issuing warnings when they are used.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'reason' parameter passed to the decorator to determine behavior; it also inspects functions or classes using the 'inspect' module.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the 'warnings.warn' function, which emits a deprecation warning when deprecated functions or classes are invoked.",
  "flows": "Input: 'reason' parameter -> processing in 'deprecated' -> decorator wrapper -> invocation of deprecated function/class -> 'warnings.warn' is triggered.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are present. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a 'deprecated' decorator that can be used with or without a reason string. It inspects whether 'reason' is a string, class, or function, and returns a wrapper that issues a DeprecationWarning when the decorated function or class is called. It employs 'warnings' module correctly and uses 'functools.wraps' to preserve metadata. No external data reads, no suspicious behavior, and no malicious intent observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a deprecation decorator with no malicious or security risks. It correctly issues warnings for deprecated items without any harmful side effects.",
