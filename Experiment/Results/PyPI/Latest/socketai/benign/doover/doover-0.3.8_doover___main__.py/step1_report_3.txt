{
  "purpose": "This script initializes logging and runs the main method of a CLI class, likely for a command-line tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data directly; it only sets up logging and invokes a method from an imported module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not handle external input or output data directly.",
  "flows": "The flow involves initializing logging, then calling the main method of the CLI class, which is external and unspecified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging configuration at INFO level and then executes the main method of an imported CLI class when run as the main program. No input handling, no data processing, no external network communication, or system modifications are evident. The code appears to be a simple entry point for a CLI application, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard bootstrap script for a CLI application with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves as an entry point to run the CLI's main functionality, which is not included here.",
