{
  "purpose": "Initialize logging and execute the main method of the CLI class when the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "The script reads the module's own execution context to determine if it is run as the main program.",
  "sinks": "The script does not contain any data sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: check if __name__ == '__main__', configure logging, and invoke CLI().main(). No data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present. The code is minimal and standard for a command-line application entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up basic logging configuration and then runs the main method of a CLI class if the script is executed directly. There is no data processing, no external input handling beyond module execution, and no suspicious behavior. The imported CLI class's behavior is unknown, but this script alone does not contain malicious logic or malicious obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python script serving as an entry point for a command-line application. No malicious activity or security risks are evident in this code snippet.",
