{
  "purpose": "Define UI container and submodule classes for organizing elements, with methods for managing children and serializing to dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to constructors (__init__), inspect.getmembers calls, attribute access within methods, regular expression validation.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to self._children, attribute setting (setattr), method calls that modify internal state, potential for dynamic method registration.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → constructor assignments → add_children method (validates names, updates internal dict) → _register_interactions (creates UI items and assigns callbacks).",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.getmembers to dynamically register interactions; no hardcoded credentials or secrets. No signs of malicious code such as network operations, file access, or data exfiltration. The regex validation for element names is standard. Commented-out code and normal class structures do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing UI elements, with standard patterns such as dynamic registration of callbacks, child management, and serialization. Use of inspect for dynamic method registration is typical for plugin-like architectures. The name validation enforces safe naming conventions. No suspicious patterns, such as network access, data leaks, or hidden code, are present. The code appears to be well-structured, with no anomalies that suggest malicious intent or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate UI container management classes without malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware or security risks in this module. The use of dynamic inspection for registering interactions is typical and not suspicious. Overall, it is safe based on the provided code.",
