{
  "purpose": "The code imports multiple modules, likely for a control or robotics system, as suggested by module names such as 'kalman' and 'pid'.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules within the same package: utils, kalman, pid, deprecator.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are explicitly present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident within this fragment; it only imports modules without processing or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "This code performs straightforward imports from local modules, which is standard in modular Python code. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious actions, or obfuscated code. The modules imported suggest typical functionality for control systems or algorithms. Since this is only an import statement block, no suspicious behavior or malware is detectable here.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided import statements, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign and typical for a modular Python project.",
