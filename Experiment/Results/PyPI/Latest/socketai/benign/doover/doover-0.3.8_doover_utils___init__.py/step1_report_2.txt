{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from four local modules: utils, kalman, pid, and deprecator.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the same package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no external data or untrusted inputs are processed",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows or source-to-sink paths are evident in the provided code",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) can obscure actual imported components, but this is not inherently malicious; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or anomalies are present in these import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with wildcard (*) syntax from internal modules. Wildcard imports can lead to namespace pollution and are generally discouraged, but they are not indicative of malicious intent. No external inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling are shown. Without further code or context, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to import statements with wildcard syntax, which does not imply malicious intent but is a poor practice. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected based on these lines alone.",
