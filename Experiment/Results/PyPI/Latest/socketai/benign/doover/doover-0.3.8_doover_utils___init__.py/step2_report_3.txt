  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe only import statements from local modules.\n- No code execution, data handling, or network activity is present.\n- Wildcard imports (*) are used in some reports, which can be considered poor practice but are not inherently malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The overall code snippet appears standard for a package's `__init__.py` or similar module.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Straightforward relative imports from internal modules; no anomalies.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, risk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Conclusion:** Correct. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Uses wildcard imports; noted as poor practice but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Wildcard imports can cause namespace pollution but are not malicious.\n- **Score:** securityRisk=0.2, malware=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.8.  \n**Note:** The risk score is slightly elevated due to wildcard usage, which is acceptable but should be flagged.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous; wildcard imports noted but no malicious intent.\n- **Score:** securityRisk=0, malware=0, risk=0, confidence=0.8.  \n**Note:** The risk score is zero, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Wildcard imports, potential namespace pollution, but no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** securityRisk=0.1, malware=0, risk=0, confidence=0.9.  \n**Note:** Slightly elevated risk due to wildcard usage, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Standard import statements, no anomalies.\n- **Score:** securityRisk=0.1, malware=0, risk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Note:** Slightly conservative risk score, acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that these are import statements only, with no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Use of wildcard imports:** While generally discouraged, it does not imply malicious intent. The reports appropriately note this.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports correctly assign malware=0.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated in some reports due to wildcard usage, which is justified but not alarming.\n- **Confidence levels:** Appropriately high, given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All should remain at 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Should stay low, reflecting that these snippets are benign import statements.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (due to wildcard imports, but not significant)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code is benign, and there are no security concerns based solely on these import statements.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** If further code reveals more complex logic, data handling, or network activity, re-evaluation would be necessary. But based on these snippets, the assessment is correct.",
