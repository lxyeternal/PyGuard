{
  "purpose": "The code imports multiple submodules using relative import statements, likely to re-export functionalities within a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .utils, .kalman, .pid, .deprecator",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Import statements serve as source points; no data flows or processing beyond module inclusion",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) in some reports, which can cause namespace pollution but are not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements, typical for package initialization files. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. Wildcard imports are discouraged but do not constitute malicious activity. The malware score remains at 0, and security risk is minimal, primarily due to import practices. Confidence is high given the simplicity and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package initialization with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. Wildcard imports are noted as poor practice but not malicious. Scores are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
