  "purpose": "This code imports modules or functions from local packages within a larger project, likely for use in control or data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing everything (*) from local modules: utils, kalman, pid, and deprecator.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks are explicitly present in these import statements.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows or source-to-sink paths in the provided code snippet; it only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) can obscure what is actually imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code. No specific malicious code or backdoors are visible in these import statements themselves.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, which is common in Python projects. Wildcard imports (*) can be risky as they may overwrite existing variables or introduce unwanted functions, but they are not inherently malicious. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious actions are evident here. Since this is only import code, it provides no evidence of malicious intent or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code only performs module imports, which by itself is not suspicious or malicious. Use of wildcard imports should be noted but does not indicate malicious activity. No malware or security risks are apparent in this snippet.",
