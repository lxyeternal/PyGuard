  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk, and verify the consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is just relative import statements from internal modules; no suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Uses wildcard imports (`from .module import *`), which can be risky due to namespace pollution but are not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** The securityRisk score of 0.2 seems to be based on the poor practice of wildcard imports, not on malicious intent. Wildcard imports are generally discouraged but don't automatically imply security issues.\n- **Potential Adjustment:** Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, perhaps the securityRisk should be lowered to 0.1 or 0, unless the report considers wildcard imports as a significant security concern.\n\n**Recommendation:** Reduce `securityRisk` to 0.1 for clarity, as wildcard imports are a bad practice but not a security breach.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, straightforward import statements with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Uses wildcard imports again; no malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate, considering the use of wildcard imports as a minor security concern but not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Import statements from local modules; standard practice, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is just import statements, with no malware or obfuscation.\n- The only point of contention is the securityRisk scores assigned to wildcard imports in reports 2 and 4. Since wildcard imports are generally discouraged but not malicious, a very low security risk score (e.g., 0.1) is more appropriate than 0.2.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** For reports with wildcard imports, adjust `securityRisk` from 0.2 to **0.1** to better reflect the minor security concern without overstating the risk.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (wildcard imports are poor practice but not a security breach)\n\nThis aligns with the assessments above, emphasizing that the code snippets are benign but could be improved by avoiding wildcard imports.",
