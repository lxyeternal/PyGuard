  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: multiple import statements of local modules using either wildcard (*) or relative imports.\n- No actual code execution, data processing, or network activity is present.\n- The code is typical for a package's __init__.py or similar module, aiming to re-export submodules.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- Wildcard imports are generally discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Standard relative import statements; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues here.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Wildcard imports from local modules; no external data or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.2 reflects a minor concern about wildcard imports, which is reasonable. No malware detected.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Similar to above; import statements only.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower securityRisk score; appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Wildcard imports; potential namespace pollution but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score is low, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard local imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher confidence and very low security risk; appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, consistent.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variation, but all low, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n### Are any issues present?\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that this is just import code.\n- **Logic flaws:** No flaws; the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- Since the code is just import statements, **malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0**.\n- **Security risk scores** can stay very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- The **confidence levels** are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to wildcard imports, which are a minor best practice concern but not a security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities from this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** If further code beyond these import statements is provided, a deeper analysis would be warranted. But based solely on this, the risk remains negligible.",
