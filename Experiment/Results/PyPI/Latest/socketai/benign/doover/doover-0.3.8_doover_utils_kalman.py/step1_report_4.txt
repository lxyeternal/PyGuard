  "purpose": "Implement a simple 1D Kalman filter for sensor data smoothing, including outlier detection and a decorator for applying the filter to function return values.",
  "sources": "Reads sensor measurements via methods like sensor_value() and sensor_value_2(), and system time via time.time() for dt calculation.",
  "sinks": "Update method uses measurement data for state estimation; no data leaks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Sensor measurement input (source) flows into KalmanFilter1D.update(), which processes and updates the estimate, returning the filtered value.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code is a standard Kalman filter implementation with decorators. No code executes external commands, network connections, or manipulates system files.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a Kalman filter class with standard filtering logic, including outlier detection, and decorators for applying the filter to functions. The main demo simulates sensor data smoothing with no external or malicious activities. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or system harm functions are present. The code's structure and logic are consistent with typical sensor data filtering use cases. The only potential concern is the use of time-based calculations for dt, but this is a common pattern and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a Kalman filter with decorators for sensor data smoothing. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It functions as intended for sensor data processing without external threats.",
