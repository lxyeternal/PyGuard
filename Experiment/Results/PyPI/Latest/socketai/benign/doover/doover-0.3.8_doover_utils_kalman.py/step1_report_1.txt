{
  "purpose": "The code implements a 1D Kalman filter for sensor data smoothing and includes decorators to apply the filter to function outputs, along with a demo class that simulates sensor data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads sensor data from methods '_raw_sensor_value' and '_raw_sensor_value_2'; accesses 'self.values' and 'self.values_2' lists; retrieves current time via 'time.time()'; reads function return values in decorators.",
  "sinks": "None evident. No untrusted input sources, network operations, or data leaks present in the code.",
  "flows": "Sensor methods produce raw data -> decorators wrap these methods, applying Kalman filter updates -> filtered results are returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No external network calls or data exfiltration routines are present. All code appears to serve legitimate data filtering purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Kalman filter class with configurable parameters, including outlier detection, and decorators to seamlessly apply the filter to class methods. The demo class simulates sensor data, applying filtering via the decorators. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data theft, or system compromise. The code appears well-structured for its purpose, with standard use of Python features. No external or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign implementation of a sensor data filtering utility using a Kalman filter. It includes no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code functions as intended for data smoothing and does not pose supply chain security concerns.",
