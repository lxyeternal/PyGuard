  "purpose": "Implementation of a 1D Kalman filter for sensor data smoothing, including outlier detection and optional filtering via decorators.",
  "sources": "Reads sensor measurements through decorated functions (sensor_value and sensor_value_2), and time.time() for timestamping.",
  "sinks": "Updates internal state; no data is transmitted externally; no network or file I/O; no use of untrusted inputs beyond sensor measurements.",
  "flows": "Sensor measurement -> update() method in KalmanFilter1D -> filtered estimate; timestamp from time.time() -> timestamp management in update().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code implements a standard Kalman filter with no suspicious modifications. No obfuscated code, misleading variables, or unnecessary dynamic execution found.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured Kalman filter implementation with decorators for applying filtering to sensor readings. It uses standard techniques for outlier detection and adaptive variance. No network calls, system modifications, or hidden behaviors are present. It includes an example demonstrating use with simulated sensor data. The code appears designed solely for sensor data filtering without malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign implementation of a Kalman filter with useful features like outlier detection and decorator-based application. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is safe to use and review further if needed.",
