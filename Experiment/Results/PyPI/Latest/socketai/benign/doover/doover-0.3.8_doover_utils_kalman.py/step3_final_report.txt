  "purpose": "A sensor data smoothing utility implementing a 1D Kalman filter with outlier detection, designed for use with single sensor readings such as voltage or temperature measurements.",
  "sources": "Sensor measurement inputs provided to the update method, class methods returning raw sensor data.",
  "sinks": "Filtered sensor estimates returned by decorated methods, no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Sensor data flows from raw measurement methods through the Kalman filter's update function, resulting in smoothed estimates.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is well-structured and transparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-implemented 1D Kalman filter with decorators for applying filtering to class methods. It includes outlier detection, adaptive process variance, and timestamp-based dt calculation. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious logic are present. The demo simulates sensor data smoothing without any malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of a sensor data filter with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal security risk score reflects its utility purpose. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.",
