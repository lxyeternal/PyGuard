{
  "purpose": "A standard PID controller implementation for process control systems.",
  "sources": "Reads input via feedback_value parameter; uses system time (time.time()) for timing calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; internal state updates only.",
  "flows": "Calculates error from setpoint and feedback_value; computes proportional, integral, and derivative terms; applies output limits; updates internal state variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution; standard use of time.time().",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured PID controller with methods for updating control output, resetting internal state, and setting parameters. It uses standard Python functions and control logic. No external dependencies or network activity are present. The internal variables and calculations follow conventional PID design. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected. The code's logic is correct and does not exhibit obfuscation or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard PID controller with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The low security risk score (0.1) in some reports is justified by the use of system time, which is typical in such controllers. Overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible.",
