  "purpose": "Implementation of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for feedback control systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time via time.time() and feedback input via the update() method parameter feedback_value.",
  "sinks": "The code computes control output based on input feedback and internal state; no data is sent externally or to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input feedback_value flows into error calculation; internal state variables (_last_time, _last_error, _integral, _last_output) are updated; output is generated based on PID calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. No external network activity, data leaks, or hidden backdoors present. The code appears standard for a PID controller implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard PID controller class with methods to update control output, set limits, set setpoints, and reset internal states. It relies solely on in-memory variables and the system clock; no external data sources or sinks are involved. There are no obfuscated language features, unnecessary dynamic execution, or suspicious code patterns. All operations are typical of control algorithms, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional PID controller implementation with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard control computations without external communication or hidden features. The code is safe for use.",
