  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard PID controller with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The low security risk score (0.1) in some reports is justified by the use of system time, which is typical in such controllers. Overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible."
