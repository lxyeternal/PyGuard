{
  "purpose": "Implement a PID controller for feedback regulation in control systems.",
  "sources": "time.time() for current timestamp; input parameters for feedback_value, setpoint, output_limits, etc.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no external data outputs or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input feedback_value and optional dt flow into calculations; internal variables (error, integral, derivative) are updated; output is computed and possibly limited.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Use of standard Python libraries (time). No hidden or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a PID controller with methods to update control output, reset internal states, and set parameters. It uses 'time.time()' for timestamping, which is standard. There are no data leaks, network communications, or suspicious behaviors. All functions are focused on control logic with no external side effects. The code does not contain malicious or malicious-looking constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign PID controller implementation with no malicious behavior detected. It performs typical control calculations and state management without any suspicious elements.",
