  "purpose": "Implementation of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for feedback systems, used to maintain a process variable at a setpoint.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as feedback_value in the update() method, optional dt parameter, and class attributes such as setpoint, output_limits.",
  "sinks": "The output of the update() method, which could be used to control external devices; setting internal states like _last_output and _integral.",
  "flows": "Input feedback_value flows into the update() method, influencing the error calculation. The output is computed from proportional, integral, and derivative terms, then constrained by output_limits, and stored internally for subsequent updates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no network communication, data leaks, or backdoors present. The code uses standard PID logic. No obfuscation or unnecessary dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a typical PID controller implementation with standard features: initialization, update, set limits, reset, and state management. It computes proportional, integral, and derivative components based on feedback and setpoints, with optional time delta. All functions perform expected tasks for a PID. There are no code injection points, network calls, or malicious modifications. The code appears safe, with no malicious behavior or backdoors. No anomalous or suspicious behavior detected. It is a straightforward, well-structured PID controller.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a PID controller with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe for use in feedback control systems.",
