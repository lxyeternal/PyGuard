  "purpose": "Implementation of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for feedback systems.",
  "sources": "Reads system time via time.time(), receives feedback_value and optional dt as inputs, and sets internal states.",
  "sinks": "Returns a control output based on the PID calculation; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Calculates error from feedback and setpoint, updates internal states, and produces control output based on PID formula.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or hidden behavior. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical PID logic.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a PID controller with configurable gains and limits, updating control output based on feedback input. It maintains internal state variables for last time, error, and output. The methods allow resetting and adjusting parameters. The flow is linear and consistent with standard PID implementation. No malicious activity or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard PID controller implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to serve a typical control system purpose. No anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
