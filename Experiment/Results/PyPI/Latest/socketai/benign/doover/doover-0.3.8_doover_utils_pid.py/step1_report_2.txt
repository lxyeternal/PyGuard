  "purpose": "Implementation of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for feedback systems, used to compute control outputs based on feedback values.",
  "sources": "Reads feedback_value parameter in the update method; reads time.time() for timestamping; uses class attributes like setpoint, output_limits, _last_time, _last_error, _integral, and _last_output.",
  "sinks": "Returns computed control output; no apparent data leaks or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input feedback_value -> update() computes error and PID components -> outputs control signal; time stamps are used internally for delta time calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard time functions and straightforward PID logic. No obfuscated code, external network activity, or hidden behaviors observed. All methods are standard for a PID controller.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard PID controller implementation, including methods to update control based on feedback, set limits, and reset state. It relies on system time via time.time() for timing calculations, which is typical. No external or untrusted data inputs are used beyond method parameters. The code appears normal and free from malicious logic, backdoors, or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical PID control implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It functions solely as a control algorithm, with no evidence of malware or security issues.",
