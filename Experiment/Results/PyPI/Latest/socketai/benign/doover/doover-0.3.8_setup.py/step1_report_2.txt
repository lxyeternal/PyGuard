  "purpose": "The code is intended to facilitate the setup and distribution of a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or outputs are produced; no data leaks or harmful effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code simply calls setuptools.setup() when executed as the main program, with no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for a setup script; no unusual or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "This script imports the setuptools library and executes the setup() function if run as the main module. It is a common pattern in Python packaging and contains no embedded malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or obfuscated components. It performs a straightforward task relevant to package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues. It is benign and commonly used in Python packaging workflows.",
