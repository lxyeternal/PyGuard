  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() within a main guard, with no arguments. It is a standard, minimal setup script for Python packaging. No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or malicious behaviors are present. The call to setup() with no arguments is typical when configuration is provided via configuration files. The code is clear, not obfuscated, and contains no suspicious patterns. The lack of parameters and the simplicity indicate no security risks or malicious intent. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero, with high confidence (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
