  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom . import *\n```\n\n**General observations about the code:**\n- It is a relative import that imports all symbols from the current package/module.\n- On its own, it does not execute any logic, process data, or perform network operations.\n- Use of `import *` is discouraged because it can obscure which symbols are imported and potentially hide malicious or unintended imports.\n- The snippet is minimal, limiting the ability to assess malicious intent directly.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies that this is a relative import of all symbols, common in package setup, with no malicious activity visible.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7 (moderate confidence)\n- **Scores:**\n  - `malware`: 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n  - `securityRisk`: 0.2 — slightly elevated due to `import *`, but not inherently risky.\n  - **Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that this is a standard import with no evident malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.2 (low confidence)\n- **Scores:**\n  - `malware`: 0 — appropriate.\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 — justified given the minimal code.\n  - **Verdict:** Scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Also correctly notes that the import is benign on its own.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (high confidence)\n- **Scores:**\n  - `malware`: 0 — consistent.\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 — acceptable.\n  - **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar assessment, noting that the import is standard but discouraged.\n- **Confidence:** 0.3\n- **Scores:**\n  - `malware`: 0 — correct.\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 — appropriate.\n  - **Verdict:** No issues; scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Recognizes the potential for `import *` to obscure malicious code but correctly states that, on its own, no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Confidence:** 0.3\n- **Scores:**\n  - `malware`: 0 — consistent.\n  - `securityRisk`: 0.2 — reasonable, considering the potential for hidden issues.\n  - **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is a simple relative import statement.\n- None of the reports present evidence of malicious activity based solely on this line.\n- The `malware` score remains at 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are slightly elevated in some reports due to the use of `import *`, but this is justified as a potential risk factor, not an actual threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** since no malicious activity is demonstrated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remains at **0**; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal code and lack of malicious indicators, a **low risk score (around 0.1–0.2)** is appropriate. Slightly higher scores due to `import *` are justified as cautionary but not indicative of actual risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is benign on its own.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable.\n- No adjustments are necessary unless additional context reveals malicious modules or behaviors.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThis conservative assessment reflects the current evidence.",
