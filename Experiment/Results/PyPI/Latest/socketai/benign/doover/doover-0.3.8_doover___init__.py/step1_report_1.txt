{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import all contents from the current package/module, which is typically used to include internal components or re-export symbols.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement 'from . import *', which reads from the current package or module.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are any subsequent use of imported symbols, but none are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing all symbols from the current package/module into the namespace; no data flows are evident here.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'from . import *' can obscure which symbols are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended imports. The code is minimal and does not show further behavior, which limits analysis but also does not indicate malicious activity itself.",
  "analysis": "This snippet consists solely of a relative import statement. It does not contain executable code, input handling, or data processing. The use of 'import *' can be suspicious in larger contexts for hiding imported symbols, but in this isolated snippet, it is a common pattern for package initialization or re-export. No malware or malicious behavior is evident, but the minimal nature limits a full security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple relative import statement, which by itself poses no malicious threat. It may be part of a larger module setup, but without additional context, it does not show any malicious activity or security risk.",
