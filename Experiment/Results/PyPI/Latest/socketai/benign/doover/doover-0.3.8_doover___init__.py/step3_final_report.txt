{
  "purpose": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the current package/module, typically used in package initialization files or for re-exporting symbols.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data or input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the import statement loads symbols into the namespace but does not execute further logic.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from . import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution and potential obscuration of imported symbols, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal relative import statement that does not execute any logic or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The main concern with such code is the potential for imported modules to contain malicious code or to obscure malicious behavior, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the known issues with 'import *' but not indicating active threats. Confidence in benignity is high, given the simplicity of the code. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign relative import statement with no malicious activity. While 'import *' can pose risks in larger contexts, this isolated snippet is safe. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
