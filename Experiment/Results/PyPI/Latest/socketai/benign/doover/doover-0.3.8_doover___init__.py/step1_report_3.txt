  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple import statement from the current package, with no additional logic or functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the current package/module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from this single line.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains a wildcard import, which is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement using a relative import. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The minimal code suggests it is part of a larger module, but alone, it shows no signs of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this single line, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The import statement itself is benign, although the use of wildcard imports is discouraged in Python for maintainability reasons. No malware or suspicious activities are indicated.",
