  "anomalies": "The use of 'from . import *' can be considered bad practice due to potential namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious. No other code present to analyze for malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "This code only contains a relative import statement that imports all symbols from the current package. Without additional context or code, there are no indications of malicious behavior. The import statement alone does not execute any code or perform any actions. It could be part of a larger module; however, in isolation, it shows no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this single import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard import pattern that is often discouraged due to namespace pollution but not malicious.",
