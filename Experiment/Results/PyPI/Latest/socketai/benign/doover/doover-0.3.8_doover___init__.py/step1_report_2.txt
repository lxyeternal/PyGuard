{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a relative import statement in Python, which is typically used to import modules or components from the same package or directory.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is a source of data input, but it does not read external or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet; it does not process or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this single line of import; it simply imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a relative import with no additional logic. The 'from .' syntax can sometimes be used in malicious code to obscure the true nature of imported modules or to hide malicious modules within a package, but on its own, this is common in package structures.",
  "analysis": "This code is a minimal import statement that imports all symbols from the current package/module. It does not contain any executable logic, data handling, or network communication. Without additional context or code, it is not possible to determine malicious intent. The import syntax is standard, but the absence of other code makes it difficult to assess any malicious behavior. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, standard import statement with no inherent malicious behavior. Based solely on this line, there are no signs of malware or security risks. However, without more context or code, a comprehensive assessment cannot be completed.",
