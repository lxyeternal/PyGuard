  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data mapping, object/key search, async handling, change detection, case-insensitive dict, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted input processing leading to external sinks; no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is utility-focused, with no evidence of malicious activity. The securityRisk score of 0.2 might be slightly high given the benign nature, but considering the potential for misuse in certain contexts, it’s acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, no malicious code, no network or data exfiltration, safe operations.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no backdoors, no external communications.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The low securityRisk score seems appropriate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data mapping, object search, async handling, change detection, case-insensitive dict.\n- **Findings:** No network activity, no malicious patterns, proper handling of async code, no signs of exfiltration or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and well-justified. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data processing, async execution, change detection, case-insensitive dict.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no network, no system modifications, standard utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is thorough and correct. The risk score remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data mapping, async handling, change detection, case-insensitive dict.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no malicious behavior, safe and standard code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid. The zero securityRisk score is justified given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports agree that there is no malware. Scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; scores of 0 are correct.\n- **Security Risk:** The overall assessment across reports is that these are utility functions with minimal to no security risk. The slight securityRisk of 0.1-0.2 in some reports seems reasonable, given the functions' nature, but none of the reports provide any indication of malicious intent or exploitable vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, readable utility functions.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Slightly elevated due to the potential for misuse in a broader context, but overall very low.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — consistent with the reports and the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a set of benign utility functions with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are, with perhaps a slight adjustment of the overall security risk to 0.1 for conservativeness.",
