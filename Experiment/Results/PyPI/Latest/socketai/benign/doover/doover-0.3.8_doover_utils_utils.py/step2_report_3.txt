  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for data mapping, object/key search, async handling, change detection, case-insensitive dict with JSON support.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No untrusted input handling, no external sinks, no suspicious behaviors, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very low security risk, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the benign nature of the code. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, with input data and internal state.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, no external network or data exfiltration, standard use of logging.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very low security risk, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's functions. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions, no network or system modifications.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no external communications, safe handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very low risk, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data processing and async handling, no external or malicious operations.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very low risk, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for data and async operations.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors, no external system access, safe logging.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, safe, high confidence (1), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned and aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis; no malicious code or behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Very low (0.1–0.2), appropriate given the benign utility functions.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent, thorough, and accurate.\n- No suspicious or malicious elements are present.\n- The functions operate purely as utility helpers, with no external data exfiltration, code obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard utility code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, well-structured utility functions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and justified.",
