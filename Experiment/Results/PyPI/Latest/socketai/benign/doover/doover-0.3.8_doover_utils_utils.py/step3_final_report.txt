  "purpose": "Utility functions for data mapping, object/key search, async handling, change detection, and case-insensitive dict management.",
  "sources": "Functions reading input parameters, object attributes, and internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data exfiltration points; data processed internally within functions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through utility functions, with callbacks or state updates as appropriate, without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions for data mapping, object search, async execution, change detection, and case-insensitive dictionaries. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The functions handle data internally, with typical patterns for async handling and state management. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple expert reviews, all indicating zero malware and obfuscation scores, with very low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign, well-structured utility functions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.",
