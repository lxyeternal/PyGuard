{
  "purpose": "The code imports the GelVectorStore class from the langchain_gel.vectorstore module and declares it as part of the module's public API.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from an external module: 'from langchain_gel.vectorstore import GelVectorStore'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external output, no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only contains an import and a declaration of __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hidden or unusual features. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports a class from an external module and exposes it via __all__. There are no dynamic code executions, no handling of untrusted input, and no side effects. The module appears to serve as a simple interface or re-export of the imported class.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a module declaration and import statement with no malicious intent.",
