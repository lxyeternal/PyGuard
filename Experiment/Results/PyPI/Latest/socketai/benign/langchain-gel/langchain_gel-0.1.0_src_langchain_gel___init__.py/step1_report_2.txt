  "purpose": "The code imports a class 'GelVectorStore' from the 'langchain_gel.vectorstore' module and exposes it as part of the module's public API.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the 'langchain_gel.vectorstore' package.",
  "sinks": "The import statement itself does not involve untrusted data sinks; it simply loads a module.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet; it's a straightforward import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "This code is minimal and standard, importing a module and defining an __all__ list for public API exposure. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. It does not contain any dynamic execution, network communication, or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to expose a class from an external library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
