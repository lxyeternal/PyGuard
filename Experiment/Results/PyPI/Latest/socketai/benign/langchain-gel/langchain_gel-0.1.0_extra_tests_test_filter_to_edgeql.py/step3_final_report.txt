  "purpose": "Unit tests verifying the conversion of filter dictionaries into EdgeQL query strings for the function filter_to_edgeql.",
  "sources": "Filter dictionaries provided as parameters in test cases.",
  "sinks": "The output string returned by filter_to_edgeql, compared against expected EdgeQL query strings.",
  "flows": "Input filter dictionaries flow into filter_to_edgeql, producing query strings checked by assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious patterns detected; straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest suite testing various filter scenarios. It does not perform dynamic code execution, network operations, or handle untrusted data beyond passing it to an external function. The external function's implementation is not provided, but the test code itself is benign. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence levels are high (1), reflecting certainty that the code is safe. Given the absence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation, the overall security risk is negligible. The only potential concern is the internal implementation of filter_to_edgeql, which cannot be assessed here, but the test code itself poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
