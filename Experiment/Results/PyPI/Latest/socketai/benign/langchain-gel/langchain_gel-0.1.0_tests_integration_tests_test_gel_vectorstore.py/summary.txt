  "conclusion": "The code is standard testing code with a notable security concern: executing an external command during module import. While no malicious activity is evident, this pattern can be exploited if the environment is compromised. The malware score remains zero, but the security risk score should be elevated to reflect this risk. It is recommended to defer such commands to explicit setup routines rather than run automatically at import."
