  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the potential for injection or malicious activity, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes that the code constructs queries via string templates with user input, notably in `filter_to_edgeql`. Highlights potential injection if filters are maliciously crafted. No signs of malicious code or sabotage.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malware detected.  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0.4 — moderate, due to potential injection risk from unvalidated filters.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  The report correctly identifies that untrusted filters could lead to injection if not sanitized, which is a valid concern. The code does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Finds the code to be a standard, legitimate vector store interface. Emphasizes safe query construction, proper handling of async/sync modes, and serialization practices. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 — appropriate.  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — code is transparent.  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0.1 — very low, consistent with the safe practices described.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  The report's confidence is high, and it emphasizes the code's standard, secure approach. No injection risks or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are justified. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, highlights safe use of parameterized queries, careful handling of inputs, and absence of malicious code.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 — appropriate.  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — code clarity.  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0.2 — still low, acknowledging potential risks if inputs are not sanitized, but the code seems to handle this well.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  The analysis aligns with the code's practices. No malicious intent or sabotage detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar positive assessment. Recognizes safe query construction, proper data handling, and no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 — appropriate.  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — clear code.  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0.1 — very low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  The report supports that the code is secure and legitimate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are justified. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, notes the reliance on template rendering with user inputs, potential for injection if inputs are not sanitized, but overall no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 — consistent.  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — code is transparent.  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0.2 — acknowledging the injection risk but no active exploit or malicious code.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  The analysis aligns with the code's structure and the potential risks. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, understandable code.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, mostly between 0.1 and 0.4, reflecting the potential injection risk from unvalidated filters, which is a valid concern given the code's use of string templates with user input.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malware present.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Security risk:** 0.2 — moderate, primarily due to potential injection if filters are not sanitized before use.\n\n**Note:** To mitigate the injection risk, it is advisable to implement stricter validation or sanitization of filter inputs before converting them into query strings.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code's characteristics. The primary concern is the potential for injection via filter inputs, which the current scores reflect appropriately. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are evident.",
