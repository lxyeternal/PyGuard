  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources; static code defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'url' field and commented-out 'long_description' line; non-standard 'package_dir' pointing to './src/data/'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. The 'package_dir' points to a non-standard directory, which may reflect project structure but is not suspicious. The 'url' is empty, and 'long_description' is commented out, indicating incomplete metadata but not malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, network activity, or embedded secrets. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning low malware and security risk scores with high confidence. The minor anomalies do not impact security but suggest incomplete setup information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No adjustments are necessary.",
