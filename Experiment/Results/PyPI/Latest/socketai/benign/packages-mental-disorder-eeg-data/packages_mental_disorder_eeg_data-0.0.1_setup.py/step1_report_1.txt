{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'packages-mental-disorder-eeg-data'.",
  "sources": "Code reads package metadata (name, version, author info), package directory, and dependencies from the code itself.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; setup functions are used for packaging and installation.",
  "flows": "N/A - setup script primarily configures packaging; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The 'url' field is empty, which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup, specifies package metadata, and configures package discovery with a custom source directory. No dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no network activity. The only noteworthy point is the empty URL field, which may be incomplete but is not malicious. Overall, the code is standard for Python package setup and shows no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It properly defines package metadata and dependencies without any malicious or maliciously obfuscated code.",
