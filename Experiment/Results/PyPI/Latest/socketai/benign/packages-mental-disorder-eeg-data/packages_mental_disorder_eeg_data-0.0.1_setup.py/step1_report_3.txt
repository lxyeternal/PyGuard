  "purpose": "Define package metadata and setup configuration for a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads package information from the setup() function, including package directories and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Reads package source files, dependencies, and metadata; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The setup script appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, source directory, dependencies, and classifiers. The package_dir points to a local source directory, and find_packages() locates subpackages within it. All fields are standard, and no obfuscated or malicious code is present. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
