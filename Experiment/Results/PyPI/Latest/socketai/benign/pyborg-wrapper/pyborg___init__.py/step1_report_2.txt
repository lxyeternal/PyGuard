{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server and handle incoming HTTP requests, possibly for a web application or API.",
  "sources": "Reads data from incoming HTTP requests, including URL parameters and request bodies.",
  "sinks": "Uses the data to execute system commands, access or modify files, or interact with network resources such as sending data to external servers.",
  "flows": "Input from HTTP requests flows into command execution functions or network calls, potentially leading to data exfiltration or remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. Unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation is not observed. The code structure is standard for a web server, with no suspicious imports or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a basic HTTP server, handling requests with defined handlers. It processes input data from requests but does not show any signs of malicious behavior such as executing untrusted data directly in system commands, connecting to suspicious domains, or collecting sensitive user data without consent. The code lacks any obfuscated segments or hidden functions. No external malicious libraries or network activities indicative of malware are detected. Overall, it appears to be standard web server code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a typical web server, handling requests and performing actions based on inputs without evident malicious intent.",
