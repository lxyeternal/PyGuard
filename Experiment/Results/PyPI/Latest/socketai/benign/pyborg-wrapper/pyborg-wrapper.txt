      "conclusion": "The reports' scores are appropriate and reflect the described behaviors. Report 4's higher scores are justified by the presence of dynamic execution and network activity. Benign reports are correctly scored with minimal or zero risk. Minor adjustments are unnecessary; the current scores accurately represent the assessed security posture."

      "conclusion": "The main security concern is the use of subprocess.run() with shell=True on unvalidated profile data, which can lead to command injection. No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk score should be approximately 0.6, indicating a high potential for exploitation if profiles are compromised. Mitigation involves avoiding shell=True, sanitizing inputs, or passing command arguments as lists to subprocess.run()."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security concern hinges on the trustworthiness of the 'pyborg' package and the behavior of its 'app()' function, which cannot be assessed here. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features."
