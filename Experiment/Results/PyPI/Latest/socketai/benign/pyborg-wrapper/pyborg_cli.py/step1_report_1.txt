  "purpose": "The code imports an application object from a local module and runs it if executed as the main program.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyborg import app; __main__ guard executing app()",
  "sinks": "Executing app() may invoke server startup or application logic, but no direct untrusted data sinks are visible",
  "flows": "Import of app object, then execution of app() function when run as main",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed; code appears straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports an application object from a relative module and runs it if the script is executed directly. The import and execution pattern is common in Flask or similar web applications. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or malicious constructs. The simplicity of the code suggests it’s part of a larger application. No signs of malicious behavior or malware are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, standard application bootstrap script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply runs an imported application object when executed directly.",
