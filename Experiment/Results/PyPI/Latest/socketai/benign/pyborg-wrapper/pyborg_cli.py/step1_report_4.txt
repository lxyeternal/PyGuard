  "purpose": "The code is designed to import an application object from a local module and run it if the script is executed directly.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'app' from the local module '.pyborg'.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'app()' function, which may execute the web application or server logic.",
  "flows": "The script imports 'app' and then executes 'app()' if run directly, which could start a server or application process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an 'app' object from a local module and runs it if the script is executed as the main program. This is typical for starting web applications or services. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads, is evident. The minimal structure does not indicate any obfuscation or hidden malicious intent. Since 'app()' might start a server, it depends on the implementation of 'app', which is not provided, but nothing in this snippet suggests malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard entry point for a Python application, likely a web server, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks evident in this snippet.",
