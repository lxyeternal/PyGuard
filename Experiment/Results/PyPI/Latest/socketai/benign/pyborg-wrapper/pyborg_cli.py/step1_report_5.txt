  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious operations",
  "analysis": "The script solely imports 'app' from a local module and executes it if the script is run as the main program. There are no embedded secrets, no data leaks, and no direct network operations or system modifications within this snippet. The behavior appears standard for a Flask or similar application entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical entry point for a Python web application, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
