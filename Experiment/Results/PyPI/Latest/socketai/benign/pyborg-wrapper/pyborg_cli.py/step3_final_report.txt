  "purpose": "This code serves as the entry point for a Python application, importing an 'app' object from a local module '.pyborg' and executing it if run directly.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.pyborg' module, reading the 'app' object; execution trigger in the '__main__' block.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'app()' which may start a server or execute application logic; potential data leaks or network activity depend on 'app()' implementation, but none are evident here.",
  "flows": "Import 'app' from '.pyborg' -> if __name__ == '__main__' -> execute 'app()'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; minimal and standard bootstrap pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward application bootstrap, importing 'app' from a local module and executing it if run as main. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The actual behavior depends on 'app()' inside 'pyborg', but the snippet itself is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or 0.1) are consistent with this analysis. No anomalies or suspicious signals are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign application entry point with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a very low risk score, are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
