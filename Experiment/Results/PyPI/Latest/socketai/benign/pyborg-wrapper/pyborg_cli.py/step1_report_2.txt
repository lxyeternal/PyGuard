  "purpose": "Import and run a Flask (or similar) application from the local module pyborg",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .pyborg import app",
  "sinks": "Calling app() as a function when __name__ == \"__main__\"",
  "flows": "Import app -> execute app() if script is run directly",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports an 'app' object from a local module 'pyborg' and runs it if the script is executed as the main program. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The structure is straightforward and typical for a web application entry point. No suspicious variables, environment variables, or network connections are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard entry point for a Python web application that imports and runs an app object. There are no indications of malicious or malicious intent within this small code fragment.",
