  "conclusion": "The main security concern is the use of subprocess.run() with shell=True on unvalidated profile data, which can lead to command injection. No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk score should be approximately 0.6, indicating a high potential for exploitation if profiles are compromised. Mitigation involves avoiding shell=True, sanitizing inputs, or passing command arguments as lists to subprocess.run()."
