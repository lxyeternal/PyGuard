  "purpose": "Minimal Python CLI entry point that imports and executes 'app()' from 'pyborg.cli' when run directly.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from pyborg.cli import app' executed when __name__ == '__main__'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'app()' function, which may contain untrusted or external code.",
  "flows": "Code flow from the main guard to the import, then to the call of 'app()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python main guard pattern, importing and executing 'app()'. All reports agree that this pattern is benign and typical for CLI applications. The actual security implications depend on the implementation of 'app()' within 'pyborg.cli', which is external. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. Malware and obfuscation scores are justified at 0. The security risk score is low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in executing external code, assuming the package is trustworthy. Confidence in the benign nature of this code is high (0.8-0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security concern hinges on the trustworthiness of the 'pyborg' package and the behavior of its 'app()' function, which cannot be assessed here. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
