  "sinks": "Calling the 'app()' function from the imported module",
  "flows": "Import 'app' from 'pyborg.cli' -> Execute 'app()' function",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, standard use of import and function call",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally executes the 'app()' function from the 'pyborg.cli' module when run as main. The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses typical Python import and execution patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity are evident. It depends on the implementation of 'app()' in 'pyborg.cli', but this snippet alone appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple entry point for a CLI application. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet alone.",
