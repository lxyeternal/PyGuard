{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to execute the CLI application provided by the 'pyborg' package when the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "The script imports 'app' from 'pyborg.cli' when executed directly.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'app()', which is presumed to be the entry point of a CLI application; potential risks depend on the implementation of 'app()'.",
  "flows": "If run directly, the script imports 'app' and executes it; data flow depends on 'app()' internal behavior, which is external to this code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "This code simply acts as an entry point to invoke the 'app()' function from 'pyborg.cli' when executed as a script. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks itself. The security concerns are entirely dependent on the implementation of 'app()', which is imported from a legitimate package. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious actions in this minimal snippet. The code is straightforward and standard for CLI entry points.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical CLI script entry point that invokes a function from a third-party package. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident within this snippet alone.",
