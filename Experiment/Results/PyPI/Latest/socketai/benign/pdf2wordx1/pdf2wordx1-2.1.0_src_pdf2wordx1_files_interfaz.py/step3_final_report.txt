  "purpose": "Create a tkinter GUI application that dynamically generates widgets (Buttons, Labels, Entries) and updates a Label based on user input when a button is pressed.",
  "sources": "User input retrieved from Entry widget via get() method when button is clicked.",
  "sinks": "The retrieved input is used in the configure() method of a Label widget to update its text.",
  "flows": "User types into Entry -> Button press triggers lambda -> calls click() with Entry text -> click() updates Label text via configure()",
  "anomalies": "No external data transmission, no code obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a GUI with classes for window setup and widget management. User input from Entry is directly used to update a Label's text without sanitization, which is typical in GUI apps. No malicious behavior, external communication, or obfuscation is present. The widget creation and event handling follow standard patterns. The risk of malicious activity is negligible; the main concern is minimal potential for UI injection, which is common and not inherently dangerous in local GUI contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured tkinter GUI application with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
