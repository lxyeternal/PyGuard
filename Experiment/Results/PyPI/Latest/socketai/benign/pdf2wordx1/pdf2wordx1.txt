Moderate suspicion in network activity warrants attention but does not confirm malicious intent. Continuous monitoring and detailed analysis of network interactions are recommended to confirm potential threats."

Reports 1 and 5 are benign. Slight score adjustments improve accuracy, with an overall moderate to high security concern due to reports 2 and 3."
