  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be the execution of some functionality involving imports and possibly data processing, but without further context, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, potentially from environment variables or input functions if present, but no explicit data sources are shown in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that handle data output, network connections, file writing, or system commands, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (such as input or environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (like output functions or external systems). Specific flow paths are not detailed in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are evident. The code uses standard language features and import statements. No unusual behavior or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting primarily of import statements and a brief structure, without any complex logic, external data handling, or network interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this fragment. The lack of actionable code limits detailed analysis but suggests standard, benign usage.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears benign and does not present any immediate threats. Confidence in this assessment is high given the simplicity of the code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
