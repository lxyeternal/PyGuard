  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for general utility, possibly involving data processing or network communication, but without specific context, the exact purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Input reading points include environment variables, function parameters, or file reads (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmissions, file writes, system commands, or database operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs) possibly through intermediate processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or backdoors detected. No signs of malicious behavior like network exfiltration, system damage, or cryptomining. Code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for typical security issues and malicious patterns. No unusual or suspicious code constructs, such as dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activity, were observed. Usage of external libraries does not appear malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe data handling detected. Overall, the code seems to perform legitimate functions without evident security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign component, with no evidence of malware or supply chain sabotage.",
