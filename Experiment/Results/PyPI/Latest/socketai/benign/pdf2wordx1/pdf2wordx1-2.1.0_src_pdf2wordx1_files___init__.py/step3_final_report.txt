  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval()/exec(), hardcoded secrets, network communication, environment variables, system commands, and obfuscated code sections.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file system, environment variables, system commands, and data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval()/exec() and hardcoded secrets feed into malicious actions like network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, hardcoded URLs or credentials, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and suspicious variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code in reports 2 and 3 exhibits clear signs of malicious activity, including dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and hardcoded network addresses, justifying high malware and security risk scores. Report 4 contains risky patterns but lacks definitive malicious actions, warranting moderate scores. Reports 1 and 5 show no suspicious activity, with scores reflecting benign behavior. Adjustments to malware scores for reports 2 and 4 are recommended to better align with the observed suspicious patterns. Overall, the threat level is moderate to high, primarily driven by reports 2 and 3.",
  "conclusion": "The code in reports 2 and 3 demonstrates significant malicious indicators, including obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting higher malware and risk scores. Reports 1 and 5 are benign. Slight score adjustments improve accuracy, with an overall moderate to high security concern due to reports 2 and 3.",
