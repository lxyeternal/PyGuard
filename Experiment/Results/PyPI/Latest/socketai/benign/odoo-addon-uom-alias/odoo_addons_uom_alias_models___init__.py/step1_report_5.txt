  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code only contains relative import statements for modules uom_uom and uom_alias within the same package. There are no other code operations, data handling, or external interactions present. This minimal import statement does not suggest malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward module import typical in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.",
