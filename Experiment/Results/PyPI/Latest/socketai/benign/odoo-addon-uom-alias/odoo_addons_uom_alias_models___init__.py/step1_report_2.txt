  "purpose": "Import modules or components named 'uom_uom' and 'uom_alias' from the current package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory/module context to import 'uom_uom' and 'uom_alias'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows or data processing occurring in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of an import statement with relative imports; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement typical in Python packages, importing two modules from the same package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks within this snippet. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or contain suspicious patterns. The minimal nature of the code limits its potential for malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard part of a Python package's structure.",
