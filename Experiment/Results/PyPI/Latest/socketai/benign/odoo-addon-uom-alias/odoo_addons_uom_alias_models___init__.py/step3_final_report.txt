{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of two modules within the same package, likely for internal use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the package directory structure to load modules 'uom_uom' and 'uom_alias'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "The source (import statement) loads modules which are then used elsewhere; no data flows are evident within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard relative import in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or external interactions. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero, and confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
