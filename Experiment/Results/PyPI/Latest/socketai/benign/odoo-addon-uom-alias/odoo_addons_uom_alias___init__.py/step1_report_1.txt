{
  "purpose": "Import local module named 'models' within the current package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'models' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'models' from the current package; there are no data flows or processing steps beyond this import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement, which is standard in Python for importing local modules. It does not perform any data handling, input/output, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The simplicity indicates it is likely a part of a larger codebase where 'models' is a module defining data structures or ORM models.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single line, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and performs a standard import operation.",
