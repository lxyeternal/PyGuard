  "purpose": "To import the local module 'models' within the current package, facilitating access to its contents.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from . import models' reads the 'models' module from the current package directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the import simply makes the 'models' module available within the package scope.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is a standard relative import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward relative import statement typical in Python projects. It does not involve data processing, external inputs, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The import is standard practice, and the code's simplicity indicates a benign intent. The lack of data flows, sinks, or anomalies further supports this conclusion. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the analysis and appropriate for this benign snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign import statement with no evidence of malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring aligns with the evidence. No adjustments are necessary.",
