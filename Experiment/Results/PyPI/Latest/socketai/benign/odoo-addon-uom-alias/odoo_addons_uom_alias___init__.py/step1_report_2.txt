  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this single import statement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement that imports a module named models from the current package. This is a standard Python practice for modular code organization. There are no indications of malicious activity, data processing, or security issues within this line alone. Without additional context or code, no suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
