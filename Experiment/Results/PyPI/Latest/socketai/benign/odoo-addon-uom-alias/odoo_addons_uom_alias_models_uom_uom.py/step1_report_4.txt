{
  "purpose": "Extend the existing 'uom.uom' model in Odoo to include alias identifiers for units of measure and modify search behavior to include these aliases.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'domain' parameter in the 'search' method, specifically looking for 'name' filters; accesses model fields such as 'alias_ids' and its 'code' attribute.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'search' method to query the database with modified domain expressions; potentially untrusted input influences database queries.",
  "flows": "Input domain filters, especially those involving 'name', are augmented to include 'alias_ids.code' matches; these modifications lead to database search queries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual language features. Use of property and method overrides is standard in Odoo modules; no suspicious external communications or hidden backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code extends an existing Odoo model, adding a one-to-many relation for alias identifiers and customizing the search method to include alias code matches. It uses standard Odoo ORM features, including property decorators and expression-based domain extension. The modifications appear to enhance search capabilities without introducing malicious behavior. No external data sources, network calls, or sensitive operations are present. The code is typical for an Odoo module extension, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Odoo module extension aimed at improving search functionality for units of measure using aliases. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and aligns with typical Odoo development patterns.",
