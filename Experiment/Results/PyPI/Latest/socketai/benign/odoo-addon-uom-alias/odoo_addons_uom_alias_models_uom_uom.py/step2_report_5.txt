  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: an extension of the Odoo 'uom.uom' model, adding 'alias_ids' and modifying the 'search' method to include 'alias_ids.code' when searching by 'name'.\n- The code uses standard Odoo ORM patterns: overriding 'search', using 'expression.OR', and adding a One2many relation.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, external network calls, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present.\n- The logic is straightforward: enhance search functionality to include alias codes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports accurately describe the code's behavior: adding alias support in search, extending '_rec_names_search', and modifying the 'search' method. The logic matches the code.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Any logical errors?**  \n  No. The code appears correct and standard for Odoo module extension.\n- **Any security flaws?**  \n  No. The code does not introduce vulnerabilities; it only modifies search behavior.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0.2, reflecting a minor concern about domain modification, but this is standard behavior and not risky in practice.\n\n**Note:** The 'securityRisk' scores are slightly above zero, which seems to reflect the domain modification, but this is a normal pattern in extending search capabilities.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5. The highest is 0.2, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, minor security considerations due to domain modification, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — minor, typical extension behavior, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\nBased on the code and reports, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard extension of the Odoo model for search enhancement. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
