{
  "purpose": "Extend the Odoo model 'uom.uom' by adding alias_ids and modifying search behavior to include alias codes in domain searches.",
  "sources": "The 'domain' parameter in the search method, and the 'alias_ids' fields related to the 'uom.alias' model.",
  "sinks": "The 'super().search()' call which executes the query with the modified domain.",
  "flows": "Input 'domain' is modified by adding an OR condition for 'alias_ids.code' when 'name' is present; then passed to the inherited search method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code logic is typical for extending search behavior in Odoo. Use of 'property' for '_rec_names_search' is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code extends an Odoo model by adding alias_ids as a one-to-many relation. It overrides the search method to include alias codes in the search domain when searching by 'name'. The method filters the domain for 'name', then adds an OR condition to include 'alias_ids.code'. This is a typical pattern for enhancing search capabilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code appears to be standard Odoo module extension code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate extension of an Odoo model to enhance search functionality. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be well-structured and standard for its purpose.",
