  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe extension for search enhancement in Odoo, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The assigned scores are reasonable; malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2). The minor concern about domain handling does not impact security. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent."
