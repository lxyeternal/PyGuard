  "purpose": "Define an Odoo model for UOM (Unit of Measure) aliases with a unique code constraint.",
  "sources": "Reading module imports, class declaration, fields definitions, and SQL constraints.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or insecure data handling; no external output or network activity.",
  "flows": "No complex data flows; data input via model fields is constrained and validated locally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and follows standard Odoo model definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple Odoo model with a character field 'code' and a Many2one relationship 'uom_id'. It enforces uniqueness of 'code' through an SQL constraint. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a standard model definition for a specific domain purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal Odoo model definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It implements a simple data model with appropriate constraints.",
