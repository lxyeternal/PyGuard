{
  "purpose": "Defines an Odoo model 'uom.alias' with a unique 'code' and a relation to 'uom.uom'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the model fields 'code' and 'uom_id'.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; no network or external data output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model input fields to database storage; no external or untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard Odoo model with a Char field 'code' constrained to be unique and a Many2one relation 'uom_id'. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The SQL constraint ensures data integrity. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code's simplicity and adherence to typical patterns suggest a benign purpose. The reports correctly identify the code as safe, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and minimal security risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1). The slight security risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting the presence of a database constraint but not an actual vulnerability. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Odoo data model with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (0.1) due to the database constraint. No modifications are necessary.",
