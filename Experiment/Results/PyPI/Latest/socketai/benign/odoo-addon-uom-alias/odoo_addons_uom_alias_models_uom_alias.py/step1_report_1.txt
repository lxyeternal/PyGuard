{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for UOM (Unit of Measure) aliases in an Odoo module.",
  "sources": "Reading the class definition, field declarations, and SQL constraints.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily defines data structure and constraints; no external data sinks or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "The model's fields and constraints flow within the database ORM framework; no external or untrusted data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual language features observed. The only constraints are standard unique constraints on the 'code' field.",
  "analysis": "The code declares an Odoo model 'uom.alias' with fields 'code' (Char) and 'uom_id' (Many2one). It enforces a uniqueness constraint on 'code'. No data input, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. No suspicious or malicious constructs detected. The code appears to be standard for defining an Odoo model, with no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Odoo model for managing UOM aliases with standard constraints. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
