{
  "purpose": "Define an Odoo model for UOM (Unit of Measure) aliases with a unique code constraint.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'code' Char field, 'uom_id' Many2one relation to 'uom.uom'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data sinks; the code primarily defines data model constraints.",
  "flows": "User input for 'code' and 'uom_id' flows into database storage, constrained by a unique constraint.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution. The code adheres to standard Odoo model definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of an Odoo model 'uom.alias' with a Char field 'code' and a Many2one relation 'uom_id'. It enforces uniqueness on 'code'. The licensing comment indicates compliance, no malicious or suspicious code is present. The structure and syntax are standard, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden behavior. There are no external input handling or dangerous code patterns. The model appears to serve as a simple data structure for UOM aliases without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Odoo model definition for managing UOM aliases with a uniqueness constraint. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
