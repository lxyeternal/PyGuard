{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for UOM (Unit of Measure) aliases in an Odoo module, including a unique code and relation to UOM.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions, field declarations, and the SQL constraint for uniqueness.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no external data or input sources are processed within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The class definition and fields establish data structure, but there are no flows from external input to data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for an Odoo model. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Odoo model with a Char field 'code' and a Many2one relation 'uom_id'. It includes a SQL constraint enforcing unique 'code' values. There are no suspicious behaviors, no code injection points, and no external data handling. The license comment indicates open-source licensing. Overall, the code is straightforward, typical for Odoo module models, and does not contain malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Odoo model definition for UOM aliases with a uniqueness constraint. No malicious behavior, no malware indicators, and minimal security risk are present.",
