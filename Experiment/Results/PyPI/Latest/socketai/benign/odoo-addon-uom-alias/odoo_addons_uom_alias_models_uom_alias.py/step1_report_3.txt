  "purpose": "Define an Odoo model for UOM (Unit of Measure) aliases with unique alias codes.",
  "sources": "Imports from odoo library; model class attributes; fields definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling, external calls, or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; simple data model definition.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward Odoo model with a character field 'code' and a Many2one relation to a 'uom.uom' model. It enforces uniqueness on 'code' via SQL constraints. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The code is standard for an Odoo model definition and lacks any malicious or anomalous patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal Odoo model definition for UOM aliases, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
