{
  "purpose": "Metadata and dependency declaration for an Odoo module that adds aliases for UOM (Units of Measure).",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains static JSON-like data and comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a copyright notice with a future year (2025) which is inconsistent with current date, but this is a benign typo or placeholder. No other anomalies or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard manifest file for an Odoo module, including metadata such as name, version, license, author, dependencies, and data files. It does not include executable code, user input handling, or external data interactions. The license is LGPL-3, which is open-source and not suspicious. No signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are observed. The only potential concern is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder, but it does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module manifest for an open-source Odoo module with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and contains no malware or suspicious behavior.",
