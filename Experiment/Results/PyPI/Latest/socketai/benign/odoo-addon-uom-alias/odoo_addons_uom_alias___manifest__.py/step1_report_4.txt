  "purpose": "Provides metadata and dependency information for the 'UOM Alias' module in an Odoo package, adding alias functionality for UOM.",
  "sources": "Reads static metadata, dependencies, and data file references; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no external data processing or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code is primarily declarative metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of package metadata and configuration data, including license, author, dependencies, and data file references. It does not perform any runtime operations, external data handling, or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package manifest.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module declaration with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is a benign configuration file for an Odoo module.",
