  "purpose": "Metadata description for an Odoo module related to UOM alias, including dependencies and data files.",
  "sources": "Static JSON-like dictionary containing package metadata; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; static data with no external communication or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow or runtime data processing; purely static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025) noted, likely a typo or placeholder, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static package manifest with no executable code, data processing, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The minor future year is benign and does not impact security. Malware scores are consistently zero, and risk scores are very low (~0.0-0.1), justified by the static nature of the data. The scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package manifest with no security risks, malware, or malicious intent. The minor typo in the copyright year is not a security concern.",
