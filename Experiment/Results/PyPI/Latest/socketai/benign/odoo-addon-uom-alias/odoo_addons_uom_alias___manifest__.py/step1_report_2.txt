  "sources": "License declaration, package metadata, author and dependency information, data file references.",
  "sinks": "None present; no code executes or processes untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No execution flow or data processing present; only static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activities detected. The file appears to be a standard package manifest.",
  "analysis": "The provided content is a package manifest with metadata about the Python module 'UOM Alias'. It includes licensing info, author details, dependency list, and data files. There is no executable code, input/output handling, or data processing logic present. The licensing information is standard, and no hardcoded credentials or malicious code are evident. The structure aligns with typical Python package setup or manifest files. Since no code execution or data flow occurs, there are no security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package metadata file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package description for a module that adds UOM aliases, with no suspicious or malicious content.",
