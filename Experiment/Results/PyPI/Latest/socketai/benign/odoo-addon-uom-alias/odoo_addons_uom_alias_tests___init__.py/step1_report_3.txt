  "purpose": "Import a module named test_uom_alias from the current package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data or code from the test_uom_alias module in the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points are present beyond the import statement.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; only a static import is performed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with only a single import statement; no suspicious or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module, which is a common and legitimate practice. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behavior are evident. The import appears straightforward, and there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code within the snippet itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard import operation with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a benign code fragment.",
