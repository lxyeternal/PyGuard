  "flows": "The source (import statement) loads a module; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with a simple import statement. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import of a local module named test_uom_alias. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The import appears to be part of normal package functionality. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The simplicity indicates a straightforward module import with no embedded malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a Python package’s internal structure.",
