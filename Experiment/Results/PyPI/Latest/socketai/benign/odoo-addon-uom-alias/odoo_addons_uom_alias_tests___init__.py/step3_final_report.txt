{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of the module 'test_uom_alias' within the current package, likely for internal use or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the only source; no external data input or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the import is static and does not involve data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import, which is a standard Python practice. It does not involve any data input/output, network activity, or dynamic execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and confidence is high in this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
