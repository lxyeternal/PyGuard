  "purpose": "Unit tests for UoM alias search functionality in Odoo module.",
  "sources": "Reads environment references to UoM records and their alias_ids, particularly in setUp() and search functions.",
  "locks": "Uses search and name_search methods on the 'uom.uom' model, potentially involving untrusted input (test data).",
  "flows": "Test input data (alias codes) from test cases flow through search and name_search methods to validate matching UoM records.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no data leaks, and no dynamic code execution. The alias codes are static and used solely within tests.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test class for UoM alias searching, setting alias codes in setUp(), then verifying search and name_search methods. It does not involve untrusted external inputs, external network calls, or data leakage mechanisms. No obfuscation, malicious code, or malware patterns are present. The test data is static, and the code is standard for Odoo tests.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for a model's search functionality with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or malware. It solely verifies internal data lookup functionality.",
