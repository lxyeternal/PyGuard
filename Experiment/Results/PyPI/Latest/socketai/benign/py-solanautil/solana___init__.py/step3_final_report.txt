{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform benign data processing with no malicious intent, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources, environment variables, external network addresses (if any), and file reads.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through network connections, file writes, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks without suspicious transformations or injections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; minor complexity noted in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no eval/exec, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign description. In Report 2, the presence of obfuscation and hardcoded credentials suggests a slightly higher suspicion; thus, increasing malware score from 0.2 to 0.4 is justified. Overall, the assessments are aligned with the evidence, and no significant issues are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no confirmed malicious behavior. Minor suspicion in some reports warrants a slight increase in malware and obfuscation scores, but overall, the dependency is considered safe. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
