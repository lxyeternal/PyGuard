  "purpose": "This code appears to perform data processing and possibly communicates with external services, but without further context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from user input, environment variables, or external network requests (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could be sent over network connections or written to files. External network requests, system calls, or data storage could be sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions, and then possibly to network or file output based on the code's structure.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures are observed. Unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated code features are not detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input from user or environment, processes it through functions, and may send data externally or write to disk. There are no signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or network connections to suspicious domains. The structure appears typical for data processing scripts. No malicious payloads or backdoors are evident. The code does not demonstrate obfuscation or unusual code patterns. The security posture appears standard, with no evident vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs typical data processing tasks without evident security risks. No suspicious anomalies are detected based on the provided analysis.",
