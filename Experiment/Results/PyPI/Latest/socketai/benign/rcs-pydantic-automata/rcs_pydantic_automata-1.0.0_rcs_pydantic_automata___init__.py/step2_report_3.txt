  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a module that imports various internal modules (.enums, .errors, .main, .scheme) and defines a comprehensive `__all__` list to specify exported classes, enums, and data structures.\n- It appears to serve as an index or aggregator for a messaging SDK or library, exposing a public API surface.\n- There are no functions, no runtime data processing, no external data input, and no network operations.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and typical for package initialization or API exposure.\n\n---\n\n### Security and Malware Assessment:\n\n**Presence of malicious code or behavior:**\n- The code is purely import and export declarations.\n- No dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, no network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature, with confidence level 1.\n\n**Obfuscation:**\n- No obfuscation detected; code is transparent and straightforward.\n\n**Malware Indicators:**\n- No signs of malware, such as code injection, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities:**\n- Since the code only manages imports and exports, it does not introduce vulnerabilities by itself.\n- The absence of data processing or external interactions means attack vectors are minimal here.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and scoring review:\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- The detailed reasoning in each report correctly identifies the code as a benign module setup, with no malicious intent.\n\n- No adjustments needed to the scores; they are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the analysis:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                                      |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                       | No malicious behavior detected; static import/export code.        |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                       | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                   |\n| Risk            | 0                       | No security risks or vulnerabilities evident in this module.      |\n\n**Note:** The original reports' scores are aligned with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The code is a benign, standard module initializer for a messaging SDK.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores. No changes needed.",
