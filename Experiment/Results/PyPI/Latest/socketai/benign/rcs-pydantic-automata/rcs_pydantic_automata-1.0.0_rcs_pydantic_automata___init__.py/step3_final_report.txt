  "purpose": "Module consolidating messaging classes, enums, and error types for API exposure.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.enums, .errors, .main, .scheme).",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "Static import statements; no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports internal components and defines an __all__ list for exports. It contains no functions, no data processing, no external data handling, and no dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or API surface definition. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for a messaging SDK, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
