{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that consolidates and exports various classes, enums, and error types related to messaging and action handling, likely for a messaging or communication SDK or application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.enums, .errors, .main, .scheme). No external data sources or input reading evident.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present. The code only defines and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; this is a straightforward re-export module.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns detected. The code only imports and declares __all__ for exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and consolidates a large list of class and enum names into __all__, which is used for module exports. There are no functions, no runtime data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of external input. The structure is typical for an SDK or library package meant to expose an API surface. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The code is clean, minimal, and purpose-driven.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a straightforward module that exports classes and enums, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It functions as a public API interface. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
