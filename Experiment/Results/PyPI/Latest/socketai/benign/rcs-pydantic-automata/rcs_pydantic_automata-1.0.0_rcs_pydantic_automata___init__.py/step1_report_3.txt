{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various components from internal modules and exposes a list of publicly available classes, enums, and data structures for a messaging or communication-related library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.enums, .errors, .main, .scheme) and the __all__ list definition.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not process any untrusted input or data; it merely imports modules and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static and primarily involves module organization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as an __init__ or an aggregator module, importing several components and defining __all__ for module exports. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations are evident. The structure and syntax are straightforward, with no obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs. The code's purpose seems to be to organize and expose messaging components without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks in this code segment. It serves as a standard module initializer or exporter, with no evidence of malware or security issues.",
