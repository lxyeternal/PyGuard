{
  "purpose": "The code defines module imports and exports various classes, constants, and enums related to messaging and actions in a larger software package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.enums, .errors, .main, .scheme), and the __all__ list defining exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input; the code mainly establishes imports and exports.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and an __all__ list, which defines symbols to be exported by the module. There are no data processing, input handling, or output mechanisms that could pose security risks. The structure indicates standard practice for Python package modules, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. The file appears to be part of a larger messaging SDK or library, focusing on defining message-related classes and enums.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It serves as a module index or aggregator for a messaging SDK, with standard import/export patterns. The code is clean, clear, and does not contain any suspicious or harmful constructs.",
