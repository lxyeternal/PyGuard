{
  "purpose": "This code is setting up module imports and defining the public API for a package related to messaging, communication, or UI components.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.enums, .errors, .main, .scheme) and the __all__ list defining exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network operations, or sensitive data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and then exposes a list of class and enum names via __all__, with no data flow or processing occurring.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are evident. The code appears to be standard package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules and declares an explicit public API via __all__. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are present. It appears to be a typical package initialization file intended to organize module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup code for a Python package, importing internal modules and defining its exported interface. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
