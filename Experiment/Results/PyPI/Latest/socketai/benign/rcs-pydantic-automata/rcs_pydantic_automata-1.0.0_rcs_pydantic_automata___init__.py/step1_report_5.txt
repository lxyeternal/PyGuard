{
  "purpose": "The code primarily imports modules and defines an export list (__all__) for a package related to messaging, location, and action info classes and enums.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.enums, .errors, .main, .scheme). The __all__ list defines exported class and enum names.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable. The code only sets up module exports without any data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be standard module setup with no suspicious code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from local modules, then creates a list of string identifiers representing classes and enums for export. No input, data processing, or external communication is present. There are no hardcoded credentials, code injection, or suspicious patterns. The __all__ list facilitates controlled exports, typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a messaging-related Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or include obfuscated or malicious code.",
