  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code consists solely of enum class definitions for error codes and messages.\n   - No dynamic code execution, input/output operations, network calls, or data processing.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious constructs.\n   - Commented-out exception class is harmless if unused.\n   - No obfuscation, code injection, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is static, declarative, and primarily defines constants.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors.\n   - No logical flaws are evident in the reasoning; the reports are consistent and thorough.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the static, non-executable nature.\n   - The overall confidence is high (1.0), which is justified.\n   - No changes needed; the scoring aligns with the code's characteristics.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - No such scores are assigned; the code is benign.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this with zero malware and security risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The code contains no malicious logic or behavior; malware score of 0 is correct.\n   - No hidden payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is static and safe.\n   - The commented-out exception class is noted but deemed harmless.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - All reports are consistent, assigning zero to malware and security risk.\n   - The analysis aligns with the code's static, declarative nature.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a well-structured set of enum classes defining error codes/messages.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable in their conclusions.\n- I agree with the scores of 0.0 for malware and security risk, and high confidence.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0.0\n- **Risk score**: 0.0\n\n**Final note**:\nThis code appears to be a standard, static enumeration setup for error handling in a larger system. It is benign, well-structured, and free of security issues.",
