  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code consists solely of enum class definitions for error codes and messages, with helper methods for lookup. No dynamic code execution, input/output, network communication, or data handling is present. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report**:  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative, with no malicious intent. They acknowledge the structure, the purpose, and the lack of dynamic or external interactions. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the static, data-only nature of the code. The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports suggest any behavior that would justify a higher risk score. The code is straightforward enum definitions, serving as constants for error handling.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the content. No malicious activity or signals are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports base their conclusions on the static nature of the code, which is correct. No assumptions about hidden behaviors or vulnerabilities are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent and reasonable, given the analysis.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a well-structured set of error code enums with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0.0\n\n**Rationale**:  \nThe code is purely declarative, static, and does not perform any operations that could be malicious or obfuscated. It is a standard approach for managing error codes in large systems.\n\n**Final Note**:  \nNo security risks or malware signals are detected in this code. It is safe for use within a larger application context.",
