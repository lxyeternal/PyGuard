  "review": "Let's proceed with a detailed, step-by-step review of the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is purely declarative, defining multiple Enum classes for error codes and messages.\n   - No dynamic execution, data processing, network communication, or external input handling is present.\n   - The classes extend Enum and str, with methods for lookup (_missing_, has_value), which are standard and safe.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are evident.\n   - The commented-out exception class is harmless if unused.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is static, well-structured, and contains no malicious behavior.\n   - They acknowledge the absence of dynamic code, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n   - The comments about the commented-out exception class are accurate; it is benign.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The overall security risk is also 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and justified based on the static, declarative nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0, indicating no concern.\n   - This is justified given the code's purpose as static enum definitions.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any harmful operations.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as non-malicious and non-obfuscated.\n   - The commented exception class is noted but deemed harmless if unused.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's static, declarative nature.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable adjustments are needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of enumeration classes for error codes and messages. It contains no dynamic or malicious behavior, no secrets, no network or file operations, and no obfuscation. The purpose is to standardize error handling, which is a common and safe practice.\n\n**Conclusion:** The source code is benign, with no security risks or malware signals detected.",
