  "purpose": "Define enumerations for various error codes used across multiple messaging and API modules, standardizing error handling and responses.",
  "sources": "Error code class attributes, class methods (_missing_, has_value), and the class definitions themselves.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of error code values and associated messages in logging, exception handling, or client responses.",
  "flows": "Code assigns error code tuples to class attributes; these are accessed or utilized in application logic for error management.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behaviors observed. No hidden network calls, data leaks, or backdoors. The classes are straightforward data structures for error codes. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. Commented out exception class is harmless if unused.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines multiple enumeration classes inheriting from a base TupleEnum class, which provides methods to check for missing values and presence of values. These enums store error codes and messages for various modules such as Samsung MaaP, MaaP Core, RCS Biz Center, KT, and KT-specific error codes. The structure is consistent and straightforward. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. Error codes and messages are hardcoded tuples, with no evidence of malicious intent. The error code classes serve as a centralized, organized way to manage error information for application modules. Commented-out exception class is benign. No external data sources, network connections, or file operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of structured enumerations for error codes and messages, serving as constants for application error handling. No malicious or sabotage behaviors detected. It appears to be a standard, well-structured code for error management without security risks.",
