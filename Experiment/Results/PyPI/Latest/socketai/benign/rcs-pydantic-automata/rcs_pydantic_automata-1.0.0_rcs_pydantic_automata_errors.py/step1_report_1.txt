{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple enumeration classes for error codes related to various messaging and API systems, including error handling and status codes.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with enum members containing error codes and messages, class methods (_missing_, has_value) for lookup functionality.",
  "sinks": "None apparent. No direct data input, network communication, or untrusted data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only defines constants and methods for lookup, no data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present. Code only consists of enum definitions and class methods.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured enums for error codes, error messages, and related constants, with lookup methods for enum members. There are no dynamic code executions, input/output operations, or network calls. The classes extend Enum and str for easy use, and include methods for checking values and handling missing entries. No malicious logic, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is purely declarative, defining constants for error handling with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be standard, well-structured enumeration code for use within larger applications. No security risks or malware signals detected.",
