  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose**:\n   - The code defines multiple enumeration classes (Enums) for error codes across various systems (Samsung MaaP, MaaP Core, RCS Biz Center, KT, etc.).\n   - These enums contain error code tuples with numeric codes and messages.\n   - The classes include methods for lookup (_missing_, has_value), facilitating error handling in larger applications.\n   - The code is static, declarative, and does not perform any runtime operations like network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Considerations**:\n   - No dynamic code execution, such as eval or exec.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive data.\n   - No network or system calls.\n   - Commented-out exception class is harmless if unused.\n   - The code's sole purpose is to serve as a structured repository of error codes and messages.\n\n3. **Anomalies and Suspicious Patterns**:\n   - No obfuscation or code complexity.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.\n   - The presence of large, static enum definitions is typical for error handling in enterprise systems.\n\n4. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - All reports (1 through 4) agree that the code is purely declarative, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks are identified.\n   - The reports consistently conclude the code is benign and standard for error management.\n\n5. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0.0 — No malicious activity or indicators.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0.0 — Code is clear, static, and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score**: 0.0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities detected.\n   - **Security risk**: 0.0 — The code is purely declarative.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The commented exception class is harmless if not used.\n   - The code could be expanded or integrated into larger systems, but as-is, it poses no security threat.\n\n**Final Justification**:\n- The code is a static, well-structured set of enums for error codes.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose is standard error code management, common in enterprise software.\n- No security risks or malware signals are detected.\n\n**My overall estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0.0\n- **Risk score**: 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
