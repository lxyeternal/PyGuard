{
  "purpose": "This code defines multiple enumerations for error codes used across different systems (Samsung MaaP, 이동통신사 MaaP, RCS Biz Center, KT), providing structured error handling and standardization for API responses.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions and class variables containing error code tuples. No input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output functions; static definitions only. No data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; these are static, constant definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic execution present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. The commented-out Exception class is harmless if not used.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions for error codes, each containing numeric codes and messages. There are no functions, input handling, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code patterns. The code appears to be straightforward data structure definitions intended for error handling. The presence of a commented-out Exception class is non-malicious and could be used for error handling if activated. No network or system access code is present. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are observed. Overall, the code is static and purely definitional, with no indication of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of static enumeration definitions for error codes used in various API systems. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. The design is standard for structured error handling. Therefore, the code is benign with no security risks.",
