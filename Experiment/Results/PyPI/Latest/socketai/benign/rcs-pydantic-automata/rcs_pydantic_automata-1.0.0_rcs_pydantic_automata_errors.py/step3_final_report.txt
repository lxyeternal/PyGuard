{
  "purpose": "The source code defines multiple enumeration classes for error codes and messages used across various systems, serving as a centralized, structured repository for error handling in enterprise applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only in the form of class definitions and class methods for lookups; no external data, input, or environment variables are accessed.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network, file, or system calls; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and declarative, providing constants for error handling without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The commented-out exception class is harmless if unused. The code is straightforward enum definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, defining error code enums with associated messages, including helper methods for lookups. It contains no dynamic execution, external interactions, or embedded secrets. The structure is standard for error management in large systems. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, static set of error code enums with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use within larger applications, serving as a standard error handling component.",
