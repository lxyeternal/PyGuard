  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines a custom exception class that maps error codes to messages via enums, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The logic is straightforward, with enum lookups and string assignments. No suspicious patterns, external data, or malicious payloads are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (low, considering error handling). These seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard enum lookups and error message assignment.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The code is typical for error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard pattern of error code validation against enums, assigning messages.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior, no external interactions, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. Matches the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, straightforward error message mapping.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious code, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. Consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard enum-based error message retrieval.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero, but acceptable given the context).\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify the code as a standard error handling utility.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is justified; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, which is reasonable given the context of error handling, but no real security risk exists.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No evidence of supply chain risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for potential misuses, but overall very low)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard implementation of a custom exception class that maps error codes to messages via enums. No malicious or suspicious activity is present.",
