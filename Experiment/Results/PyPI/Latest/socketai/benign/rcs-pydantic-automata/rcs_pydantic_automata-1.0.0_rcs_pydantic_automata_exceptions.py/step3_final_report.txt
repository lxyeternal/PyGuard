{
  "purpose": "A simple custom exception class that maps error codes to messages via enums for error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the 'message' parameter, checks enum values using has_value() methods.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; the code only assigns message strings based on enum lookups.",
  "flows": "Input 'message' flows through enum validation, leading to message assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward enum lookups to map error codes to messages, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. It relies on enum validation and string assignment, typical for error handling. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is clear, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard error message utility with no malicious or security-risk behavior. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
