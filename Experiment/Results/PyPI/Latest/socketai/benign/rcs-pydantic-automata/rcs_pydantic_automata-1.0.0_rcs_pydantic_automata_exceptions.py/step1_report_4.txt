  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class MessageException that sets an error message based on provided error code enums.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'message' in __init__ method, which is used to determine the error message.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to self.message and the __str__ method returning self.message; no external data sinks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input 'message' flows from parameter to conditional checks against error code enums, then to self.message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code relies on enum validation, which appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports error enums and defines a custom exception class. It checks if the provided 'message' (an integer) exists in various error code enums, and assigns a corresponding string message. The logic is straightforward and appears to handle error codes cleanly. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code is simple, using standard exception handling and enum lookups, with no network or system calls involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical custom exception class designed for error handling based on error codes. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign and well-structured.",
