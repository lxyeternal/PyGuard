{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class that retrieves error messages based on provided error codes from different error enums.",
  "sources": "The class reads the input parameter 'message' during initialization to determine the appropriate error message.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns a string message to 'self.message'; potential risk if 'errors' enums contain malicious data, but unlikely in typical use.",
  "flows": "Input 'message' is checked against multiple enums; if valid, the corresponding message is assigned; otherwise defaults to 'unknown'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behaviors, or malicious code present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class that uses enums from an 'errors' module to map error codes to messages. It relies on 'has_value' method for validation, then retrieves the message. No external input sources beyond the 'message' parameter are present, and there are no apparent data leaks, network activity, or malicious patterns. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious logic or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard exception class implementation for error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It primarily functions as a mapping utility for error codes to messages.",
