{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class that assigns error messages based on error codes from various enums.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'message' in the __init__ method, which is an integer representing an error code.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to self.message; potential if self.message is used elsewhere without validation, but no direct sink for untrusted data beyond this.",
  "flows": "Input 'message' flows from __init__ parameter to the error code enum lookups, then to self.message.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; reliance on error enums for message retrieval appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports error enums and defines a MessageException class. In __init__, it checks if 'message' exists in each enum via 'has_value' and assigns corresponding message strings. No code execution, network access, or external data handling occurs. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are present. The structure appears straightforward and typical for error handling. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard custom exception class for error handling based on enums. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
