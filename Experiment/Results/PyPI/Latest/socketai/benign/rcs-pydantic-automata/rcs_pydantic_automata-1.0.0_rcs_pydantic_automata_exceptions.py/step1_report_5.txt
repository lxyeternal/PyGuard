{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class MessageException that sets its message based on predefined error code enums.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input parameter 'message' in the __init__ method and accesses enum classes in the errors module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write untrusted data to external sinks; it only sets the exception message.",
  "flows": "Input 'message' flows into the enum validation checks, which then determine the exception message based on enum values.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on enum classes for message mapping, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are evident. No obfuscated or dynamic code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports error enums from a local module and defines an exception class that assigns messages based on whether the provided message value exists in various enums. It performs enum membership checks and retrieves associated string messages. The structure is straightforward and does not include any suspicious code or external network activities. No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard custom exception implementation that uses enums for message lookup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues within this code fragment.",
