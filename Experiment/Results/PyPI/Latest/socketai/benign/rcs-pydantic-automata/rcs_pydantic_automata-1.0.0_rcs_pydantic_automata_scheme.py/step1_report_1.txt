  "purpose": "Define data models for messaging, location, actions, and related information used in a secure messaging platform, primarily for RCS and legacy messaging types.",
  "sources": "Input data from API requests, including message content, user info, location data, file uploads, and action parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include user-supplied fields such as URLs, text content, and file data, which could be exploited if improperly sanitized.",
  "flows": "User input (text, files, location) flows into models; models validate and process data; URL and text fields may be used in subsequent messaging or API calls.",
  "anomalies": "The code mainly consists of data validation schemas with no executable or dynamic code. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious external calls. Usage of pattern validation for URLs and timestamps appears standard. No obfuscated code, no evident backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Pydantic data models for messaging and related actions, with validation constraints such as maximum lengths, patterns for timestamps, URLs, and numeric ranges. There are no code execution, network calls, or data leakage mechanisms embedded. The URL fields could be manipulated, but proper validation is in place. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The inclusion of 'bytes' for file uploads is standard. Overall, this is a structured schema definition with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a set of data validation schemas for a messaging platform, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior. It is well-structured, and validation rules are appropriate for input integrity. No security risks or malware indicators are found in this module.",
