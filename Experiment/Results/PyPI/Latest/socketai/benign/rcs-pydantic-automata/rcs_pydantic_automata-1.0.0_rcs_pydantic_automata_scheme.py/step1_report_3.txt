  "purpose": "Define data models for a messaging and RCS platform, including message content, actions, and system responses.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from API requests, user input fields, environment variables (if any), and JSON payloads for message content and actions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage through untrusted inputs, including file URLs, user contact info, or message content; execution points via validators or dynamic data processing.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., message bodies, URLs, user contact info) flows through validation and data models to system processing or storage; no direct external system calls or command executions detected.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious malicious code or backdoors present; all code primarily consists of data validation and model definitions. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic execution, or obfuscated code identified. Validators enforce constraints, but do not execute arbitrary code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines numerous Pydantic data models to structure messaging content, actions, and system responses. Validation rules are in place to enforce constraints such as string lengths, patterns, and conditional requirements (e.g., footer validation). The models include sensitive data fields such as URLs, contact info, and message contents but do not contain code execution or network operations. The validators are used solely for data integrity, not code injection or malicious behavior. There is no evidence of hidden backdoors, obfuscated logic, or dynamic code execution. The presence of URL and file fields warrants cautious handling of external URLs, but no malicious intent is apparent in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code consists primarily of data model definitions with validation rules for a messaging platform. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows within this code fragment. It appears to be a well-structured, standard implementation of request/response schemas for a messaging API. Risk of malicious activity is low, provided external URLs and inputs are properly sanitized during runtime.",
