{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for constructing RCS message objects with various parameters, mainly for messaging services.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from constructor (message_info, body, agency_key, brand_key, etc.), environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data handling points such as network calls, file writes, or command execution are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into object attributes; methods generate structured data (dicts) for messaging purposes. No untrusted data is directly used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic code execution. No cryptographic or eval-like functions are used.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs data models for messaging, using UUIDs for message IDs and conditional logic for attribute setting. No input validation or sanitization is explicitly visible, but the data is mainly assigned to data structures. No external network calls, file system operations, or command executions are evident. The code appears to be a standard data container class, with logic to assemble messaging info. It does not handle sensitive data insecurely, nor does it include code that could be exploited for injection or remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It is a straightforward data structure builder for messaging with no suspicious or security-compromising operations. No security risks are evident.",
