{
  "purpose": "This code constructs an RCS message object with various parameters, including message info, body, and metadata, for sending via an RCS platform.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as message_info, body, agency_key, brand_key, and optional fields like agency_id, cdr_id, footer, etc.",
  "sinks": "Methods like make_rcs_info and make_common_info that generate dictionaries for message metadata, potentially exposing data if used improperly; no direct external sinks like network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into object properties, then into methods like make_rcs_info and make_common_info, which generate dictionaries for message payloads. No external data sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or misleading variable names. The code mainly constructs data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for constructing RCS message objects with various configurable parameters. It generates unique message IDs using uuid.uuid4(), which is standard. The methods assemble nested data structures for message metadata, considering optional fields and legacy info. There are no indications of malicious code such as network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The overall structure is consistent with a message builder pattern, and no suspicious or anomalous behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate message construction utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply assembles data objects for RCS messaging, following typical patterns without any suspicious behavior.",
