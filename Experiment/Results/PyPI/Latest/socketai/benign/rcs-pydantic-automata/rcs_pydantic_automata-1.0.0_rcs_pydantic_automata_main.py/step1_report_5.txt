{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class RcsMessage for constructing and managing RCS (Rich Communication Services) message objects with various configurations.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters such as message_info, body, agency_key, brand_key, and optional parameters like agency_id, cdr_id, footer, etc.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the generation of UUIDs, assignment of user input data to object properties, and serialization via model_dump() which could potentially expose data if misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through object initialization, UUID generation, conditional property setting, and ultimately serialization with model_dump(), but no external untrusted data flows to network or file system are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs dynamic data structure creation with no evident hardcoded secrets, and no unsafe eval or dynamic code execution. Usage of UUIDs is standard for message identification. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The class constructor accepts numerous parameters, including user data, message details, and configuration options. It generates UUIDs for message IDs, constructs nested data models, and conditionally sets attributes based on parameters. There are no signs of data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic. The use of model_dump() indicates serialization of internal data, which should be safe assuming model definitions are secure. No external network connections, file access, or code injection points are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured message object builder with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical data structure initializer for RCS messages with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard Python features and does not contain malware or suspicious logic.",
