  "purpose": "This code defines a class for constructing RCS messages with various configurable attributes, primarily for messaging or notification systems.",
  "sources": "User-provided data: message_info, body, agency_key, brand_key, agency_id, message_group_id, footer, cdr_id, copy_allowed, buttons, chips, legacy, replyId.",
  "sinks": "None directly; data is assembled into data models and returned as dictionaries, with no direct data transmission or external effects shown.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., message_info, agency_key, etc.) -> processed via class methods -> assembled into data models (scheme.*) -> returned as dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Usage of UUIDs for msgId is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs structured data objects for messaging, utilizing input parameters and internal methods. It employs UUIDs for message IDs and conditionally includes optional fields based on input. The use of external enums and scheme models appears standard. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. All data handling seems to be within the scope of message construction. No suspicious or malicious logic, such as code injection, secret leaks, or unauthorized access, is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a message construction class with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It handles input data securely, assembling it into structured models without performing any dangerous operations.",
