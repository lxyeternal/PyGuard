{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for constructing and managing RCS message objects, including generating message metadata and configuration details.",
  "sources": "User input: message_info, body, agency_key, brand_key, and optional fields like agency_id, message_group_id, footer, cdr_id, copy_allowed, buttons, chips, legacy. Also, external enums and scheme modules are used.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the generation of UUIDs, use of external enums, and dumping of model data via model_dump(). No data is transmitted externally or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input data from message_info, body, and optional parameters flow into object attributes; then make_common_info() and make_rcs_info() generate dictionaries; finally, make_send_info() constructs the SendInfo object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual code patterns are evident. The code mainly performs data structure assembly. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic found.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a message object with various parameters, generates UUIDs for message IDs, and constructs nested data models for message sending. It uses external enums for configuration, with conditional logic to set specific fields based on input parameters. All data manipulations appear standard, focusing on data encapsulation and object construction. No network activity, data leaks, or code injection vectors are present. The use of model_dump() to serialize objects is typical in such data handling scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for constructing RCS messages with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It primarily handles data organization and object creation without external system interactions or sensitive data exposure.",
