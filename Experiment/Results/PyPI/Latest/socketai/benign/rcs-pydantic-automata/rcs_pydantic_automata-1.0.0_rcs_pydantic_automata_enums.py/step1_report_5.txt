{
  "purpose": "Defines various enumerations for message types, service types, actions, statuses, and other constants used in a messaging or RCS system.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and enum declarations; no external input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; mainly static constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions with static string or integer values, serving as constants for a messaging framework. There are no input/output operations, no network communication, no file handling, and no dynamic code execution. All enums appear to categorize message types, service options, actions, statuses, and other constants. No credentials, secrets, or sensitive data are embedded. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of enumeration definitions serving as constants in a messaging system. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe and likely part of a larger, well-defined messaging SDK or application.",
