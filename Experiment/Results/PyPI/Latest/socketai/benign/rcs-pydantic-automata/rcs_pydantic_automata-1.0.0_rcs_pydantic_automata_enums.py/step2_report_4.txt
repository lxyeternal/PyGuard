  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static enum class definitions, with no dynamic behavior, input handling, or external data processing.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security-sensitive operations.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in their conclusions.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0.0`, `obfuscated: 0.0`, and `securityRisk: 0.0`.\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on zero risk and no malicious activity, there's no justification for higher scores.\n   - The code appears safe, with no potential for exploitation or harm.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent or behavior.\n   - The code is purely declarative.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the static nature of the code.\n   - No overreach or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's static, non-malicious nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0.0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0.0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at **0.0**.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\nGiven the static enum definitions, no external inputs, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns, the code is benign. It functions as a configuration/constants module for a messaging system, which is standard practice.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric            | Suggested Score | Justification                                                  |\n|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0.0               | No malicious code or behavior present                            |\n| Obfuscated        | 0.0               | Clear, straightforward enum definitions                         |\n| Security Risk     | 0.0               | No vulnerabilities, secrets, or exploitable patterns          |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and free from security issues. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
