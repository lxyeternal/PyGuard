{
  "purpose": "Define various enumerations for message, service, header, action, status, and other related constants used in a messaging or communication system.",
  "sources": "The code defines enumeration classes and their members; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs, such as network calls, file writes, or environment variable access, are present.",
  "flows": "The code consists solely of static class definitions; no data flow or execution flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. All enumerations appear to define static constants for messaging operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward collection of enum class definitions used for message types, service types, statuses, actions, and other constants in a messaging context. It contains no functions, external calls, input handling, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior. The purpose appears to be organizing constants for use elsewhere in the system. No malicious or suspicious code elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard enumeration definitions module with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It simply defines constants for use in messaging or service logic. No supply chain security issues are identified.",
