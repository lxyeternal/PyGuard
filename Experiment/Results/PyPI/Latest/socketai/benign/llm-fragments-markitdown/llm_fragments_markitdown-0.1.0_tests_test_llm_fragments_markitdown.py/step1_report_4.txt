{
  "purpose": "The code tests the functionality of the markitdown_loader function to load an HTML file and produce a fragment object.",
  "sources": "Reading a local HTML file via tmp_path / 'sample.html' and passing its path as a string to markitdown_loader.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data is written out or transmitted. The code only processes a local file and checks its content.",
  "flows": "Reads file content from a temporary local HTML file, passes file path as a string to markitdown_loader, and inspects the resulting fragment object.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and typical for a test case.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a temporary HTML file, writes sample content, and invokes markitdown_loader with the file path. It then verifies the returned fragment's type, source attribute, and content. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. Usage appears to be a standard test scenario for a loader function.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test case for the markitdown_loader function. It reads a local file, checks the output object, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
