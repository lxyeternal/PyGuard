{
  "purpose": "Test function to verify the behavior of markitdown_loader with a local HTML file.",
  "sources": "Reading the local HTML file from the filesystem via 'tmp_path / \"sample.html\"' and passing its path to markitdown_loader.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to data leaks or execution; no network, eval, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "File is created and written to; path is passed to markitdown_loader; the resulting fragment is checked for expected type and content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution or external data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a temporary HTML file, writes static HTML content, then loads this file using the 'markitdown_loader' function from an imported module. It verifies the returned object type and content integrity with straightforward assertions. The code does not include external network calls, eval, or dangerous file operations. The only input is a local temporary file with static content, and the process appears standard for a test setup. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple test routine that loads a local HTML file and performs basic assertions. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
