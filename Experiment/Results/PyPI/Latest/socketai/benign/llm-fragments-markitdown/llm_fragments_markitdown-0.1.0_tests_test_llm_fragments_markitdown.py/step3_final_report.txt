  "purpose": "Test the functionality of markitdown_loader with a local HTML file and verify the returned Fragment object.",
  "sources": "Reading the temporary HTML file created within the test.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data sinks; only internal assertions and object property checks.",
  "flows": "File creation -> markitdown_loader processing -> Fragment object creation -> assertions on Fragment properties.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses static, local files with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a static HTML file, loads it via markitdown_loader, and performs assertions on the resulting Fragment object. No network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present. The test is standard, and the implementation details of markitdown_loader are not shown but are presumed safe based on the context. The code does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the analysis. Given the benign nature of the code, no modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe unit test verifying local file processing with no malicious or security concerns. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
