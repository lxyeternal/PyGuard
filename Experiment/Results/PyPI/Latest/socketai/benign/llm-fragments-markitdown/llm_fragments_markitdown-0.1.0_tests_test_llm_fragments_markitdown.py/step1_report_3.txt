{
  "purpose": "The code tests the 'markitdown_loader' function by creating a local HTML file and verifying that it loads correctly into a Fragment object.",
  "sources": "Reading from the temporary HTML file created during the test (`sample_file`), and the import of the 'llm' module.",
  "sinks": "The code converts the fragment to a string and performs assertions, but does not write to or execute untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "File creation and writing -> Calling 'markitdown_loader' with file path -> Receiving a Fragment object -> String conversion and assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious operations are present. The test appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a temporary HTML file, loads it via 'markitdown_loader', and performs basic assertions to verify correct loading and content. No user input is processed dynamically; no external network calls or data manipulation occurs. The imports are standard and do not indicate malicious activity. The test code operates locally, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test for a loader function, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely verifies file loading and content handling.",
