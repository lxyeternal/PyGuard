{
  "purpose": "The code is a test function designed to verify the behavior of the 'markitdown_loader' function when processing a local HTML file.",
  "sources": "The code reads a file from the filesystem ('sample.html') created temporarily, and passes its path to 'markitdown_loader'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any sensitive operations like network access, database queries, or data leaks. The only output is the creation and verification of an object 'fragment'.",
  "flows": "Input source: Temporary HTML file → 'markitdown_loader' processing → returned 'fragment' object with properties and string conversion for content check.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The 'markitdown_loader' function's implementation is not shown, so its behavior cannot be fully assessed, but the current code does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a simple HTML file locally and loads it using 'markitdown_loader'. It then verifies the returned object type, source attribute, and checks for specific content. The structure is typical for a unit test. No suspicious behavior, external connections, or obfuscated code are present. The focus is solely on verifying loader functionality with a local file.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code snippet. It appears to be a straightforward unit test for a loader function, with no signs of malware or security threats.",
