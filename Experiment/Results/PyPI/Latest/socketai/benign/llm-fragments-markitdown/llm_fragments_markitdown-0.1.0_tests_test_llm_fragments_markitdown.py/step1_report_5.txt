{
  "purpose": "The code tests the 'markitdown_loader' function by loading a local HTML file and verifying its content and object properties.",
  "sources": "The code reads a local HTML file created during the test (sample_file).",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to pass untrusted data to dangerous sinks like network transmission, system commands, or insecure database queries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the creation of the sample HTML file to the 'markitdown_loader' function, then to assertions that verify the object type, source attribute, and string content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns observed. The test function is straightforward and only operates on a local temporary file. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test function that creates a temporary HTML file with simple content. It then loads this file using 'markitdown_loader' and performs assertions to verify the object type, source attribute, and content presence. The function is intended for testing the loader's basic functionality. No external data sources, network interactions, or dangerous code constructs are present. The 'llm' and 'llm_fragments_markitdown' modules are imported, but their internals are not shown, and nothing indicates malicious behavior within this test. Overall, the code appears safe and standard for a unit test.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for a file loader function, operating solely on local test data. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
