  "sources": "No data sources; only a comment string present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code contains only a comment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is purely a comment with no executable or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-executable comment describing a test suite. No functions, data handling, or external interactions are present. The absence of code, data flows, or suspicious patterns indicates a benign nature. All previous reports correctly identify this, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no anomalies or indicators of malicious intent. The code's simplicity and lack of executable content justify the scores and conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, consisting only of a descriptive comment. There are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation present. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
