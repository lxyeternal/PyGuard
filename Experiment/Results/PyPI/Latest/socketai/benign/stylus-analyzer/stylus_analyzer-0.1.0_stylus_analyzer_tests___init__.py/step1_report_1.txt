  "anomalies": "Lack of executable code; only a descriptive comment with no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment line describing a test suite for Stylus Analyzer. There are no functions, imports, data handling, or executable statements. Without any active code, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. The absence of code means there is no potential for malicious behavior or security issues. The snippet is very minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only a comment with no executable or sensitive parts. It poses no security risks or malware threat. The overall assessment is that it is benign, with zero suspicion of malicious intent.",
