  "purpose": "Command-line interface for analyzing Stylus/Rust contracts using AI models, managing file collection, analysis, and output.",
  "sources": "collect_project_files, read_file_content, AIAnalyzer.analyze_contract, open() for reading and writing files",
  "sinks": "open() calls for reading/writing files, click.echo for output display, sys.exit for terminating execution",
  "flows": "collect_project_files and read_file_content supply data to analyze_contract; output is printed or saved to files",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors identified. Use of standard libraries and clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs file collection, content reading, and invoking an AI-based analyzer for security review. No unsafe or malicious system calls are present. No evident data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Use of external libraries appears benign, and input/output operations are straightforward. No obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard CLI tool designed for analysis tasks with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It securely handles files, uses clear logging, and employs conventional practices. The overall security risk is minimal, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
