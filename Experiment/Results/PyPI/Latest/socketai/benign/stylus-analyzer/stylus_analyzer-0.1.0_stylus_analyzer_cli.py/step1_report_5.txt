  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for analyzing Rust contracts within Stylus projects using an AI model.",
  "sources": "User-provided file paths (project_dir, file_path, readme, output), command-line arguments, and environment variables for configuration.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations for analysis results, potential user input via CLI arguments.",
  "flows": "Input file paths -> read_file_content() -> AIAnalyzer.analyze_contract() -> output (file or console)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or hidden dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly orchestrates project file collection, AI analysis invocation, and result display/save. It uses external modules ('stylus_analyzer.ai_analyzer' and 'file_utils') which are assumed to be standard utility modules. The command-line arguments and file handling are straightforward. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. The AI analysis is invoked via a method call, with no dynamic code execution or network activity visible in this snippet. The code adheres to typical CLI pattern with proper exception handling. No suspicious code patterns or malicious logic are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI tool for analysis purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks within the provided source. It relies on external modules for core functionalities, which are assumed safe. Overall, it does not contain malware or malicious behaviors.",
