  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for analyzing Rust contracts in Stylus projects using AI backend",
  "sources": "Reads project directory, contract files, and optional README; invokes AIAnalyzer for analysis",
  "sinks": "Outputs analysis results to console or file; interacts with external AI API via AIAnalyzer",
  "flows": "Collects files -> reads content -> passes to AIAnalyzer -> receives analysis -> displays or saves results",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; external API usage is standard but raises privacy considerations",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool orchestrating file collection, reading, and analysis via an external AI service. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External API calls are legitimate but should be scrutinized for privacy; no unsafe data flows or code injection points are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The external API interaction is standard for AI analysis tools and does not constitute malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to data privacy, and the code structure is clear and straightforward.",
