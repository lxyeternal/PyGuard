{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface for analyzing Rust contracts within Stylus projects, utilizing an AI-based analyzer to detect issues or bugs.",
  "sources": "Reads project directory contents, reads individual contract files, reads README files if specified, and receives command-line arguments for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Outputs analysis results to console or saves them into specified output files.",
  "flows": "Reads project files and optional README, passes content to AIAnalyzer for analysis, then outputs or saves analysis results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. Usage of standard libraries and CLI tools appears normal. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around the AIAnalyzer for analyzing Rust contracts. It collects files, reads content, and displays or saves analysis output. No external or untrusted data processing beyond reading local files. No network activity, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are evident. The code appears well-structured and uses standard libraries with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided script functions as a legitimate CLI tool for contract analysis, with no detectable malicious intent or security risks. It strictly handles file I/O and calls an external AI component, which is not inherently suspicious.",
