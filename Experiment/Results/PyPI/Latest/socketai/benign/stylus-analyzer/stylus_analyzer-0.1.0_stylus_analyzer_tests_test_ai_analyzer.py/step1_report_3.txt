{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the AIAnalyzer class in the stylus_analyzer module, including prompt preparation, API interaction, and error handling.",
  "sources": "os.environ (for API key), mock.patch (for mocking external dependencies), and internal methods of AIAnalyzer (like _prepare_prompt and analyze_contract).",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not perform any untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Environment variable for API key flows into AIAnalyzer setup; test inputs flow through prompt preparation and API call; mock responses flow back into test assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are observed. No hardcoded credentials other than the test API key, which is typical in test code.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard unit testing for a class that interacts with an external API. It mocks environment variables and API calls properly, with no unusual code constructs. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code structure is typical of test suites and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal test suite for the AIAnalyzer class. It does not exhibit any malicious or security-risk behaviors. It uses standard mocking techniques for testing API interactions and environment variables. No security concerns are identified.",
