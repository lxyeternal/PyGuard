  "purpose": "Test suite for the AIAnalyzer class, verifying prompt preparation, API interaction, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'OPENAI_API_KEY', imported modules, mocked API responses",
  "sinks": "API call via 'chat.completions.create'",
  "flows": "Environment variable -> API call; prompt data -> API response; mocked responses back to test assertions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard mocking and testing practices; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets beyond test API key",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite employing mocks for environment variables and external API calls. No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The environment variable is used solely within a test context, and API responses are mocked to prevent real network interactions. The structure and logic are typical for testing modules, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free from malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action is necessary.",
