  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for AI-based analysis of Rust contracts. No malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior is detected. The minimal security risk score of approximately 0.1 is justified by external API dependency and environment variable handling, which are standard practices. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
