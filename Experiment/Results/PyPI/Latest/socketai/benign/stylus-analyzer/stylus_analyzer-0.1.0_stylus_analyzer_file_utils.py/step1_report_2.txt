  "purpose": "Utility functions for locating Rust contract files, README files, and collecting project-related files in a Stylus Analyzer project.",
  "sources": "Reading file contents via open() in read_file_content(), checking file existence with os.path.exists(), glob.glob() for pattern matching files.",
  "sinks": "None of the file reading or pattern matching functions write or process untrusted data in a way that would lead to security vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "flows": "File paths are constructed from user-supplied directory input; file contents are read from these paths but not processed insecurely or executed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code patterns. The code handles file operations safely and predictably.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file system searches and reads, using standard libraries and safe practices. No external data is executed or transmitted. It manages errors gracefully, printing errors without executing or leaking sensitive info. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard utility for file discovery and reading within a project. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe for use in a supply chain context.",
