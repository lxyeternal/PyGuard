  "sources": [
    "os.path.join() for constructing file paths",
    "glob.glob() for pattern-based file searching",
    "os.path.exists() for checking file existence",

  "sinks": [
    "read_file_content() which reads file data into memory"

  "flows": [
    "find_rust_contracts() uses glob patterns to locate .rs files and returns their paths",
    "collect_project_files() calls find_rust_contracts(), then reads each file's content via read_file_content()",
    "find_readme() searches for README files, then reads content if found",
    "collect_project_files() consolidates file paths and contents into a dictionary"
  ],
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code primarily performs file system operations and content reading.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward file searching and reading functions: it locates Rust contract files based on common directory patterns, reads file contents with exception handling, and searches for README files. It then aggregates these into a project data structure. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The functions are typical for static code analysis or project setup routines, with no suspicious behaviors or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of utility functions for file operations in a project context. It does not contain any malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The code performs expected file system operations without any signs of malicious activity. It appears to be a benign component of a larger analysis tool.",
