  "purpose": "Utility functions for locating Rust source files and README files within a project directory, reading their contents, and aggregating this data for analysis.",
  "sources": "Directory path input; glob patterns for file matching; file existence checks; file reading operations.",
  "sinks": "Reading local files based on user-supplied directory paths; no external data transmission or code execution.",
  "flows": "Input directory -> pattern matching with glob -> file existence check -> reading file contents -> aggregation into dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward filesystem operations; minimal error handling via print statements.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem searches for Rust source files and README files, reading their contents safely with exception handling. It does not execute or transmit data externally, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. The logic is correct, and the functions are typical for static project analysis. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The only minor concern is that it reads arbitrary files based on user input paths, which could lead to data leakage if paths are malicious, but this is a common filesystem operation and not malicious in itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for locating and reading project files. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and justified, with a slight increase in security risk reflecting the minimal potential for reading arbitrary files based on untrusted input.",
