  "purpose": "Utility functions for locating Rust contract files, reading file contents, and collecting project-related files within a Stylus Analyzer project.",
  "sources": "User-specified directory input, glob pattern matching for file discovery, filesystem existence checks, and file reading functions.",
  "sinks": "Reading file contents; no untrusted data output or external network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Directory input -> glob pattern matching -> file discovery -> file reading -> content storage in dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. The print statement for error logging is benign and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem operations: locating files with specific patterns, reading their contents, and handling errors gracefully. It searches for Rust source files and README files, and aggregates their contents into a dictionary. There are no external network calls, no code injection points, and no handling of untrusted data beyond reading local files. The error handling is minimal and does not indicate malicious intent. The functions are straightforward and conform to typical utility scripts without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for file discovery and reading within a project directory. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The functions do not perform any external communication, credential handling, or code execution. Overall security risk is very low.",
