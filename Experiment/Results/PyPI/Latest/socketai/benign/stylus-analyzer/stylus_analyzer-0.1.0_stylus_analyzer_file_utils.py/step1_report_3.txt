  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures. The print statement for error logging is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file system operations: searching for files matching specific patterns, reading file contents, and logging errors if reading fails. It uses common Python modules os, glob, and standard exception handling. No user input or external untrusted data influences these operations, nor are there any signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The functions are straightforward and serve a file discovery and reading purpose without involving sensitive data handling beyond basic file I/O.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard file system searches and reads for project-related files. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks present.",
