  "purpose": "Utility functions for file operations in the Stylus Analyzer to find Rust contract files, read files, find README files, and collect project files.",
  "sources": "Reads file paths from the filesystem, checks for existence of README files, reads content from files using open().",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write untrusted data or send data externally. The only potential concern could be reading arbitrary files, which could lead to data leakage if input paths are maliciously supplied, but this is limited to filesystem access without external network activity.",
  "flows": "File paths are generated and used to read files; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks such as network or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code performs standard filesystem operations with proper error handling for reading files. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for locating Rust contract files and README files within specified directories, reading their contents, and collecting project-related files. It uses glob patterns and standard open() calls with error handling. No external network communication, code injection, or suspicious data processing occurs. The operations are typical for a project file manager. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate utility functions for file handling within a project. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply reads files from the filesystem based on provided directory paths.",
