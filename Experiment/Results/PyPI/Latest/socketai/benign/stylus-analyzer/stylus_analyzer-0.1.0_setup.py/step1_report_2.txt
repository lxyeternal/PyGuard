  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the stylus-analyzer Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Directly in the setup() function call, including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Potentially in open('README.md').read() which reads a file for long description; other than that, no data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "From source data (e.g., file system for README.md) into package setup metadata; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; standard setup.py configuration. The open() call assumes a safe, local README.md file.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup.py configuration used for packaging. It defines package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. The only dynamic operation is reading the README.md file for long description, which is typical and safe. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. All dependencies are static strings. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code, malicious data flows, or malicious actions.",
