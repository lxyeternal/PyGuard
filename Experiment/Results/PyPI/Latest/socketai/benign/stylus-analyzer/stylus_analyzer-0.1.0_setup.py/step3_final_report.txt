  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the Python package 'stylus-analyzer', defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks; no network or malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open(\"README.md\").read()' without exception handling, but this is typical in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static 'setup.py' script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated elements. All dependencies are fixed versions, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The use of 'open' without exception handling is common but minor. No malicious or security-compromising code is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
