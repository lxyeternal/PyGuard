  "purpose": "Declare the version of the Stylus Analyzer tool, an AI-powered bug detection utility for Stylus/Rust contracts.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources identified in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data output, network, or file writing sinks identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flows present; the code consists solely of a version string declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of any operational code, logic, or suspicious constructs; only a version variable is defined.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a docstring describing the tool's purpose and a version variable. There are no executable statements, data handling, or external interactions. The code appears to be a minimal, initial setup snippet with no malicious activity, suspicious code, or obfuscation. No sources or sinks are present, and the structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple version declaration with descriptive metadata. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign, introductory snippet for a larger project.",
