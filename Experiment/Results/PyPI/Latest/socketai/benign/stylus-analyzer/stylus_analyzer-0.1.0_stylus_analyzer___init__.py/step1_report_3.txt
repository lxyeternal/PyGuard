  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, containing only a version string declaration and a comment describing the tool; no suspicious or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is extremely minimal, consisting solely of a comment and a version string declaration. There are no input sources, data handling, or execution logic. The comment indicates a description of the tool's purpose but does not include any code that could perform malicious actions or contain security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply documents the version of the software without any executable logic or external data interactions.",
