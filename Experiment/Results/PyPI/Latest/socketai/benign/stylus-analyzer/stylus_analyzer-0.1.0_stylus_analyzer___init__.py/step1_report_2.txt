  "purpose": "Declare the version of the Stylus Analyzer tool, which is an AI-powered bug detection utility for Stylus/Rust contracts.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output functions, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is only a version declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, containing only a docstring and a version string; no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a descriptive comment and a version variable assignment. There are no inputs, outputs, external dependencies, or executable logic present. The content indicates an intent to identify itself as a tool for analyzing Stylus/Rust contracts, but the code itself does not perform any actions or contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple, harmless version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project but, in this snippet, contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
