  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of a comment and a version variable assignment.\n   - There are no data flows, input/output handling, or executable logic.\n   - The code is static and minimal, serving as metadata or documentation.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious code are present.\n   - The reports consistently confirm the benign nature of the snippet.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1), reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n5. **Potential for Changes**:\n   - Since the code is straightforward and the analysis is accurate, there is no need to adjust the scores.\n   - No additional risks or malicious intent are implied or detectable.\n\n6. **Summary & Final Estimation**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n   - **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code snippet is a benign, minimal metadata fragment with no security concerns.\n\n**Final Recommendation**: No changes needed. The overall assessment remains that this code is safe and contains no malicious or obfuscated content.",
