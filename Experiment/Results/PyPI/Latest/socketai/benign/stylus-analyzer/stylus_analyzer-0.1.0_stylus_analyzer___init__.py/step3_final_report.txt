  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for the Stylus Analyzer project, including version information.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; static code with a comment and a variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment without any data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward comment and version variable assignment, no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a descriptive comment and a single variable assignment (__version__ = '0.1.0'). There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, external dependencies, or executable logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is static and serves as metadata, with no potential for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple metadata declaration with no security concerns. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward snippet with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0.",
