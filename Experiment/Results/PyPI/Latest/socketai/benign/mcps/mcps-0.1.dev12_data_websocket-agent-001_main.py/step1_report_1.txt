  "purpose": "A WebSocket test agent for lifecycle testing, providing start, stop, query, and status functions via WebSocket commands.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from 'config.json', incoming WebSocket messages containing commands and queries.",
  "sinks": "Sends responses back through WebSocket connections, writes logs, and loads configuration from file.",
  "flows": "WebSocket message received (source) -> json.loads -> command processed in handler -> response json.dumps -> sent back via WebSocket (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No unusual code constructs. The code performs standard WebSocket server operations and configuration loading.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a WebSocket server that handles lifecycle commands ('start', 'stop', 'query', 'status') by invoking methods on an AgentService instance. The configuration is loaded from an external 'config.json' file, and responses are returned over the WebSocket connection. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be a standard testing agent with no embedded malicious or sabotage features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward WebSocket testing agent with no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected. It performs expected functions in a standard manner without any obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
