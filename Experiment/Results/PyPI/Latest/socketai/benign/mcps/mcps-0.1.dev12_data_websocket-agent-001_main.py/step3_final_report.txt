{
  "purpose": "A WebSocket server designed for lifecycle testing, handling commands such as start, stop, query, and status, primarily for local testing scenarios.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from 'config.json'; processes incoming WebSocket messages containing commands and queries.",
  "sinks": "Processes messages received over WebSocket; responds with JSON-encoded status or command results; no external data sinks or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "WebSocket messages (source) are parsed and trigger internal methods (start, stop, query, status), which generate responses sent back over the WebSocket connection (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution; server runs on localhost, limiting external exposure.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard WebSocket lifecycle testing agent with clear, readable logic. It loads configuration from an external file, handles commands appropriately, and manages client connections without security flaws. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The configuration file could contain sensitive data, but this is a common practice and not inherently malicious. The server operates locally, reducing attack surface. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard patterns justify low security and malware scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It functions as a local testing utility with minimal security risk. The assigned scores in the reports—malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk around 0.1–0.2—are appropriate and justified.",
