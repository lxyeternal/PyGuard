{
  "purpose": "The code implements a WebSocket agent service that handles lifecycle commands (start, stop, status, query) for an agent, primarily for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from 'config.json' file; receives WebSocket messages from clients.",
  "sinks": "Processes incoming WebSocket messages, responds over the same WebSocket connection; uses 'json.loads' on incoming messages.",
  "flows": "WebSocket messages are received from clients (sources) and parsed; commands are processed and responses are sent back over WebSocket.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious domain connections, or malicious code behaviors observed. The code uses standard libraries, with no obfuscated logic, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a WebSocket server that loads configuration from a local JSON file and handles commands like start, stop, status, and query for an agent. It does not include any network connections to external or suspicious domains, nor does it process untrusted data in a harmful manner. All input parsing is straightforward, and responses are safely JSON-encoded. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The only potential concern is that the config file might contain sensitive data, but this is typical and not inherently malicious. The server runs locally on localhost, reducing risk of remote exploitation. Overall, the code appears to be a benign testing utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard WebSocket server intended for lifecycle testing of an agent. No malicious behavior or security risks were identified. It performs typical lifecycle command handling without suspicious features or malicious patterns.",
