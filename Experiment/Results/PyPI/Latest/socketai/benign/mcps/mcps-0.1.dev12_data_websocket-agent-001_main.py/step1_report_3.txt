{
  "purpose": "The code implements a WebSocket server that manages an agent with commands to start, stop, query, and report status, primarily for lifecycle testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from 'config.json'; reads messages from WebSocket clients; reads environment variables if present (not explicitly used here).",
  "sinks": "Processes commands received via WebSocket messages; sends responses back over WebSocket; reads from configuration file.",
  "flows": "WebSocket message received -> JSON parsing -> command dispatch -> response generation -> JSON response sent back.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious external connections; standard WebSocket and JSON handling. No unusual or misleading code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a WebSocket server that handles lifecycle commands for an agent object. It loads configuration from a JSON file, manages client connections, and processes commands like start, stop, query, and status. The command processing and response handling are straightforward, with no code injection, malicious payloads, or data leaks observed. No use of untrusted environment variables, unsafe SQL, or cryptographic weaknesses. The code includes proper resource cleanup. Overall, the implementation appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical WebSocket server for agent lifecycle testing, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as intended without suspicious or malicious features.",
