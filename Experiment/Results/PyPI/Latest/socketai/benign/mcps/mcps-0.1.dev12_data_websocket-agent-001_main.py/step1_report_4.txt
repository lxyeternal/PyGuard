  "purpose": "WebSocket agent for lifecycle testing, managing start/stop, status, and queries.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from 'config.json', receives messages via WebSocket connections.",
  "sinks": "Processes commands and sends responses back through WebSocket; no untrusted data flows into critical system components.",
  "flows": "Input messages from WebSocket clients are parsed and responded to, no dangerous data flows to system or network beyond expected command handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The code handles standard WebSocket server tasks cleanly.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic WebSocket server managing an agent with start, stop, status, and query commands. It loads configuration from 'config.json', uses asyncio and websockets library appropriately, and maintains client sessions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy violations. No dangerous or suspicious code constructs are present. No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data are evident. The flow from input to output is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard WebSocket server implementation for testing purposes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
