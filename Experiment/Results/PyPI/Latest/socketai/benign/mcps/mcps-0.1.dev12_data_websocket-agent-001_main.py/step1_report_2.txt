{
  "purpose": "This code implements a WebSocket-based agent service for lifecycle testing, allowing start, stop, query, and status commands over a WebSocket connection.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from 'config.json' file; receives messages over WebSocket connections.",
  "sinks": "Processes incoming WebSocket messages which can contain commands and queries; outputs responses back over WebSocket.",
  "flows": "Input data from WebSocket messages is parsed and used to invoke methods like start, stop, process_query, or get_status, then responses are sent back through the WebSocket.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of asyncio and websockets appears standard; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an agent class that manages WebSocket connections and processes commands. Configuration is loaded from a local JSON file, which is typical. WebSocket messages are expected to be JSON-formatted commands, and responses are sent accordingly. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors. The code uses standard Python libraries and external websockets module responsibly. No hidden or malicious behaviors identified. The main functions are straightforward and related to lifecycle management. There are no security flaws like unsafe eval, code injection, or hardcoded secrets. The code’s structure and flow are typical for a WebSocket server and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard WebSocket agent for testing purposes, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It operates as intended for a lifecycle test agent, with proper command handling and lifecycle management. No malicious code, data leaks, or backdoors are detected.",
