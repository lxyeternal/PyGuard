{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup file for configuring and installing a Python package named 'mcps'. It uses setuptools to manage package setup, specifically utilizing version control with setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'setuptools' library import and the 'try' block which executes the 'setup' function. It also reads input from the environment via 'pip install' commands in the printed message.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup' function is called with configuration data. The print statement outputs instructions to the user. No untrusted data flows explicitly from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "The setup() function is invoked during execution, potentially using environment or version control data, but no explicit flow from external untrusted sources to critical functions is evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The except block broadly catches exceptions without logging specifics, but this is standard in setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script generated by PyScaffold. It attempts to run the setup() function with a specific version scheme. If an error occurs, it advises updating build tools via a printed message. No external data input, no malicious behavior, and no suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
