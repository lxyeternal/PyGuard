{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'mcps' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it imports setup from setuptools and calls it.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function is called with a configuration; no untrusted data is processed or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; setup() executes with fixed arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a broad except clause without specifying exception types; printing error message and re-raising exception. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script generated by PyScaffold. It calls setup() with a fixed parameter for versioning, and handles exceptions by printing a message. No input validation or untrusted data handling is present. The broad except clause might obscure specific errors but does not constitute malicious behavior. No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The code is straightforward, with minimal risk factors; the broad exception handling is a minor concern but not malicious.",
