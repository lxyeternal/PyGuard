  "purpose": "Standard setup script generated by PyScaffold for packaging a Python project.",
  "sources": "No external input; static call to setup() with version scheme.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; no data leaks or malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "N/A; static execution without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad except clause; no other unusual code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, generated setup script that imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with a version scheme. It handles exceptions broadly, which is common but not ideal. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The minor concern about broad exception handling does not imply malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
