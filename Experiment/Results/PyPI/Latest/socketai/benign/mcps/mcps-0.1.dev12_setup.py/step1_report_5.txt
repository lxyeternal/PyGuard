{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'mcps' Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __main__ module and imports 'setup' from setuptools; it also attempts to run setup() with specific versioning configuration.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function is invoked, which may install or configure package files; the except block prints an error message but does not execute external commands or retrieve untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The script calls setup() with specific parameters; on exception, it prints an error message and re-raises the exception. No external data flows or untrusted inputs are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a broad except clause without specific exception handling; no suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration observed. The code relies on standard packaging tools without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script generated by PyScaffold, intended to configure a Python package. It imports the setup function, calls it with a version scheme, and handles exceptions with a generic print and re-raise. There are no sources of untrusted input, no malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors. The broad exception clause might hide specific errors but does not introduce malicious intent. Overall, the script is a typical setup file for a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup configuration script for a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It uses standard package setup procedures with minimal error handling. No indicators of malware or obfuscation are present.",
