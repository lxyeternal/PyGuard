  "purpose": "Client classes for interacting with MCPS services and agents, handling queries, service calls, and agent sessions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as api_key, query strings, fallback service IDs, and environment data like datetime for session IDs.",
  "sinks": "Network requests via transport.send_request, dynamic session ID generation, and data flow into service and agent response handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> session creation (with datetime timestamp) -> network request via send_request -> response data returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of datetime.now().timestamp() for session IDs, which is predictable but standard; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward client implementation for service and agent interactions, with proper error handling and no suspicious patterns. The use of timestamps for session IDs is common but could be improved for security. No malicious network activity, data leakage, or backdoors are evident. The code's structure and behavior align with benign client-side logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of timestamp-based session IDs is standard and not inherently risky. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero.",
