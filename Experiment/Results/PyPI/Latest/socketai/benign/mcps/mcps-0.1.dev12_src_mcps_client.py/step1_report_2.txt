{
  "purpose": "The code defines client classes for interacting with MCPS services and agents, including querying, calling services, and agent management.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function arguments such as api_key, query, params, service_id, and environment data like datetime.",
  "sinks": "Uses transport.send_request, which may send data over the network; creates session IDs using current timestamp; raises runtime errors.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., API keys, queries, parameters) flow into methods; data is used to construct requests, sessions, and responses, with network calls via transport.send_request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code. The use of datetime.now() for session IDs is not inherently malicious. No unusual or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard client wrappers for service and agent management, with proper error handling. No data leakage, credential theft, or malicious network activity is evident. The use of current timestamps for session IDs is benign. The network requests are abstracted through send_request, which is typical for such clients. No suspicious code structures, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of client classes for service and agent interactions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for such application logic.",
