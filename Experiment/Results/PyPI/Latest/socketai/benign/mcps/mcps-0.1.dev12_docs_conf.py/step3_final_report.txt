  "purpose": "This script configures Sphinx documentation generation, managing paths, extensions, environment variables, and executing sphinx-apidoc to generate API docs. It performs standard build setup tasks without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, imports modules (e.g., mcps), accesses filesystem (shutil.rmtree), constructs and runs external commands (sphinx-apidoc).",
  "sinks": "Filesystem deletion via shutil.rmtree, dynamic import of 'mcps', execution of external command 'sphinx-apidoc'.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and module imports provide configuration data; filesystem operations delete directories; command construction and execution generate documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shutil.rmtree() without explicit validation could be risky; dynamic import of 'mcps' might be a concern if compromised, but is standard for version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration and build script. It manages paths, loads extensions, retrieves version info via dynamic import, cleans output directories, and runs sphinx-apidoc. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. Filesystem operations are controlled and standard for build scripts. The risk scores assigned (around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the context. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard documentation build configuration with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Filesystem operations are typical, and dynamic imports are common for version info. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are justified.",
