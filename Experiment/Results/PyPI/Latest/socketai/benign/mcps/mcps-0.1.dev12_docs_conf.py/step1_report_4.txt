  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation, including setup for automatic API documentation and project metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, filesystem (for paths and files), and imports project modules for version info.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables and filesystem operations; runs external command 'sphinx-apidoc'.",
  "flows": "Imports project module to get version info; deletes output directory; constructs and runs shell command for apidoc.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or malicious behavior detected. Uses standard modules and practices for documentation setup.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily configures Sphinx documentation. It manipulates paths, imports project version info, deletes directories, and runs a documentation generation command. All actions are typical for documentation workflows. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or suspicious command executions are present. The use of environment variables and filesystem operations is standard and safe. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Sphinx documentation configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
