{
  "purpose": "The code provides service management components for the MCPS framework, including discovery, registration, and governance modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from local package modules such as .discovery.base, .discovery.registry_based, .registry.base, .registry.memory, and .governance.base.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing present that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and functions from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, with no dynamic execution or data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated elements are present. The code is straightforward and mainly defines module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and an __all__ declaration, serving as an interface for the module's components. There are no input handling, data processing, or external network interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, suspicious logic, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The structure is standard for a package's __init__.py or module export file.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple module aggregator, exposing various service management classes and functions. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and safe.",
