{
  "purpose": "This module provides service discovery, registration, and governance components for managing distributed services in the MCPS framework.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes and functions from local modules within the package, such as .discovery.base, .discovery.registry_based, .registry.base, .registry.memory, and .governance.base.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that handle untrusted data, user input, or external outputs in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports components from various modules and then exposes them via __all__, creating an interface for external use. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; it primarily sets up package exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, mainly importing and exporting modules. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module that imports several classes related to service discovery, registry, and governance, then exposes them via the __all__ list for external access. The imports are from local modules within the package, indicating standard package structure. No suspicious logic, external data handling, or potentially malicious behavior is present. The code appears to serve as an organizational or interface layer without any embedded security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with imports and exports for a service management framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a clean, well-structured package component.",
