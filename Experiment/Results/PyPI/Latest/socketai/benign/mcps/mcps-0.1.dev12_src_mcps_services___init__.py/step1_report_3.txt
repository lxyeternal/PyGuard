{
  "purpose": "Provides service management components such as discovery, registration, and governance for MCPS framework",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the package: .discovery.base, .discovery.registry_based, .registry.base, .registry.memory, .governance.base",
  "sinks": "No evident sink that processes untrusted external input or data; mainly imports and exposes internal classes",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines __all__ for module exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code strictly defines imports and exports, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports several classes from submodules related to service discovery, registry, and governance. It then exposes these classes via __all__ for external use. No input handling, no data processing, no suspicious behavior. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or module interface definition. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module that organizes and exposes service management classes. There are no indicators of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this snippet.",
