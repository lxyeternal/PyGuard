{
  "purpose": "Provides service discovery, registration, and governance components for MCPS framework.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes from local submodules related to discovery, registry, and governance.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no handling of untrusted data or user input observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, mainly imports and exports, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes from local modules and defines an __all__ list for module exports. There are no suspicious patterns, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated segments. The module functions as a structured interface for service management components. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a clean, standard module interface with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a benign component that re-exports classes for use elsewhere.",
