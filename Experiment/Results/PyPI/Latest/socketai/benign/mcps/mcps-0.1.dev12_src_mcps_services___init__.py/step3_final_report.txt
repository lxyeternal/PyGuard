{
  "purpose": "This module provides service discovery, registration, and governance components for the MCPS framework, acting as an index of imported classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local submodules (.discovery.base, .discovery.registry_based, .registry.base, .registry.memory, .governance.base)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external input, network, or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Import statements load classes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic execution, network calls, or data handling. The structure is typical for a package index or __init__.py file. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface without any malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, though the minimal security risk score could be lowered to zero given the lack of vulnerabilities.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
