{
  "purpose": "This module provides service discovery, registration, and governance capabilities for managing distributed services in the MCPS framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local package modules (.discovery.base, .discovery.registry_based, .registry.base, .registry.memory, .governance.base).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or eval/exec functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly imports classes and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. All code appears standard and clean.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local package modules and an __all__ definition. There are no dynamic executions, network operations, or data handling that could introduce security risks. The comments describe the module purpose but do not influence code behavior. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module index file that imports various service management components and exposes them via __all__. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious code, or security concerns present in this fragment.",
