  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains only comments and a version variable with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely documentation with a comment and a version string. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign intent. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, aligning with the code's nature. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are present. The high confidence score reflects certainty in this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, non-executable documentation snippet with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are justified and accurate.",
