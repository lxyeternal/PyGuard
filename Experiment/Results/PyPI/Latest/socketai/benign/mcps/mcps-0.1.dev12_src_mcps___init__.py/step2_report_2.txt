  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code snippet:**\n- The code is only a comment block and a version string.\n- No functions, methods, data processing, or executable logic.\n- No external dependencies, network calls, or dynamic behavior.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as purely documentation with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Comments:** The assessment aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the lack of executable logic or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Comments:** Accurate; no concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is just documentation and version info.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Comments:** Consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; purely descriptive comments and version.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Comments:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Also concludes the code is only metadata/documentation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Comments:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code contains no executable logic, data flows, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the content.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Zero, since there's no security concern.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet. No changes needed.\n- The reports are thorough and cautious, correctly noting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk in this documentation snippet)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nGiven the content, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is purely documentation with no executable or malicious elements. The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet. No further action or concern is necessary.",
