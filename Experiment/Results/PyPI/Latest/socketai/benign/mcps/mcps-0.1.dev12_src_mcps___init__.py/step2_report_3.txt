  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely a documentation snippet with no executable logic.\n- No sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are detected.\n- All scores for obfuscated, malware, and security risk are zero, which aligns with the code content.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - Confirms the code is a benign documentation snippet.\n   - Scores: obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n   - Justification: No executable code, no suspicious activity.\n   \n2. **Report 2**\n   - Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the lack of malicious or suspicious features.\n   - Scores are consistent.\n   \n3. **Report 3**\n   - Same conclusion, consistent with previous reports.\n   \n4. **Report 4**\n   - Reiterates that the code is only descriptive comments and version info.\n   - Scores align well.\n   \n5. **Report 5**\n   - Same as above, no issues detected.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- All reports are consistent; none identify any actual code behavior that could be malicious or obfuscated.\n- The scores assigned (all zeros for malware, obfuscated, and security risk) are appropriate given the content.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is purely documentation with no executable or suspicious elements.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Note:** Since all reports agree and the code is trivial, my estimates align with theirs. No further action is necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign documentation with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent across all reports.",
