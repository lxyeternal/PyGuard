  "purpose": "Implementation of a service discoverer that uses a service registry to find services based on natural language queries or metadata filters.",
  "sources": "Inputs are 'query' (str), 'filters' (dict), and 'service_id' (str); data is read from the 'registry' object via methods 'search', 'list_services', and 'get'.",
  "sinks": "Conversion of registry data into ServiceDescriptor objects; no external data output or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into registry methods, then from registry results into descriptors via '_registration_to_descriptor' method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code mostly calls external registry methods and transforms data. No signs of malicious code or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for service discovery based on a provided registry object. It uses well-defined methods to query, filter, and retrieve service information. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The logic is straightforward and relies on the 'registry' interface, which is standard in such design. No suspicious input handling or insecure patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a service discoverer that interacts with a service registry. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are detected based on this snippet.",
