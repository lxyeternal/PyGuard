{
  "purpose": "Implement a service discoverer that interacts with a service registry to find and retrieve service descriptors based on queries and filters.",
  "sources": "registry.search(), registry.list_services(), registry.get()",
  "sinks": "None evident; data from registry is processed but not directly outputted or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from registry methods (search, list_services, get) into conversion functions to produce ServiceDescriptor objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for discovering services via a registry interface, converting registry data into descriptors. It uses standard method calls, processes inputs, and returns structured data without executing or transmitting untrusted data beyond internal processing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a service discovery class relying on external registry methods. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code segment.",
