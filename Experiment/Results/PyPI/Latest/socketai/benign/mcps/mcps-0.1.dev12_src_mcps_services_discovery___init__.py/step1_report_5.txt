{
  "purpose": "Provides service discovery components for the MCPS framework, including class imports and module documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base and .registry_based). No external input sources or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that process untrusted data; the code primarily defines module exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and typical for a module interface.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that documents its purpose, imports classes from sibling modules, and defines __all__ for export. It does not perform any data processing, I/O, network communication, or contain logic that could be malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard component of a larger framework, solely responsible for defining and exporting service discovery classes. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
