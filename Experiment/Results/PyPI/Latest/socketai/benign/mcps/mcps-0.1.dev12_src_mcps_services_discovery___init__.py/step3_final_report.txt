  "purpose": "Provides service discovery mechanisms for locating and connecting to services within the MCPS framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.base and .registry_based).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "None; no data flows from sources to sinks as the code only imports and exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward module with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports specific classes and exposes them via __all__. It contains only import statements and a docstring, with no runtime logic, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface module with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The assessments and scores across all reports are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
