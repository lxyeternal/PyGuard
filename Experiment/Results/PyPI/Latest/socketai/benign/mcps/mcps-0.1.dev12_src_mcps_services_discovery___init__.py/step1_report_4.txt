{
  "purpose": "Provides service discovery components for the MCPS framework, including class imports and module documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .registry_based). No external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing, no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow between sources and sinks; code only imports and defines module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious patterns. The module is straightforward, primarily import statements and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that documents its purpose and imports specific classes from local modules. It then defines the public API via __all__. There are no code execution, input handling, or data processing routines present. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The structure and content are typical of a clean, well-structured Python package component.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign part of a larger package, serving as an API module to expose specific components. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on this fragment.",
