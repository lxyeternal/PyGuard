{
  "purpose": "Provides service discovery components for the MCPS framework, including class imports and module metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base and .registry_based) and the __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from local modules related to service discovery, then defines an export list. It serves as an interface or component registration module with no runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present. The module is straightforward and appears to be part of a larger, legitimate framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module initialization with import and export statements for service discovery components. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
