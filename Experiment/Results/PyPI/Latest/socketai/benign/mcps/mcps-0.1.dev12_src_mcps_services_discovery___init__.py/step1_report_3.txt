{
  "purpose": "Provides service discovery components for the MCPS framework, including class imports and module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.base and .registry_based).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; only module imports and exports are present.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. No malicious or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module that imports classes related to service discovery and exposes them via __all__. It does not process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or include any suspicious patterns. The structure is typical for a Python package's init file, serving as an API surface for other modules.\n\nNo signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security risks are evident. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest it's a standard component without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, benign part of the package's API, with no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
