  "purpose": "Provides service discovery components for the MCPS framework, including imports and module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.base and .registry_based).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing present that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources; the code only imports and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific classes and exports them via __all__. No input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior. The module serves as an interface for other components, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module for defining and exporting service discovery classes. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and poses no security risks.",
