{
  "purpose": "A simple Fibonacci calculator with CLI and library support, intended as a template or educational example.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument 'n' via argparse, standard input validation with 'assert n > 0'.",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout via print; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input 'n' flows into 'fib' function, which computes Fibonacci number, then output is printed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert n > 0' which can be bypassed with Python optimizations; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, using standard libraries, with no obfuscation, network calls, or malicious patterns. The 'assert' statement is a minor concern but not a security vulnerability. No suspicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0-0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured Fibonacci calculator template with no malicious intent or security risks. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) is justified due to the 'assert' statement, but overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
