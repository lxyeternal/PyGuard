{
  "purpose": "Provide a command-line interface and library functions for calculating Fibonacci numbers.",
  "sources": "Input is read from command line arguments (args parameter in main), specifically the integer 'n' for Fibonacci calculation.",
  "sinks": "The code prints output to stdout; no direct data leaks. No untrusted data is sent over the network or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input 'n' from command line -> parse_args -> main -> fib(n) -> print result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of logging, argparse, and simple Fibonacci logic are standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward Fibonacci calculator with CLI and library interfaces. It imports standard libraries, defines a simple Fibonacci function, and uses argparse for input parsing. The logging setup is typical, and the main function outputs results directly to stdout. No malicious behavior, suspicious network activity, or security risks are evident. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, educational example of a Python CLI and library module for Fibonacci numbers. There are no signs of malware, malicious data flows, or security vulnerabilities. It is a safe and typical implementation.",
