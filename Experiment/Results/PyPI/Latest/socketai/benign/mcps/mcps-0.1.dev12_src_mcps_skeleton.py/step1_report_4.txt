{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a template for a Python command-line tool that calculates Fibonacci numbers.",
  "sources": "Input is read from command-line arguments (n), and configuration is done via imports and setup functions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the result to stdout; no untrusted data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "User inputs n via command-line, which is processed by fib(n) and printed to stdout; no external network or data leaks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code are present. The code performs straightforward calculations and logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Fibonacci calculator with CLI interface. It imports standard libraries, sets up logging, and performs input validation via assert. No external network access, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is clean, modular, and uses common practices. There are no suspicious or malicious signals detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, boilerplate Fibonacci CLI tool with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs its intended function securely and transparently.",
