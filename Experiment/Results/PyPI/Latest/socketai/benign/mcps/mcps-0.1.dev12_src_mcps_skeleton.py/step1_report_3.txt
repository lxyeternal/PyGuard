{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface to compute Fibonacci numbers, intended as a demonstration or template for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Input source is the command line argument 'n' (parsed via argparse). No other data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the output of the Fibonacci number printed to stdout. No untrusted data is written to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input 'n' flows from command line argument through parse_args, into main, which calls fib, and then outputs the result to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or backdoors. No dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple Fibonacci function, a CLI parser, and logging setup. It securely handles input validation via 'assert' and type checking in argparse. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious patterns are present. The script is straightforward, and all data flows are contained within expected boundaries. No external or suspicious libraries are invoked beyond standard Python modules. No anomalies or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, straightforward Fibonacci calculator intended as a template or demonstration. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is simple and secure, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
