{
  "purpose": "This code provides a skeleton implementation for a Python CLI tool that calculates Fibonacci numbers, serving as a template or starting point for similar projects.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via command-line arguments parsed by argparse (the number n), and potentially from environment variables or external sources if extended, but none are explicitly used here.",
  "sinks": "Output is sent to stdout via print and logging functions. No untrusted data is sent to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "User provides input n via CLI → parse_args() processes input → main() calls fib(n) → result is printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code strictly adheres to a template for Fibonacci calculation and CLI setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a command-line Fibonacci calculator, with proper argument parsing, logging setup, and main execution guard. No external data sources, no data leaks, no suspicious or malicious behaviors are present. The use of assertions and standard library functions suggests a safe design focused on utility rather than security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard template for a CLI application. It performs no malicious actions, contains no malware, and does not exhibit any security risks. It is a clean, conventional implementation for a Fibonacci calculator template.",
