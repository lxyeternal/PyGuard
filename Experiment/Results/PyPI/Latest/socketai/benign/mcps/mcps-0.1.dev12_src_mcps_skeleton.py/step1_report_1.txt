{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a template for a Python command-line utility that computes Fibonacci numbers and provides a skeleton for further development of Python modules with CLI support.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from command line arguments (via sys.argv) and environment variables (implicitly through logging configuration).",
  "sinks": "Outputs are written to stdout via print and logging messages; no untrusted data is written to files or network. No external system modifications or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "User inputs a number n through command line arguments; this flows into the fib() function which computes the Fibonacci number; results are printed to stdout. Logging may record flow but does not leak data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard libraries without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple Fibonacci calculator with CLI and library support. It uses argparse for input, logging for messages, and a basic Fibonacci implementation. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. All functions and modules serve benign purposes. The code includes comments and standard practices, with no suspicious or obfuscated segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template for a CLI-based Fibonacci calculator and library module. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It appears to be a safe, well-structured sample script.",
