{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes and data structures for service discovery mechanisms",
  "sources": "No data input sources; code defines classes and method signatures",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs, no untrusted data handling or external connections",
  "flows": "Method signatures indicate data flow within expected operations, no external data flow or execution paths",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code provides class and method definitions for service discovery, including data class for metadata. All methods are abstract, serving as interfaces. No actual implementation, network calls, or data processing logic present. No signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard abstract interface for service discovery with no malicious or security-risk elements. It simply defines expected structure and method signatures, lacking executable or suspicious code.",
