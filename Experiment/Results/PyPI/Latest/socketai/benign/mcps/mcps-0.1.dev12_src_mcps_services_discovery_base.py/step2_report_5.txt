  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports confirm that the code is purely structural, consisting of abstract classes and data classes with no executable logic.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or data leaks are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code serves as an interface or framework for service discovery, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Specific observations:**\n- The code is consistent across reports, with no contradictions.\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct given the straightforward, readable code.\n- The security risk score is 0, as the code contains no vulnerabilities or risky constructs.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since all reports agree that the code is purely structural, there is no evidence of malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) seem appropriate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious activity are justified based solely on this code.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, clean interface definition.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n- The scores provided are reasonable and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- Maintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- No further action needed unless additional context or code is provided.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided reports and code analysis, I agree with the assessments. The code is safe, non-malicious, and purely structural, with no security risks.",
