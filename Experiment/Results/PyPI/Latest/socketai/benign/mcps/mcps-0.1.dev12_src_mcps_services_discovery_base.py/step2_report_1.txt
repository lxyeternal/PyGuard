  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code consists solely of data class and abstract class definitions.\n   - There are no executable implementations, data flows, or external data handling.\n   - No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that this code is purely structural and interface-defining.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident, as the code is not operational.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree that the code is purely structural with no runtime or malicious behavior, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would imply potential security concerns, which are not supported by the analysis.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - No malicious activity is indicated.\n   - The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or contain obfuscated/malicious payloads.\n   - Malware score should stay at 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and based on static code analysis, not assumptions.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of suspicious constructs.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores align well with the detailed analysis.\n   - No inconsistencies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward, non-malicious interface definition for a service discovery framework. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n**Note:** If future implementations of these interfaces are added, security considerations should include validation, input sanitization, and secure handling of data, but as-is, the code poses no security threat.",
