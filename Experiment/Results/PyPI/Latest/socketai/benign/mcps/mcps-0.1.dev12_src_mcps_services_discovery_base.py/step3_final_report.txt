{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface and data structure for service discovery mechanisms, including methods for NLP-based search, metadata filtering, and service retrieval.",
  "sources": "No runtime data input; static class and method definitions only.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; method signatures indicate intended data interactions but contain no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises a data class 'ServiceDescriptor' and an abstract base class 'ServiceDiscoverer' with three abstract methods. It is purely structural, serving as an interface for future implementations. No executable logic, data flows, or external interactions are present. The code does not contain any signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purely structural interface definition for a service discovery framework. It poses no security threat, contains no malware or obfuscation, and the current scores accurately reflect its safe, non-malicious status.",
