  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes and data structures for service discovery functionality",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read directly in this code; it primarily defines classes and methods",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; the code only defines interfaces and a data class",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or untrusted data processing within this code segment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward and declarative",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class ServiceDescriptor and an abstract class ServiceDiscoverer with abstract methods for service lookup operations. It does not contain any executable logic, external data reads, or potential data leaks. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. It appears to be a clean, interface-defining module with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious interface definition for service discovery. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities. It is purely declarative and does not process or transmit data.",
