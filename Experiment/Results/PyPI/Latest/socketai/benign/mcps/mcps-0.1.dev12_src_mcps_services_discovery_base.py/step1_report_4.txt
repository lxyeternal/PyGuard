{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes and data structures for a service discovery system",
  "sources": "No input sources or external data reads are present in the code",
  "sinks": "No data outputs, external calls, or untrusted data handling are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists within this code",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected. The code strictly defines classes and dataclasses with no executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass for service metadata and an abstract base class for service discovery. It includes method signatures with docstrings but no implementation details or data manipulation logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a straightforward, structural code segment intended for extension.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, structural setup for service discovery with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious behaviors, no external data operations, and no obfuscation.",
