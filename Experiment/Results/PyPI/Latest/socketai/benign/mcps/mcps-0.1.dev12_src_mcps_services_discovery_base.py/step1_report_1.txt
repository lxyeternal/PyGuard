{
  "purpose": "Define abstract classes and data structure for service discovery mechanisms",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code defines classes and method signatures only",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; methods are abstract and unimplemented",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this code as all methods are abstract placeholders",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed; code is standard class and data structure definitions",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a framework for service discovery with an abstract base class and a data class for service metadata. There are no executable data flows, input/output handling, or suspicious logic. All methods are abstract, serving as interface definitions, which do not pose security risks. No malicious or maliciously intended code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard abstract class and data structure definitions for service discovery; no malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
