{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes and data structures for service discovery mechanisms",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code defines data structures and abstract methods without runtime input handling",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; no untrusted data handling or external connections",
  "flows": "No data flow execution; purely interface and data class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard use of abstract classes and dataclasses",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of data class definitions and abstract base classes for service discovery. There are no data input, external network connections, or runtime code execution present. All methods are abstract, with no implementations that could execute malicious actions. The code appears to serve as a framework or interface for further implementation. No signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard interface definition for a service discovery system, with no malicious intent or security risks present. It does not contain any active or harmful code. The overall security risk is minimal.",
