{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point that imports a 'server' module, sets a version, and exposes a main function that calls server.main().",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from . import server', and access to server.main() function",
  "sinks": "Calling server.main() could be a sink if server.main() executes untrusted code or network operations, but this code only calls the imported function",
  "flows": "Imports module 'server' -> calls server.main() when main() is invoked",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code; no obfuscated code or malicious patterns identified",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, acting as a module interface that delegates execution to server.main(). There are no data inputs, no handling of untrusted data, and no suspicious behaviors. The import is relative, which is standard in package modules. No evidence of malicious intent or security risks is present within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module interface without malicious behavior or security risks. It simply delegates execution to the 'server' module's main() function. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
