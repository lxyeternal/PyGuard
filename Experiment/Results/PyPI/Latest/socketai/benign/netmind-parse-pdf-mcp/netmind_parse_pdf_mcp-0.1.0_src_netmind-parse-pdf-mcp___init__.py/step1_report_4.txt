{
  "purpose": "This code acts as an entry point that imports and exposes functionalities from a local 'server' module and defines a main function that calls server.main().",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from . import server' and usage of 'server.main()' within the main() function.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of 'server.main()', which could potentially execute code from the 'server' module that might contain malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'server' from the local package, then the main() function calls 'server.main()'. The flow depends entirely on the implementation of 'server.main()' which is not provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code appears straightforward and typical for a module's entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal interface for a package, importing a 'server' module and providing a main() function that delegates execution to 'server.main()'. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or embedded malicious actions visible. The potential risk depends on the content of the 'server' module's main() function, which is not included. Without additional context, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple entry point, delegating execution to 'server.main()'. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks within this fragment itself, assuming the 'server' module is safe.",
