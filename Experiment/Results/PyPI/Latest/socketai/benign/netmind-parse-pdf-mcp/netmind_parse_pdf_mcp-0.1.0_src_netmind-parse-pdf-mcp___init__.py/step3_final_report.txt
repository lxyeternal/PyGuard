  "purpose": "A minimal entry point module that imports a local server module and delegates execution to server.main()",
  "sources": "Importing the local module 'server'",
  "sinks": "Calling server.main()",
  "flows": "From main() function to server.main()",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward delegation without suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module, defines a version string, and provides a main() function that calls server.main(). It exposes main and server via __all__. No external input handling, data processing, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The only sink is server.main(), which depends on the implementation of the server module. The code is clear, simple, and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the external server module, which is not provided. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero; the security risk score is low (0.1) to acknowledge external dependency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module entry point with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal and hinges on the implementation of server.main(), which is outside the scope of this code snippet. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
