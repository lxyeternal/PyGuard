{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point that imports a server module, defines a version, and provides a main function to run the server's main process.",
  "sources": "The code reads the server module (imported as .), and the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling; the code simply calls server.main() without processing external input.",
  "flows": "The main function calls server.main(), but there is no data flow involving external input or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and function call structure, no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local server module, defines a version string, and provides a main function that invokes server.main(). The __all__ variable indicates public API exposure. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be a simple application entry point with standard structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It functions as an entry point to invoke server logic. No suspicious elements or risks are identified.",
