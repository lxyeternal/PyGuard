{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for a package, importing a 'server' module and exposing a main() function.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a local module and defines a function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The main() function calls server.main(), which could potentially contain untrusted data handling, but that is outside this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not include any suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module 'server' and defines a main() function that calls server.main(). It explicitly sets the __all__ attribute for module exports. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module entry point with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger project, delegating execution to server.main().",
