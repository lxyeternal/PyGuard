  "purpose": "Initialize server parameters, establish an async client session over stdio, and retrieve a list of tools to output as JSON.",

  "sinks": "Printing tools JSON to stdout",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'NETMIND_API_TOKE' (read at startup) -> session initialization -> session.list_tools() -> print JSON output",
  "anomalies": "Typo in environment variable name ('NETMIND_API_TOKE'), placeholder value 'GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY' used as API token",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, setting up server parameters with a likely typo in the environment variable name and a placeholder API key. It establishes an async stdio client session, calls list_tools(), and prints the result. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The typo and placeholder suggest misconfiguration rather than malicious intent. All reports correctly identify these issues, with malware scores at 0 and low risk scores (around 0.2). The main concern is operational, not security. The code is benign, and the potential misconfiguration should be corrected but does not constitute a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with a minor typo and placeholder environment variable value. No malware or malicious activity is detected. The overall security risk is low, primarily due to misconfiguration, not malicious intent.",
