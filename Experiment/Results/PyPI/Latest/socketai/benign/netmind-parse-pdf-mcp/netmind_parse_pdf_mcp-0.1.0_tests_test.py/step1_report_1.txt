{
  "purpose": "The code initializes an MCP client session over standard I/O, requests a list of tools, and outputs the tools in JSON format.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('NETMIND_API_TOKE') and data from the response of 'session.list_tools()'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON data to the console via 'print'. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variable 'NETMIND_API_TOKE' -> Calls 'session.list_tools()' -> Prints the tools data.",
  "anomalies": "The environment variable 'NETMIND_API_TOKE' appears to be a placeholder or misconfigured, not a real token; no sensitive data is hardcoded; the variable name is misspelled ('TOKE' instead of 'TOKEN'). No suspicious or malicious code is evident. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a server configuration with a command and environment variable, then establishes an asynchronous client session over stdio. It requests a list of tools via the session, processes the response into a list of dictionaries, and prints the result. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The environment variable appears to be a placeholder, and no untrusted input processing is present. No signs of malware, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply initializes a client, retrieves data, and outputs it. The environment variable is likely a placeholder or misconfigured, but does not pose security concerns.",
