  "purpose": "A simple test function to verify the addition operation.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code uses only hardcoded literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function performs a basic assertion.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward test function.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'test_addition' that asserts 1 + 1 equals 2. There are no input reading, no external data handling, no network operations, and no suspicious or malicious code constructs. It appears to be a standard unit test snippet commonly used in Python testing frameworks. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, simple test function with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
