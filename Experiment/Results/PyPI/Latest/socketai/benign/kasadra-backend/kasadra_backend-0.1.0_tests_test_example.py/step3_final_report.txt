  "purpose": "A simple unit test verifying that 1 + 1 equals 2, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or data reads; static code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks, network activity, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assertion without data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, clear, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static test function asserting 1 + 1 == 2. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behaviors are present. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the code's clarity and lack of complexity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no security risks or malicious activity. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
