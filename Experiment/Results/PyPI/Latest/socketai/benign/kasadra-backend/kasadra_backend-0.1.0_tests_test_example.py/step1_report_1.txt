{
  "purpose": "The function is a simple test to verify that 1 + 1 equals 2, likely for unit testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; static code with no external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output that could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code only performs an assertion on a static expression.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward and minimal code with no signs of suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single test function that asserts a basic arithmetic statement. It does not read any external data, execute any dynamic code, or perform any network or system operations. The purpose appears to be a simple unit test or a placeholder. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward unit test snippet.",
