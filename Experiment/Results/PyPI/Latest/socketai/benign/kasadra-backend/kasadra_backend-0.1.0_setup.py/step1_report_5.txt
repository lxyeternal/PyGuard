{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'kasadra-backend' Python package, including its name, version, packages, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, and dependencies defined within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or inputs are present. The code does not process external or user-provided data.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code is static configuration without data flows or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard setup script with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated elements, or suspicious logic. The dependencies list is empty, which is normal for a minimal setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with static metadata. There are no input sources, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, nor network interactions. The dependencies list is empty, indicating no additional packages are being installed. The code follows typical Python packaging conventions and does not contain any malicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a benign and standard configuration file for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
