  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'kasadra-backend'.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dependencies; no suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions from setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies package name, version, and utilizes find_packages() to include sub-packages. The install_requires list is empty, indicating no additional dependencies are specified. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious constructs. The script is standard for Python package setup files and does not perform any runtime operations beyond package metadata declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
