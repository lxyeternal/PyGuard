  "sources": "Imports from setuptools to set up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; this is a standard setup script.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools to configure packaging details such as name, version, and packages. The 'install_requires' list is empty, indicating no dependencies are specified. The script is straightforward and typical for Python package setup. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or other risky behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a standard package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
