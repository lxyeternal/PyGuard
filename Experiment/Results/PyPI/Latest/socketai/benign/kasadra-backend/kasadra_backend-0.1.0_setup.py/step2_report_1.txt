  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard setup.py script for a Python package named 'kasadra-backend'.\n- The code is minimal, static, and uses typical setuptools functions.\n- No dependencies are specified, and there are no indications of input handling, external network communication, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious or malicious code elements, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description in all reports.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities based on the provided information.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The malware score is 0 because there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 because the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score is 0 because the code does not introduce any vulnerabilities or insecure practices.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is benign, which aligns with the code's content.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made beyond the code analysis, which is appropriate.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, minimal setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. It serves its purpose of defining package metadata and dependencies safely.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary based on the provided code and reports.",
