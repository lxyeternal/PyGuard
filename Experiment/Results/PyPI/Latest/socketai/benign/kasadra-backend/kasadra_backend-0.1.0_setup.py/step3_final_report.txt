  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the 'kasadra-backend' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static code with package name, version, and package discovery via find_packages(). No input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, minimal, and standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static setup.py script importing setuptools functions, defining package name, version, and packages with no dependencies. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or obfuscated elements. The code aligns with typical packaging scripts and shows no signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate; no further action or concerns are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
