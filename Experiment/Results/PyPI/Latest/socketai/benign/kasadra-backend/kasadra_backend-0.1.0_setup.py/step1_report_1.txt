{
  "purpose": "The code is used to configure the packaging and installation of a Python project named 'kasadra-backend'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies and configuration data via the 'setup' function and 'find_packages()'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or external outputs in this script.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to package metadata and dependency listing, with no data flows leading to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for a setup script. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The install_requires list is empty, indicating no dependencies are specified.",
  "analysis": "This setup script is a typical configuration file for packaging a Python project using setuptools. It imports necessary functions, defines package metadata, and specifies dependencies (which are currently empty). The code does not contain any input handling, external network communication, or executable logic that could be malicious. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It serves its purpose of defining package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious elements.",
