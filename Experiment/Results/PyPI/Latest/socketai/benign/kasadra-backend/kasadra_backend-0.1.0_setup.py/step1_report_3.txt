  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'kasadra-backend' Python project, specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration and dependencies from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or untrusted output; no network, file, or system modification operations present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sensitive data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The comments indicate placeholder for dependencies but do not include any malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It includes an import statement, a setup() call with basic package info, and a commented section for dependencies. No code execution, data input, or network operations are present. The structure and content align with typical Python package setup files, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign, standard setup configuration for a Python package with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
