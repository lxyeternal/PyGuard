{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up and run a test for the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) from the EvoloPy package, including configuring the environment and defining test cases.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem to determine the EvoloPy directory path; it also accepts input through function parameters for objective functions and bounds.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data or handle sensitive data. It calls the WOA optimizer with a provided objective function, but the function itself is defined within the code.",
  "flows": "The source of data (filesystem path, input parameters) flows into the setup of the optimizer; the optimizer's output (best individual, convergence curve, best score) is used for assertions in the test.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears straightforward and consistent with standard testing procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, dynamically adjusts the Python path to include a specific directory, and defines test fixtures and a test function. It does not contain any code that interacts with external systems beyond filesystem path operations or performs network activity. The objective function and WOA usage are standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code execution. The assertions are typical for test validation, and no secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are present. The code structure and flow are typical for Python testing modules, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing script for a scientific computing package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe, with normal usage of imports, fixtures, and assertions.",
