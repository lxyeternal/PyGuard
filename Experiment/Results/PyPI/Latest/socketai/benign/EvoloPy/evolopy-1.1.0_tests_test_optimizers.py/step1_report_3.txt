{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the functionality of optimization algorithms (PSO, GWO, MVO) on benchmark functions to ensure they return valid solutions and properties.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'unittest', 'numpy', and 'EvoloPy' modules; uses benchmark functions F1, F2, F3; calls optimization functions PSO.PSO, GWO.GWO, MVO.MVO.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output, network communication, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke optimization methods with benchmark functions and parameters; results are validated through assertions; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code is standard for a unit testing module.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard testing and numerical libraries along with the 'EvoloPy' optimization package and benchmark functions. It defines a unittest.TestCase class that performs multiple tests to verify the correctness of optimization algorithms by checking properties of returned results. The tests focus on result structure, solution bounds, and compatibility with various benchmarks. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity appears present. The code is straightforward, structured for testing, and contains no suspicious patterns or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate unit testing script for optimization algorithms with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It contains no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious data handling, and functions as expected for a test suite.",
