{
  "purpose": "Unit testing of optimization algorithms (PSO, GWO, MVO) to verify their output validity and correctness with benchmark functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'unittest', 'numpy', and 'EvoloPy' modules; function calls to optimization algorithms; attribute access on result objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted external data; no data being written to external locations or network activities.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected; the code only performs function calls and attribute checks on objects returned by those functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite designed to verify the correctness of optimization algorithms. It imports testing frameworks, optimization algorithms, and benchmark functions. Each test calls the algorithms with predefined parameters and performs assertions on the returned result objects. There are no external data inputs, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors. All operations appear typical for a testing script, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for optimization algorithms with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe and does not contain malware. The purpose is validation, not exploitation or data theft.",
