  "purpose": "Unit testing framework for optimization algorithms (PSO, GWO, MVO) using benchmark functions F1, F2, F3",
  "sources": "Import statements for unittest, numpy, and functions from EvoloPy package",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or output sinks involved in the test code",
  "flows": "N/A; the code mainly calls functions and performs assertions without data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard unit testing code with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of unit tests for optimization algorithms from a library, testing the validity and bounds of solutions. It imports necessary modules, sets up common parameters, and verifies that returned results contain expected properties, such as bestIndividual, convergence, and correct labels. The tests also confirm solutions are within bounds and that different benchmarks are handled correctly. No code executes external commands, network operations, or manipulates environment variables. The code does not include any obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward set of unit tests for optimization algorithms with no malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks detected.",
