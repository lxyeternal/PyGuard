{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for evolutionary optimizer functions (PSO, GWO, MVO) from the EvoloPy library, validating output structure and solution bounds.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (unittest, numpy) and from the EvoloPy package (optimizers and benchmarks).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external system calls; test assertions validate object properties and bounds.",
  "flows": "Test functions call optimizer methods with benchmark functions, then verify the properties of returned result objects, including 'bestIndividual', 'convergence', 'optimizer', and 'objfname'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no unusual patterns. The code primarily performs standard unit testing procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard testing and numerical libraries, then defines a test class with setup parameters and multiple test methods. Each test method invokes optimizer functions with fixed input parameters and verifies the structure and content of returned result objects. No external network or file I/O, no eval or exec statements, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be straightforward unit testing code without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical unit testing script for optimization algorithms with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs expected validation tasks without suspicious or harmful operations.",
