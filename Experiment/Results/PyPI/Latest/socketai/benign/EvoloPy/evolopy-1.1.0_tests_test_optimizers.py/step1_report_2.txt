{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the EvoloPy optimization algorithms (PSO, GWO, MVO) using benchmark functions F1, F2, F3",
  "sources": "Import statements for unittest, numpy, and EvoloPy modules; test methods invoking optimizer functions with benchmark functions",
  "sinks": "Assertions on result object properties and value ranges, no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily calls to imported functions and assertions on returned objects",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing of optimization algorithms, verifying properties of returned results such as solution bounds and object attributes. It imports established libraries and calls functions from the EvoloPy package with predefined parameters. No external network access, file operations, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of testing algorithm correctness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit testing script with no malicious intent, malware, or security risks identified. It is safe and aligns with typical testing practices for scientific computing code.",
