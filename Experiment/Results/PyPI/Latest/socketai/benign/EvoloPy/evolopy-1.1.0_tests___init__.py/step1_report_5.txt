  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard test documentation",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a comment indicating it is for unit tests of the EvoloPy package. No executable code, input reading, data processing, or data sinks are present. Without actual test code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated logic, or security issues. The comment suggests standard testing practices but does not provide any suspicious code or activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided snippet is a simple comment describing unit tests for a package. It contains no executable code or data handling that could be malicious. Based on this limited fragment, there is no indication of malware or security risks.",
