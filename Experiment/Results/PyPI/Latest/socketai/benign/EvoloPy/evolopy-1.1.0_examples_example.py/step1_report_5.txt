  "purpose": "The code is designed to run optimization algorithms from the EvoloPy library on specified benchmark functions with certain parameters and export the results in various formats.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.join, os.path.dirname, sys.path.append, from EvoloPy.optimizer import run, variables optimizer, objectivefunc, NumOfRuns, params, export_flags",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling, no network or system command execution, no sensitive data processing",
  "flows": "The code constructs a path, modifies sys.path, imports a function, sets parameters, and executes run(optimizer, objectivefunc, ...)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup and invocation of a known library function, no obfuscated or suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The script initializes by setting up the environment path and imports a run function from a local library. It then defines parameters for optimization algorithms and their settings. The run function is called with these parameters. All code appears to be standard and intended for executing optimization routines without any suspicious operations or malicious code execution. There are no hardcoded secrets, no network operations, and no code that manipulates or exfiltrates data.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate setup for running optimization algorithms with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It primarily interacts with local modules and performs typical computations.",
