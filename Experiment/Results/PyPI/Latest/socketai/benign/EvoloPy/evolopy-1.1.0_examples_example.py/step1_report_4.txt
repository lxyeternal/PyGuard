{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to run a set of optimization algorithms (e.g., GA, PSO, GWO) on specified benchmark functions, with options to export results in various formats.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters for optimizer selection, benchmark functions, number of runs, and configuration parameters from hardcoded variables and external modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects. The run function may internally process data, but from this code alone, there are no suspicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (optimizer choices, objective functions, run count, parameters, export flags) flow into the run() function imported from an external module, which executes the optimization processes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward, setting parameters and calling an external function.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes paths and imports an optimizer module, sets configuration parameters and options, and calls a run function to execute optimization algorithms. All code is standard and lacks any suspicious behavior or malicious code. No user input is read dynamically; all parameters are hardcoded or imported. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup for running optimization algorithms with configurable parameters. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors, and does not perform any suspicious network activity or data leaks. The code appears safe and benign.",
