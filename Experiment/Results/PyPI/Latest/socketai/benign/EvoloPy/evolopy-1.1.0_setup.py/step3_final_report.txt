  "purpose": "Configure the packaging and installation parameters for the EvoloPy Python project, including metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points.",
  "sources": "Static files (README.md), hardcoded strings (package info), and defined entry points for CLI commands.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks; the script only reads static files and defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md to obtain long_description; static package metadata and dependencies; registering CLI command 'evolopy-run' that executes 'EvoloPy.cli:run_cli'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is a standard setup script with conventional structure and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, untrusted input handling, or obfuscated code. It reads a README file for description, specifies package info, dependencies, classifiers, URLs, and CLI entry points. The 'entry_points' define a CLI command that calls a function within the package, which is standard for CLI tools. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The script's structure and content are consistent with safe, legitimate package configuration. All signals indicate a benign setup process with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign configuration file for packaging a Python project. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements are present. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and appropriate given the code's nature.",
