{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'EvoloPy', used for package installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long_description; retrieves package metadata and dependencies within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the script primarily configures package setup without executing untrusted commands or handling untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads file content for description, then uses setup() to process package info, dependencies, and entry points — no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The script follows standard Python packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a documentation file to set package description, defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points. All operations are standard for a setup.py file. No code execution of untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious imports or behaviors identified. The use of hardcoded email, URLs, and package info is typical and not suspicious. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical and legitimate Python setup script for package distribution. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
