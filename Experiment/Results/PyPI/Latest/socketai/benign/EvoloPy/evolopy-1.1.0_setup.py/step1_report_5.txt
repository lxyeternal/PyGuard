  "purpose": "Setup script for the EvoloPy package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description; static string data for package metadata; specified dependencies in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No use of untrusted input or data that could lead to data leaks or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Reading file content to assign to long_description; static package configuration data flows into setup function parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script utilizing setuptools to configure package details. It reads a README file for documentation purposes and specifies dependencies explicitly. There are no dynamic imports, code evaluations, or network communications. The metadata appears typical and benign. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malicious payloads are present. The code structure is clear and conventional, with no anomalies or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. It adheres to common packaging practices.",
