  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the EvoloPy Python package including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file; static strings in setup() parameters; package directories and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; all data used for configuration appears static and trusted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; configuration is static and file reading is controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. Package setup appears standard and legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools. It reads a README file for long description and defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, entry points, and project URLs. All input sources are static files or hardcoded strings; dependencies are well-known packages. There are no dynamic code executions, input parsing, or untrusted data handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
