{
  "purpose": "This script is used to configure and set up a Python package named 'EvoloPy' for distribution via PyPI, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; no other external input sources; static package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; setup configuration does not involve data injection or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified; the script reads a file and supplies static data for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file for the long description, then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points. All operations are static and typical for package configuration. No external inputs, malicious behaviors, or anomalies are present. The dependencies are common scientific packages and do not pose security risks by themselves.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical and safe package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply prepares a Python package for distribution.",
