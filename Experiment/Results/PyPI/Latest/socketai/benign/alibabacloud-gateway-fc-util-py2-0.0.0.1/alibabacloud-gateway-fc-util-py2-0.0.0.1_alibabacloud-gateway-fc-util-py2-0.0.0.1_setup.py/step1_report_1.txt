  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the 'setup()' function call with package metadata; no external or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code only specifies static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious behavior detected. The description indicates a placeholder package, and author details are empty, but these are not malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, description, and classifiers with no dynamic or suspicious elements. No input validation, data processing, or external data fetching occurs. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. The empty author and author_email fields are typical placeholders and do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup configuration with no malicious behavior or security issues identified. It appears to be a placeholder package definition for distribution, with no suspicious elements.",
