  "purpose": "Define package metadata for a Python distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call: name, version, author, author_email, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code or behaviors, no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, defining metadata like name, version, author info, and classifiers. It does not include any code that reads input, executes dynamic code, or interacts with external data sources. No potential security risks or malicious behavior are evident. It appears to be a placeholder package with minimal information.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to define package metadata, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
