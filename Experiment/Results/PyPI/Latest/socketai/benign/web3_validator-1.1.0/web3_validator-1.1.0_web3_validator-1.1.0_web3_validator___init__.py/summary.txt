  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cross-chain validation tool that performs minimal transactions to verify network connectivity and balances. It handles private keys securely for signing and does not contain malicious logic. The main concern is operational—possible fund depletion if used excessively—but this does not indicate malicious activity. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscation is absent, and the security risk is low to moderate due to fund transfer behavior. Overall, the code is safe for use with proper key management and awareness of its operational nature."
