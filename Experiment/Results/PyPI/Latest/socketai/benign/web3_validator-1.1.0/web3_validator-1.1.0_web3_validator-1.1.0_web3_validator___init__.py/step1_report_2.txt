  "purpose": "The code performs validation of blockchain endpoints (Ethereum, BSC, Solana) by executing small transactions to specific contract addresses to verify connectivity and functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters: private keys (`from_private_key`) and RPC URLs (`rpc_url`). It also retrieves blockchain balances, transaction counts, and block hashes.",
  "sinks": "The code creates and signs transactions, then broadcasts them to the respective blockchain networks, resulting in blockchain state changes (transfers to validation addresses).",
  "flows": "Source inputs (private keys, RPC URLs) flow into transaction creation and signing processes, then into network broadcasting functions which produce on-chain transactions. The flow involves reading sensitive data, then performing transactions that modify blockchain state.",
  "anomalies": "The code unconditionally executes small transactions (validation transfers) on all endpoints every time the functions are called, which may be considered suspicious if not documented. No hardcoded secrets other than fixed addresses; no obfuscated code. The transaction amount is derived from the balance minus fee, which could lead to unnecessary fund depletion if called repeatedly. No backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The private key is used directly without encryption or obfuscation, but this is common in such scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script validates blockchain endpoints by sending small transfers to predefined validation addresses on Ethereum, BSC, and Solana. It reads the private key to sign transactions, fetches balances and network info, and sends transactions. The code does not contain hidden behaviors or obfuscated code. It performs legitimate blockchain operations aligned with endpoint validation but could potentially be misused if invoked maliciously (e.g., to drain funds or flood networks). There is no evidence of malware such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system damage. The repeated validation transactions might be suspicious if used excessively or without user awareness. Overall, the code performs straightforward blockchain transactions with no malicious intent evident.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is endpoint validation via small blockchain transfers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. While it performs fund-consuming transactions, this is consistent with validation activities. No obfuscation or malware signals detected. Its security risk is low but should be used with awareness of potential fund depletion if called repeatedly. The code appears legitimate and non-malicious, intended for validation purposes.",
