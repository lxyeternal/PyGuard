  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'web3_validator' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; package dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "Installation of dependencies; no direct data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reading README file (source) leading to package setup; dependencies specified for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads a README file for long description and specifies dependencies required for the package. The dependencies include web3, solana, and solders, which are common in blockchain-related projects. No input validation, dynamic code execution, or network communication occurs here. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only manages package metadata and dependencies.",
