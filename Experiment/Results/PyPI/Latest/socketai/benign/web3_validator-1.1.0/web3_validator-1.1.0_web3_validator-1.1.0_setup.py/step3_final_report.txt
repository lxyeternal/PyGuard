  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'web3_validator' Python library, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata and dependencies in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution; no data leaks or security-sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, conventional setup script with no suspicious or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script that reads a README file and specifies package info and dependencies. No dynamic code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior. Dependencies are common blockchain libraries. No network activity or code injection present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The only minor discrepancy is a report assigning a security risk of 0.1, which is unwarranted given the code's simplicity and lack of risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The slight security risk score of 0.1 should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy. Overall, the package is safe, and no security concerns are present.",
