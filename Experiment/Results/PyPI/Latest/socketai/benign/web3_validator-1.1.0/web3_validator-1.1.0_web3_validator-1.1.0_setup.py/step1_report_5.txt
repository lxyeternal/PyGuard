{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package named 'web3_validator' with metadata and dependencies for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; retrieves package dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data processed or executed within the code.",
  "flows": "Reads file content (README.md) as input; specifies dependencies for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. The code performs standard setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads a markdown file for long description, and defines package metadata including dependencies. No code injection, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. No network activity or code execution beyond standard package setup. All dependencies are typical for blockchain-related packages. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs standard setup tasks without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
