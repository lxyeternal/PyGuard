  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'web3_validator' that facilitates transferring crypto assets across blockchains.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description content.",
  "targets": "The setup() function defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content → Passing package metadata to setup() → Installing specified dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no obfuscated or malicious behavior detected. The dependencies are common blockchain libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package using setuptools, reading a README file for long description, and specifying dependencies for blockchain-related libraries. No malicious code, backdoors, or anomalous behaviors are present. The dependencies are typical for a blockchain utility package, with no suspicious network or system calls. The code structure and formatting are standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It merely defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
