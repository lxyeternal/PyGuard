  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'web3_validator' that facilitates transferring crypto assets across blockchains.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; no execution of untrusted code or data in the script.",
  "flows": "Reading file content (source) to variable 'long_description', then passing parameters to 'setup()' function (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard package setup procedures without suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for a Python package, importing 'setuptools', reading a README file, and invoking 'setup()' with package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted data, and no obfuscated or malicious code present. The dependencies listed are common blockchain-related packages. The code strictly performs package configuration tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library related to blockchain asset transfer. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
