{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple functions for reading and saving images using the skimage library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'path' parameter provided to the read_image and save_image functions.",
  "sinks": "The imsave function writes an image to a specified file path.",
  "flows": "Input path from user → imread/imsave functions → file system write operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two straightforward functions: one reads an image from a given path, and the other saves an image to a specified location. Both functions use standard skimage.io methods without any dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. No data is leaked, nor are there signs of malicious behavior. The input and output are typical for image processing tasks, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic image I/O operations using standard library functions without any malicious or suspicious activity. It appears safe and benign.",
