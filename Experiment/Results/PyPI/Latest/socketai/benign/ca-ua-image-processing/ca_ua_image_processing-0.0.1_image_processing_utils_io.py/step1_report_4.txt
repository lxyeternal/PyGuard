{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to read and save images using skimage.io functions.",
  "sources": "The function read_image reads data from a file path provided as input.",
  "sinks": "The save_image function writes image data to a specified file path.",
  "flows": "Input path → imread → output image; image data → save_image → file at path",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code structures observed. The code uses standard library functions without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two straightforward functions: read_image and save_image, which internally use skimage.io.imread and skimage.io.imsave. These functions handle image file reading and writing, respectively. There are no external data inputs beyond file paths, and no network communication, environment variable usage, or other suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or potentially malicious code segments are present. The code is simple and aligns with typical image processing tasks, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for image reading and writing operations, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
