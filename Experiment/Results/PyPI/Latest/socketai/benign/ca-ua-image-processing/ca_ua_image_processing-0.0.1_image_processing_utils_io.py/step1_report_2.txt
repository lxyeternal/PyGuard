{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple functions to read and save images using the skimage library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the image file specified by the 'path' parameter in 'read_image'.",
  "sinks": "The 'save_image' function writes image data to a file at the specified 'path'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'path' input in 'read_image' to the 'imread' function, and from 'image' variable in 'save_image' to 'imsave', with file paths used as data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behavior observed. Usage of skimage functions is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two straightforward functions for image I/O operations using the skimage library. There is no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs. The code's purpose is clearly for image processing, with input and output controlled by the caller. No hardcoded secrets or potentially malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and performs standard image read/write operations. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code snippet.",
