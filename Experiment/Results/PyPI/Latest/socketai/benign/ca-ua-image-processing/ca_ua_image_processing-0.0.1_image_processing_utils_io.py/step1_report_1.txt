{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to read and save images using the skimage library.",
  "sources": "The 'path' parameter in both 'read_image' and 'save_image' functions, which accept file path inputs.",
  "sinks": "The 'imsave' function that writes image data to a specified file path.",
  "flows": "The 'path' input flows from user input or external source into 'imread' and 'imsave'.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard library functions without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports image reading and writing functions from skimage.io, defines straightforward wrapper functions for reading and saving images, passing parameters directly without validation. There are no signs of malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The functions perform simple I/O operations with no additional processing or secret handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic image I/O operations without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears to be legitimate utility code with no security concerns.",
