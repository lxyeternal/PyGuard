{
  "purpose": "To read and save images using skimage.io functions.",
  "sources": "The function read_image reads image data from a provided file path; imread reads input from a file specified by 'path'.",
  "sinks": "The save_image function writes image data to a specified file path using imsave.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> imread -> image data -> save_image -> output file path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. Functions are straightforward wrappers around skimage.io methods. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple functions to read and save images using skimage's imread and imsave. There are no external data sources other than file paths, which are parameters. The functions do not perform any data processing beyond calling library functions. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code is clean, minimal, and appears to serve a standard image I/O purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic image reading and writing without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward utility with no suspicious behavior.",
