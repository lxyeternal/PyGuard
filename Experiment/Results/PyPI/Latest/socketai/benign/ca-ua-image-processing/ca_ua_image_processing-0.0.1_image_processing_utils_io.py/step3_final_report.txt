  "purpose": "Simple utility functions for reading and saving images using skimage.io.",
  "sources": "Input file path in read_image(), parameters passed to imread; output path in save_image(), parameters passed to imsave.",
  "sinks": "imread and imsave functions, which handle file I/O; no untrusted data flow beyond file paths.",
  "flows": "Input path -> imread -> image data -> return; image data -> imsave -> file at output path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures detected; straightforward wrapper functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports skimage.io functions, defines two functions that directly call these with provided parameters, and performs no additional processing. No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no dynamic code execution. The functions are simple and transparent, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. Input validation is not included but is outside the scope of this utility. Overall, the code is a safe, standard image I/O utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for image reading and writing with no malicious or security concerns. The reports accurately reflect this, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
