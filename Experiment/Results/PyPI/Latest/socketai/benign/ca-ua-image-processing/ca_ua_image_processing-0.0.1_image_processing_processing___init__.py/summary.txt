  "conclusion": "The code shows potential security risks related to subprocess usage with untrusted inputs but no confirmed malicious activity. Scores are justified: malware at 0, obfuscation at 0, and a low to moderate security risk (~0.3). No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are consistent with the evidence."
