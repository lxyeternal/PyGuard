  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and data flow anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, files, subprocess calls, system commands, input functions",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, file writes, environment variables",
  "flows": "From untrusted input sources (environment variables, files) to subprocess/system commands and network connections",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with unvalidated inputs, potential command injection risk; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables and files, then executes system commands via subprocess, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The subprocess usage with untrusted data presents a potential security concern, but no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware. The risk score of 0.3 in the original report appropriately reflects this potential, and malware score remains at 0 due to lack of malicious indicators. The code structure appears benign otherwise, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows potential security risks related to subprocess usage with untrusted inputs but no confirmed malicious activity. Scores are justified: malware at 0, obfuscation at 0, and a low to moderate security risk (~0.3). No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are consistent with the evidence.",
