  "purpose": "Resize an image based on a given proportion using skimage's resize function.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'image' and 'proportion' used for image dimensions calculation.",
  "sinks": "The 'resize' function from skimage.transform, which processes the image data.",
  "flows": "Input image and proportion flow into calculations for new dimensions, then into the resize function which outputs the resized image.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No use of obfuscated code or hidden actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to resize an image by a given proportion. It asserts that 'proportion' is between 0 and 1, calculates new dimensions, and uses skimage.transform.resize to perform the resizing with anti-aliasing. No external data leakage, no network communication, and no suspicious behavior observed. The code appears to be straightforward image processing logic without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image resizing function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a legitimate operation without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
