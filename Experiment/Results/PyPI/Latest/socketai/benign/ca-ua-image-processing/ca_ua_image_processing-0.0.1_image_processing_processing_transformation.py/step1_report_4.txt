{
  "purpose": "Resize an input image proportionally using skimage.transform.resize.",
  "sources": "Reads input image array from the parameter 'image'. Reads 'proportion' argument for scaling factor.",
  "sinks": "Returns the resized image; no sinks that process untrusted data directly beyond the resize function.",
  "flows": "Input 'image' and 'proportion' flow into resize calculations, resulting in 'image_resized' being returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic code execution, and no suspicious variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'resize' from skimage.transform, asserts that 'proportion' is between 0 and 1, calculates new dimensions, and applies 'resize' to the input image. It performs standard image resizing without any network activity, data leakage, or malicious operations. No use of environment variables, no suspicious data handling, and no signs of malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward image resizing function with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply processes the input image as intended without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
