  "purpose": "A simple utility function to resize an image proportionally using skimage.transform.resize.",
  "sources": "Input image passed as 'image' parameter, and 'proportion' parameter for scaling factor.",
  "sinks": "The resized image 'image_resized' returned; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input image and proportion are used to compute new dimensions, which are then passed to resize function, resulting in resized image.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard validation and processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation with 'assert', calculates new dimensions based on the proportion, and calls skimage.transform.resize with anti_aliasing=True. It contains no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code. The logic is clear and standard for image resizing tasks. No external data leaks, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code's simplicity and correctness suggest no security risks or malware. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, and confidence: 1 are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard image resizing utility with no malicious or security concerns. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
