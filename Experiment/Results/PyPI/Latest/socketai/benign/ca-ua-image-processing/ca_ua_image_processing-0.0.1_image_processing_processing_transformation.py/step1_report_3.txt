  "purpose": "Resize an image proportionally using skimage.transform's resize function.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'image' (external image data), 'proportion' (scaling factor).",
  "sinks": "The resize function processes the image; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input image and proportion are used to compute new dimensions, then passed to resize; no data leaks or malicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious imports or code constructs, no unusual behaviors, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'resize' from skimage.transform, defines a function to resize an image based on a given proportion, with an assertion to validate input. It computes new dimensions and performs resizing with anti_aliasing. No user input is directly read from untrusted sources; the only data input is the image and proportion parameters, which are used safely within the function. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code appears to be a standard image processing utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a legitimate image resizing operation without any malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. Overall, it is safe and standard for image processing tasks.",
