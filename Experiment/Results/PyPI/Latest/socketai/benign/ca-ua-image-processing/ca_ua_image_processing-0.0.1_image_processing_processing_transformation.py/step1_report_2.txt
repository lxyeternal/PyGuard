  "purpose": "Resize an input image proportionally using skimage.transform.resize.",
  "sources": "Reads input image and the 'proportion' parameter as function argument.",
  "sinks": "Returns the resized image; no data leakage or external data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input image and 'proportion' flow into the resize function, producing a resized image as output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Usage of assert for input validation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the resize function from skimage.transform and defines a function to resize an image based on a given proportion. It asserts the proportion is within [0,1], calculates new dimensions, and applies the resize function with anti-aliasing. The code performs a straightforward image resize operation with no external network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present. It is a standard image processing utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign image resizing function without malicious intent or security risks.",
