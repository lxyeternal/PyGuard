  "purpose": "Resize an image proportionally using skimage.transform.resize.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'image' (likely a numpy array), 'proportion' (a float between 0 and 1).",
  "sinks": "The resize function which outputs the resized image; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input image and proportion are used to calculate new dimensions, then passed to resize function to produce output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. Usage of resize appears standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard image processing function, defines a function to resize an image based on a proportion, validates the proportion input, calculates new dimensions, and applies skimage.transform.resize with anti-aliasing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious side-effects. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical image processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and solely focused on resizing images. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is evident.",
