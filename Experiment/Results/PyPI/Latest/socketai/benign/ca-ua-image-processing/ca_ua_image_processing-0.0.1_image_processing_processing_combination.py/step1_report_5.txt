{
  "purpose": "The code performs image processing tasks such as comparing images for differences and matching histograms between images.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'image1' and 'image2' in functions 'find_difference' and 'transfer_histogram', which are expected to be image data arrays.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks; the code processes images and returns processed images or similarity scores. No untrusted data output or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "Images are input into functions; 'find_difference' computes similarity and normalized difference; 'transfer_histogram' matches histograms. No data leaks or external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code uses standard image processing functions without any obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard image processing libraries and defines two functions: one for comparing images using structural similarity and normalizing the difference, and another for matching histograms. There are assertions and normal function operations with no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign image processing script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard operations without any anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
