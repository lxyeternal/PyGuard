{
  "purpose": "The code performs image comparison and histogram matching tasks using standard image processing libraries.",
  "sources": "The functions read input images passed as parameters; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input images are processed through rgb2gray, match_histograms, and structural_similarity functions without external data flow beyond parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code uses well-known libraries (numpy, skimage) for image similarity and histogram matching. It converts images to grayscale, compares them with structural similarity, and normalizes the difference image. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The functions perform legitimate image processing tasks. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are identified. The code's behavior aligns with benign image analysis utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign image processing utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
