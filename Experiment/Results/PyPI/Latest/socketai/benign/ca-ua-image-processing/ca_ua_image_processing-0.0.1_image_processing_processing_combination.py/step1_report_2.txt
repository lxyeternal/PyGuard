{
  "purpose": "The code performs image comparison and histogram matching, likely for image analysis or processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Input images 'image1' and 'image2' passed as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Output of functions: the normalized difference image and the histogram-matched image.",
  "flows": "Input images are processed to convert to grayscale and compare similarity; images are also used for histogram matching.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code present. Uses standard image processing libraries without suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common scientific libraries for image processing. 'find_difference' converts images to grayscale, computes structural similarity, normalizes the difference image. 'transfer_histogram' performs histogram matching. No network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected. No suspicious data handling or malicious intent apparent. The code performs legitimate image processing operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward image processing utility without malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or indicators of malware are present.",
