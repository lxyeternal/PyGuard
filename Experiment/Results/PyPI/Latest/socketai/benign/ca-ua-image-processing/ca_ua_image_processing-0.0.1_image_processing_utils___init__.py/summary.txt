  "conclusion": "The existing report scores are generally appropriate, with minor room for adjustment to better reflect suspicion levels in reports 2 and 5. The absence of code in some reports correctly results in zero scores. The detailed analysis supports the current scoring, indicating moderate security concern primarily driven by suspicious patterns rather than confirmed malicious actions."
