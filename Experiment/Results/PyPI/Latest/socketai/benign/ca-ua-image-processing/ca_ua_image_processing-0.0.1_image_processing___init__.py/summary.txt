  "conclusion": "Overall, the code reviews are cautious and consistent. The primary concern is report 5, where obfuscation and dynamic execution suggest a higher potential for malicious behavior. Increasing the malware score from 0.2 to 0.3 in report 5 improves alignment with observed indicators. Other reports are appropriately scored with low malware and risk levels. Vigilance is advised for obfuscated code, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed."
