{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads README.md and requirements.txt for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading static files 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt'; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or untrusted data effects, as the code only reads files and calls setup().",
  "flows": "Reading files -> passing data to setup() without modification or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, well-structured setup script with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools. It reads static files for description and requirements, then invokes setup() with standard parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, embedded secrets, or obfuscation is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence. The code's simplicity and adherence to best practices confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
