  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n- The code is a standard Python `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n- It reads `README.md` for `long_description` and `requirements.txt` for dependencies.\n- It calls `setup()` with typical parameters: name, version, author, description, long description, URL, packages, install_requires, and python_requires.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or embedded secrets.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports concur that the script is a standard setup configuration.\n- They emphasize the absence of anomalies, malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n- Malware scores are all 0, with no indication of malicious intent.\n- Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code matches the descriptions and analysis provided.\n- No issues are present that would warrant concern.\n- The reported scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The absence of anomalies, obfuscation, malware, or security risks is well-supported.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned in the reports seem appropriate and justified.\n- Since the code is a typical package setup script, no changes to scores are necessary.\n- The malware score should remain 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0, given the straightforward code.\n- The risk score should remain at 0, reflecting no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are accurate and justified based on the code and reports.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the thorough analysis and consensus of the reports.",
