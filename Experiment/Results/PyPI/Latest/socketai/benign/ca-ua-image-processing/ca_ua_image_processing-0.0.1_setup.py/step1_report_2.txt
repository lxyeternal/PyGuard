  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python project called 'ca-ua-image-processing'. It reads metadata and dependencies from files and configures the package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description and 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks, external communication, or execution of untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') into variables, then into the setup() function. No external data or untrusted inputs are processed at runtime beyond file reading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to follow standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads project metadata and dependencies from external files, and calls setup() with typical package configuration parameters. All file reads are straightforward and related to package setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden malicious instructions. No suspicious code patterns or anomalies are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a project. It performs typical operations without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
