  "purpose": "This script is used to set up a Python package for distribution, specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' for long description, reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; setup configurations are standard.",
  "flows": "Reads data from files (README.md and requirements.txt) and uses that data to configure package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setup procedures from setuptools, reads description and requirements files, and calls setup() with typical arguments. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The files read are common for packaging purposes. No unusual code structures, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no embedded secrets or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It properly reads external files for package description and dependencies, following best practices.",
