  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing a Python image processing library.",
  "sources": "Reads content from 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'install_requires' for dependency installation, and the setup() function to define package metadata.",
  "flows": "File contents are read and assigned to variables, then passed into setup() as parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious functions or behavior. The code is standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the project description and requirements from external files, then invokes setup() to package the project. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling observed. The code appears straightforward and typical for Python package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It merely reads external files and configures package metadata.",
