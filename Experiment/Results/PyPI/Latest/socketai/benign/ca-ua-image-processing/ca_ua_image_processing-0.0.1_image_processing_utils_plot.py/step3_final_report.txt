  "purpose": "Visualization of images and histograms using matplotlib functions.",
  "sources": "Input image data passed as function arguments in plot_image, plot_result, and plot_histogram.",
  "sinks": "None; functions only display images and histograms locally without external data transmission or storage.",
  "flows": "Input images flow into plotting functions and are rendered via plt.show(); no data manipulation or external data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three visualization functions that operate solely on provided image data, displaying images and histograms via matplotlib. There are no network operations, data fetching, code execution, or data manipulation. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Multiple reviews agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's behavior aligns with standard visualization routines, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a standard image visualization utility. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
