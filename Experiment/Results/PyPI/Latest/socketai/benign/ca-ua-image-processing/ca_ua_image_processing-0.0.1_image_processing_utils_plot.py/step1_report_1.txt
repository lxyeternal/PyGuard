{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing images and their histograms using matplotlib, primarily for image analysis and display.",
  "sources": "The code reads image data passed as arguments to the plotting functions.",
  "sinks": "The code displays images and histograms using plt.show(), which is a standard visualization function. No sinks are used for untrusted data manipulation or output beyond visualization.",
  "flows": "Image data is passed from the source functions to the matplotlib plotting functions, then displayed. There are no data flows involving untrusted input being used in insecure operations or malicious ways.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears to be straightforward visualization routines.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions for plotting: plot_image, plot_result, and plot_histogram. All functions use matplotlib to display images and histograms with no data manipulation or external data fetching. No use of eval, exec, dynamic code execution, or network operations is observed. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. It operates solely on provided image data, which is typical for visualization purposes. Overall, the code appears safe and standard for image visualization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of standard image visualization functions using matplotlib, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
