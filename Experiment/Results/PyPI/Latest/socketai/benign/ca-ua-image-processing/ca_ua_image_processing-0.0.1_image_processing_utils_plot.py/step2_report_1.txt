  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality Review:**\n   - The code defines three functions: `plot_image`, `plot_result`, and `plot_histogram`.\n   - All functions use matplotlib to display images and histograms.\n   - There are no data manipulations, external data fetching, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code operates solely on the input images passed as arguments, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Findings:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is straightforward visualization code.\n   - They note the absence of anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - The reports correctly identify that no data flows involve untrusted data manipulation beyond visualization.\n   - No report suggests any suspicious patterns or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis; the code is benign.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely for visualization.\n   - The use of `plt.show()` is standard and does not introduce security issues.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is safe, standard visualization code.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n   - No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and reasonable based on the analysis.",
