{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing images and their histograms using matplotlib.",
  "sources": "The functions read image data passed as function arguments (parameters), specifically 'image' and 'args'.",
  "sinks": "The functions call plt.show() to display plots, which does not pose security risks. No external or untrusted data is sent over the network or stored.",
  "flows": "Input image data flows into plotting functions; there are no data flows leading to insecure operations or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code is straightforward visualization code without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three visualization functions: 'plot_image' for displaying a single image, 'plot_result' for displaying multiple images with titles, and 'plot_histogram' for plotting histograms of RGB channels. All functions use matplotlib for plotting, with no data manipulation beyond visualization. There are no external data sources, no network connections, no file I/O, and no execution of untrusted code. The code is standard plotting code and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization utility for images and histograms, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
