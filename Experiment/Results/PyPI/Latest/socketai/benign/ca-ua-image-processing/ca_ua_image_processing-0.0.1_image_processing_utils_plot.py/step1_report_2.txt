{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to plot images and histograms for visualization purposes, likely used in image processing workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads input images passed as function arguments.",
  "targets": "The code displays images and histograms; no data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input images are processed and displayed via matplotlib functions; no external data flows or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. Variable naming and code structure are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three functions: plot_image, plot_result, and plot_histogram, all of which generate plots using matplotlib. The functions take image data as input and display them without performing any data modification, storage, or network communication. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected. The code is standard visualization code with no embedded malicious payloads or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely intended for visualizing image data. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks based on the provided content.",
