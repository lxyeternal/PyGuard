{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing images and histograms using matplotlib.",
  "sources": "The code reads image data passed as arguments to the functions.",
  "sinks": "The code displays images and histograms; no sinks for untrusted data manipulation or external data leakage are present.",
  "flows": "Input images are taken as function parameters and displayed through matplotlib; no data flows to external systems or networks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. No obfuscated or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three visualization functions: plot_image, plot_result, and plot_histogram. Each uses matplotlib to display images and histograms with configurable parameters. There are no input sanitization issues, external data transmissions, or suspicious code patterns. The functions operate purely locally, and there is no code that could be used maliciously or cause security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image visualization utility with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be safe for use.",
