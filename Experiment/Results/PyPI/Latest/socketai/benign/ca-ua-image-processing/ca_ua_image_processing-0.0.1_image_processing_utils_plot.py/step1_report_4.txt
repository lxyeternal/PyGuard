{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing images and their histograms, likely for image processing or analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "The functions accept images as input parameters; these are the data sources being read.",
  "sinks": "The code uses plt.show() to display images, but does not write or transmit data externally; no sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "Input images are passed into functions; data is processed (e.g., slicing channels for histograms), and visualized locally via matplotlib display calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code solely performs visualization tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three visualization functions: plot_image, plot_result, and plot_histogram. Each takes image data and creates plots using matplotlib. No external data transmission, code injection, or malicious behavior observed. The functions appear straightforward, focusing on displaying images and histograms with no suspicious logic or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely focused on image visualization tasks. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are present. It is safe to use.",
