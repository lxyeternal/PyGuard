  "purpose": "A utility for managing configuration flags using classes, global sets, and functions to set, get, and check flags.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, global variables, functions operating on in-memory data structures",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or system calls",
  "flows": "In-memory data manipulation within functions and class methods",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or external data handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Flag class with custom hashing, global sets for default options, and functions to configure and retrieve flags. It operates solely on in-memory data structures without external interactions. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is straightforward configuration management, and all functions are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for managing configuration flags with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any external data handling, network communication, or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
