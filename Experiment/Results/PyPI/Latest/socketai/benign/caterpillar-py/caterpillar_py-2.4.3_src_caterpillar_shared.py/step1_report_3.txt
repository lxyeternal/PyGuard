{
  "purpose": "Defines an Action class for executing custom functions during struct parsing or processing, used for operations like checksums or stream modifications.",
  "sources": "No direct input sources; code defines classes and constants used in struct processing.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; no untrusted data handling or output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines a class with optional callables for struct processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The class is standard for a struct processing library.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition for Action objects that encapsulate callable functions for pre-processing during serialization/deserialization. It includes clear documentation, no external input handling, no network activity, and no data leaks. The functions are user-supplied and optional, with no embedded or hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code appears to be part of a larger framework for data structuring, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility class used in struct processing, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured and documented, serving a benign purpose within a larger data handling framework.",
