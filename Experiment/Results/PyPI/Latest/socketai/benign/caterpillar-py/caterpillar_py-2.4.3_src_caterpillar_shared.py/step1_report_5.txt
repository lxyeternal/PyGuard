{
  "purpose": "This code defines a framework for executing custom actions during the parsing or processing of data structures, such as hashing or modifying streams, in the context of a serialization/deserialization library.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs directly; it defines classes, constants, and methods for internal use within a data processing context.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present; the code does not handle or transmit external data directly.",
  "flows": "The code creates Action objects with callable attributes that can be invoked during struct processing; however, actual flow depends on external usage where these actions are called.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; the code primarily consists of class definitions and constants for internal logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an Action class used for executing custom functions before serializing or deserializing data structures. It uses standard Python features and type annotations. There are no hardcoded secrets, network operations, or other malicious behaviors. The functions are purely for internal callback mechanisms. The class includes a method to identify whether an object is an action, based on attribute presence, which is a benign pattern. Overall, the code appears to be part of a serialization framework with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious component of a serialization/deserialization framework, enabling custom actions during data processing. It contains no malware or security risks, and no suspicious or obfuscated code is present.",
