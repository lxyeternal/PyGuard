{
  "purpose": "Defines an Action class for encapsulating optional callables to be executed during struct processing, such as serialization or deserialization hooks.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the callables are stored as attributes and are intended to be invoked elsewhere in the framework.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or external system interactions; the code does not process or execute data directly.",
  "flows": "The stored callables (pack and unpack functions) are assigned but not invoked within this code snippet; invocation occurs externally during struct processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a benign utility class for managing custom actions during data struct processing. It uses standard Python features such as __slots__, type annotations, and clear documentation. The class stores user-defined callables for pre-processing during packing and unpacking, but does not execute or invoke them within this snippet. There are no external data handling, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. The design is straightforward and intended for internal framework use, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility component with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The provided reports are accurate and consistent, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
