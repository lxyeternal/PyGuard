{
  "purpose": "Defines an Action class to represent executable operations during the parsing or processing of data structures, such as custom hooks or calculations during serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "No direct data input sources identified in the code; the code defines classes and constants related to struct processing.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmissions are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; the class manages callable attributes for internal processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation present. The code primarily defines a class for internal use, with comments indicating planned or existing features.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an Action class to encapsulate functions to be invoked during data struct processing. It includes methods for representation and type checking. No external data input, network activity, or file operations are involved. The callable attributes are intended for internal hooks or logic during serialization/deserialization. The code appears standard, with clear comments and no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard internal utility class for struct processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly facilitates execution of custom functions during data handling, without external communication or sensitive data handling.",
