{
  "purpose": "Define an 'Action' class for executing custom functions during struct packing or unpacking in a serialization framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external data; it only defines classes, constants, and methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the class stores callable references but does not execute them on untrusted input within this code.",
  "flows": "No active data flow from sources to sinks; the code defines structures for potential future use but does not invoke external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Contains no suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The callables stored are user-defined and are not invoked here.",
  "analysis": "The code is a class definition for 'Action' with associated constants, documentation, and utility methods. It does not perform any data processing or I/O, nor does it execute stored functions at this stage. It merely provides a structure for attaching callable actions to be executed during serialization/deserialization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or secret backdoors. The code appears to be a standard, well-documented component of a larger serialization framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard class definition for managing actions in a serialization context. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. No security risks are present within this snippet.",
