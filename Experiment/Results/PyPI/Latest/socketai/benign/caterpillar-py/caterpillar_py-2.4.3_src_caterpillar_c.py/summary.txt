  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions as a utility for struct creation via a C API. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The primary concern is the wildcard import from an internal module, which warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall security risk remains low, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a minimal risk score (~0.1)."
