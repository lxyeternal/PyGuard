{
  "purpose": "Decorator for creating struct classes using a C API, wrapping classes with Struct objects for low-level data handling.",
  "sources": "Import from 'caterpillar._C' via wildcard; class parameter 'cls' as input; internal 'Struct' class/function as used in the decorator.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; no network, file, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input class or no class (for wrapper); the decorator applies Struct to the class; no external data flow or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from internal/native extension module 'caterpillar._C', which can obscure imported symbols and pose security risks if compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for defining C API-based structs via a decorator pattern. The wildcard import from a private/internal module is a concern but not malicious. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration are present. The scores across reports are consistent, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, with a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) mainly due to import style. The code's logic is standard, with no external data handling or system modifications. The main external risk stems from the import method, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions as a utility for struct creation via a C API. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The primary concern is the wildcard import from an internal module, which warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall security risk remains low, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a minimal risk score (~0.1).",
