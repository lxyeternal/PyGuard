{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator for creating new struct classes using a C API, facilitating the definition of structured data types with optional configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a symbol from the 'caterpillar._C' module and uses function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs and returns new class types via the Struct constructor, which could potentially execute or manipulate class definitions. No direct data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "The import from 'caterpillar._C' feeds into class creation, and the decorator returns a class object, but there are no untrusted data flows or external data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement uses a private module '_C', which might indicate internal or compiled code, but this alone is not suspicious. The code appears to be a typical decorator pattern without obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol from a private module, which suggests reliance on internal or compiled components. The 'struct' decorator wraps a class using the 'Struct' constructor with specific options, returning a new class type. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code appears straightforward, with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Its purpose is to provide a convenient decorator for struct class creation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard decorator implementation for struct classes utilizing a C API. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks. It relies on internal modules but does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
