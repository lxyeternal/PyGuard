The primary concern is the wildcard import from an internal module, which warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall security risk remains low, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a minimal risk score (~0.1)."

The slight elevation of security risk scores in some reports (e.g., 0.1) is overly cautious; these should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. Overall, the code poses no security threat."

The overall security risk is very low, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The slight increase in security risk score (around 0.1) due to wildcard imports is justified but does not indicate any threat."

The reported issues about mismatched argument names are based on a misunderstanding of argparse's behavior. The security risk is negligible, and malware score is 0. Obfuscation score is 0. The overall risk score should be 0 or very close to it."
