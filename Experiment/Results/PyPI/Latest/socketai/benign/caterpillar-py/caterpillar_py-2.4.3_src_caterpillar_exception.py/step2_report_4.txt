  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Obfuscation**  \n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.  \n   - No external data handling, network calls, or code obfuscation are present.  \n   - The code is straightforward, well-documented, and follows standard Python practices.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \n   - No logical errors or mistakes are evident.  \n   - The use of optional context in `StructException` is appropriate and well-implemented.  \n   - Exception classes are correctly inheriting from a base class, with descriptive docstrings.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the analysis.  \n   - The risk scores are all 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**  \n   - No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis is cautious and accurate.  \n   - The import from `caterpillar.abc` is noted but not suspicious, as it appears to be a legitimate dependency.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness**  \n   - The scores align well with the code's content and the analysis provided.  \n   - No inconsistencies or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely structural, defining exception classes with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The detailed analysis confirms the benign nature, and the scores reflect that accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is safe, standard, and free of malware or obfuscation.**",
