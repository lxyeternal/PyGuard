{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to struct parsing and validation in a library or application.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading; code defines classes and methods only.",
  "sinks": "No data output or external communication; purely local exception class definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected; standard class and exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various exception types, inheriting from a base exception class. The __init__ method in StructException conditionally adds a note if context is provided, which is standard practice. There are no data handling, network operations, or code execution mechanisms present. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a larger framework for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, well-structured exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any external operations or data handling that could be exploited or cause harm.",
