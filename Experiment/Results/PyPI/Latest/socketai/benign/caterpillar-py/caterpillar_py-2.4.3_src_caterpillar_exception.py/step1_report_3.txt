{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to data structures and parsing in a software system.",
  "sources": "Code imports 'caterpillar.abc' module, uses class definitions, and exception handling logic.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data handling, no external outputs, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "The code defines exception classes and their constructors; flow is limited to class instantiation and attribute setting.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. Exception classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base Exception class, with some added context handling. No input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no external data processing. The presence of detailed documentation and licensing comments suggests good coding practices. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase with standard exception handling.",
