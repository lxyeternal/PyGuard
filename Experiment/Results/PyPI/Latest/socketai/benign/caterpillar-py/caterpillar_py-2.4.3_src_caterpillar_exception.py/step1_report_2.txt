{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to 'struct'-like operations in a software system, providing specific error types for different failure modes.",
  "sources": "None; the code defines classes and imports modules, no data input points or external data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines exception classes and does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or data processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs identified. The code appears to be straightforward class definitions with standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single module and defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. Each class has descriptive docstrings and simple constructors, with optional context handling in the base class. No code execution, data processing, or external interactions are present. The structure is standard and typical for error handling in Python applications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. The content is consistent with a module intended for exception management.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines custom exception classes for error handling purposes and contains no malicious or suspicious activity. It appears to be a well-structured, benign component of a larger software system, with no security concerns.",
