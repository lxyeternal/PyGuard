  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for struct-related errors with optional contextual information.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines classes and imports a type interface.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation and exception raising; no data flow or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'add_note' method in the exception constructor without visible definition; potential for runtime error if not defined elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various exception types inheriting from StructException, which itself manages optional context info. The use of 'add_note' suggests an extension or framework-specific method, but without its definition, it could cause runtime issues. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling is present. The code is straightforward and standard for error handling. The import of '_ContextLike' from an external module is not suspicious but assumes correct implementation. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of custom exception classes for struct validation, with no malicious or suspicious features. The only minor concern is the undefined 'add_note' method, which should be verified in the broader codebase. Scores remain at 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
