  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base class, with optional context handling.\n- No external data input/output, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code appears to be straightforward, well-structured, and typical for error handling in Python.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are observed.\n- The only external dependency is the import of `caterpillar.abc._ContextLike`, which is not suspicious by itself.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is purely class definitions for exceptions; no malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or code injection are present.\n- The context attribute is used for richer exception info, which is standard practice.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the code. The exception classes are well-defined, with descriptive docstrings.\n- The use of `context` and `__context_getattr__('_path')` seems correct, assuming the imported `_ContextLike` interface is implemented properly elsewhere.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports. No malicious activity or code behavior is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 for all reports. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 for all reports. No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious code are present.\n\n### Any adjustments needed?\n- The scores assigned (all zeros for malware, obfuscated, and security risk) are consistent with the analysis.\n- The risk score is 0 across the reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The context handling in the exception class is standard but relies on the correct implementation of `_ContextLike` and its method `__context_getattr__('_path')`. If these are not implemented securely, it could pose a minor risk, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are justified based solely on class definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and typical for exception handling.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is purely structural exception class definitions with no malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
