{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions related to struct operations in a larger application.",
  "sources": "None; all data appears to be internal and predefined within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction is present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from source to sink since the code consists solely of class definitions and exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code follows standard exception class design.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception class, 'StructException'. The classes are designed to handle specific error cases related to struct operations, with no external data input or output, no network calls, and no suspicious code constructs. The only notable aspect is the use of a context attribute in 'StructException', which is typical for rich exception info but does not suggest malicious intent. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a structured way to handle various errors in a larger application, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard, well-structured exception handling code without any suspicious or malicious features.",
