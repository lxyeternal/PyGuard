{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of Protocol interfaces, type aliases, and utility functions for context management, data packing/unpacking, and structural metadata handling within a serialization framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code reads class attributes, type hints, and method signatures within the module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "The code establishes type and method signatures for potential source-to-sink flows, but no actual data flow occurs in this static interface code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract Protocol classes, type aliases, and utility functions for structural checks. It lacks implementation, data processing, or external interactions. The absence of runtime logic, network activity, or data handling indicates no malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, very low security risk) are consistent with this assessment. The code is a benign framework component, and no signs of sabotage or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, structural framework with no malicious behavior or security risks. The low scores are justified, and the code can be considered secure and non-obfuscated.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
