  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup with no malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation. The use of wildcard imports is a maintainability concern but not a security issue. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The slight increase in security risk score (around 0.1) due to wildcard imports is justified but does not indicate any threat."
