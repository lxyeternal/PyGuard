  "purpose": "Import statements for various internal modules related to data structures, byte order, context, exceptions, fields, models, options, and shared utilities.",
  "sources": "Local module imports, including specific classes, functions, and wildcard imports from modules like .abc, .registry, .byteorder, .context, .exception, .fields, .model, .options, ._common, .shared.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only imports modules and symbols, no data processing or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; static import statements only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from ... import *' in multiple modules, which can obscure symbol origins and affect maintainability but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, with no dynamic code, data handling, or network activity. The use of wildcard imports is a style concern but does not introduce security risks. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The minimal risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The absence of external data flows or runtime logic indicates a static setup module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup with no malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation. The use of wildcard imports is a maintainability concern but not a security issue. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The slight increase in security risk score (around 0.1) due to wildcard imports is justified but does not indicate any threat.",
