  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is solely import statements from local modules, with no data processing, network activity, or runtime code. The use of 'from ... import *' is noted but is typical in package setup.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Scores are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Risk Score (0.1):** Slightly above zero, perhaps considering the wildcard imports, but overall very low.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. No security risks or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that only import statements are present, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, securityRisk at 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The report correctly identifies the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, import statements only, with a note on wildcard imports ('*') as a minor maintainability concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, securityRisk at 0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. Wildcard imports are a best practice concern but not a security issue here.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—imports only, no malicious activity. The report emphasizes the static nature of the code.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, securityRisk at 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the extensive use of wildcard imports ('*') and notes potential maintainability concerns, but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, securityRisk at 0.2—slightly higher due to wildcard imports.\n- **Assessment:** The higher securityRisk score reflects the concern over wildcard imports, which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if present. However, given the context, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable, but perhaps the securityRisk score could be kept at 0 or 0.1, considering that wildcard imports are a maintainability concern but not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or actual data leaks.\n- **Use of wildcard imports:** Not ideal but common in package setup; does not constitute malware.\n- **Scores:** All reports appropriately assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0. The slight securityRisk scores are justified given the wildcard imports.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Security Risk Scores:** Should stay low (0 or 0.1), as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Justification for higher scores:** Only if there were signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads, which are absent here.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1 (due to wildcard imports, but overall very low)\n\n**Summary:** The code is standard package setup code, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor concern over wildcard imports does not translate into a security risk but is worth noting for maintainability.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's content. No significant changes are necessary.",
