  "purpose": "Detects native support availability by attempting to import 'caterpillar._C' and sets warning filters for deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from caterpillar import _C' within the 'native_support()' function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks; the import is conditional and handled safely.",
  "flows": "Function call to 'native_support()' triggers import attempt; exception handling prevents errors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import with exception handling and warning filtering.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module metadata, attempts a conditional import of 'caterpillar._C' within a function, and filters warnings for deprecation messages. The import is wrapped in try-except, which is standard for optional dependencies. No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The import's success or failure is handled gracefully, and warning filtering is a common pattern. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior are evident. The code's simplicity and standard practices indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign feature detection utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The slight elevation of security risk scores in some reports (e.g., 0.1) is overly cautious; these should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
