{
  "purpose": "The code defines metadata and a function to check for native support by importing a module, with deprecation warning handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads no user input or external data; it only attempts to import a module within the native_support() function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling native_support(), which tries to import 'caterpillar._C' and returns a boolean based on success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a try-except block for conditional import, which is normal, and sets warning filters. No suspicious or unusual code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports warnings, defines version and author metadata, and includes a function that conditionally imports a module to determine support status. It handles ImportError gracefully. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The warning filter setup is standard for deprecation handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, primarily providing support checking functionality and warning configuration. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
