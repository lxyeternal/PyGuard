  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is simple: defines metadata, a function to import a module conditionally, and sets warning filters.\n- The import occurs only when `native_support()` is called, with exception handling for missing modules.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code is present.\n- The purpose appears to be feature detection and warning configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The report correctly identifies that the code performs a straightforward import and warning filtering.\n- It notes no suspicious behavior or anomalies.\n- The confidence score is 1, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 — justified.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.\n- SecurityRisk: 0 — no risks identified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, it correctly states that the code is benign.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The confidence is 1, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- SecurityRisk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Same conclusions: straightforward import, no malicious activity.\n- Slightly more detailed in describing the purpose.\n- Confidence at 1 is justified.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- SecurityRisk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk score (0.1) are assigned.\n- The reasoning is that the import could potentially be a sink if it triggers malicious code, but this is unlikely here.\n- The code is standard for support detection.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n\n- The minor security risk score (0.1) seems overly cautious, given the code's simplicity.\n- The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n- The security risk score could be lowered to 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The malware score should remain 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is conservative but acceptable; scores could be slightly adjusted downward.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Similar to others, with a confidence of 1 and no malware or obfuscation.\n- The description is accurate.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- SecurityRisk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and performs standard support detection.\n- The main point of contention is the security risk score in Report 4, which is slightly elevated at 0.1, possibly overcautious.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all, no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** Should be 0 for all, as the code does not pose any real security risk.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | SecurityRisk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\n\nThe code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The conservative scores in some reports are justified but could be uniformly lowered to reflect the actual risk level.\n\n**Summary:** I recommend setting malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores to 0 across all reports, given the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
