{
  "purpose": "Provide a function to check for native support via importing a module, and handle deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "The import statement within the 'native_support' function, specifically 'from caterpillar import _C'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing 'caterpillar._C' when 'native_support()' is called; if import succeeds, returns True, otherwise returns False.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard import and warning filtering without any suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines metadata about the program and includes a function 'native_support' that attempts to import a module 'caterpillar' and its attribute '_C'. This import occurs only when 'native_support()' is called, and it handles ImportError gracefully. Warnings are filtered to show deprecation warnings from the 'caterpillar' module. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import check and warning configuration. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
