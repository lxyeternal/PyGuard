  "conclusion": "The code is a benign feature detection utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The slight elevation of security risk scores in some reports (e.g., 0.1) is overly cautious; these should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
