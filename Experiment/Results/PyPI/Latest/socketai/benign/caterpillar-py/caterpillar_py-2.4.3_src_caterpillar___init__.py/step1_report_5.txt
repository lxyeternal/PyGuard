{
  "purpose": "The code defines version information, author details, and a function to check for native support by importing a module, with deprecation warning handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statement within the 'native_support()' function and the warnings filter configuration.",
  "sinks": "No data is written to external systems, nor are there untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves attempting to import 'caterpillar._C' when 'native_support()' is called, and setting warning filters, but no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard warning filtering and a module import, with no hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. The import is conditional and inside a try-except block.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes metadata variables, defines a function that conditionally imports a module, and sets warning filters. The import occurs only when 'native_support()' is called, and is wrapped in an exception handler. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code is present. The warning filter is standard for deprecation management. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for feature detection and warning management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It mainly manages support checks and warning configurations.",
