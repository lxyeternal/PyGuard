{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module for version management and support checking, with functions to verify native support and handle warnings.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own version info, author info, and imports from an external module 'caterpillar' inside the 'native_support' function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks for untrusted data. The only external interaction is the import statement within a try-except block.",
  "flows": "The flow involves attempting to import '_C' from 'caterpillar' to determine support, and handling ImportError if it occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behavior are present. The import statement is straightforward, and warning filtering is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script sets metadata variables, defines a support-check function that attempts an import from an external module, and configures warnings. The import is wrapped in a try-except block to handle missing dependencies gracefully. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leakage. The code’s purpose is typical for feature support checking and warning configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily managing support detection and warnings without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any risky operations, contain hidden backdoors, or leak data.",
