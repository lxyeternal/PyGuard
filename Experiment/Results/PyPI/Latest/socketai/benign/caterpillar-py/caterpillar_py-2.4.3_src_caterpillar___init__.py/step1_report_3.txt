{
  "purpose": "Define versioning, author info, and a function to check for native support in the 'caterpillar' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata (__version__, __author__, __release__) and attempts to import 'caterpillar._C'.",
  "sinks": "The import statement could be a potential sink if it triggers malicious code during import, but here it's a standard import attempt.",
  "flows": "From the 'native_support' function, flow from import attempt to the return value indicating support availability.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and exception handling. Warnings filter is standard for deprecation.",
  "analysis": "The script declares metadata, attempts to import a possibly optional module 'caterpillar._C' inside a try-except block, and reports deprecation warnings for the module. The import is contained within a function, with exception handling to avoid failure. There is no evidence of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The import attempt itself is standard for feature detection. The warnings filter is a normal practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard import and warning filtering, and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears to be part of a larger package's support detection and metadata declaration.",
