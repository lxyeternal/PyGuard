{
  "purpose": "The code parses command-line arguments and optionally prints a directory path related to the script location.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed via argparse; os module used to get script directory.",
  "sinks": "Printing output based on argument; no data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Argument parsing (source) leads to a conditional check; if true, os.path.join (sink) executes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs; minor typo in 'argv.include_dir' (should match argument name).",
  "analysis": "The script defines a command-line argument '--include-dir' but checks 'argv.include_dir', which is undefined due to a typo. This prevents the print statement from executing. There are no suspicious or malicious code behaviors, no data leaks, no external communications, and no malicious payloads present. The logic is straightforward and pertains to directory path printing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple argument check and prints a directory path if the argument is provided. There is a typo that prevents the print statement from executing, but no malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
