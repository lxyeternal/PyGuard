{
  "purpose": "The code parses command-line arguments and optionally prints the path to an 'include' directory relative to the script location.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument '--include-dir', reading from 'argv'; os.path functions accessing '__file__' and directory paths.",
  "sinks": "The code only prints output based on the argument; no untrusted data or external data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "User provides '--include-dir' argument -> code checks 'argv.include_dir' -> if true, prints directory path based on '__file__' -> no further data flows or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo: the argument is defined as '--include-dir' but the code checks 'argv.include_dir' (underscore instead of hyphen). This could lead to the condition not functioning as intended, but it is a coding error rather than malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up argument parsing and conditionally outputs a directory path relative to the script's location. It uses standard library functions without any obfuscated code or external network interactions. There are no hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads. The typo in the argument name may cause the condition to not trigger, but it does not introduce security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple argument parsing and directory path output without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The minor typo does not impact security but indicates a possible bug.",
