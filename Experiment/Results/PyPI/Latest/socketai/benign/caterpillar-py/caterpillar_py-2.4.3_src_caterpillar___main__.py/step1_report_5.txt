  "purpose": "The code processes command-line arguments to optionally print a directory path related to the script's location.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument '--include-dir' and the environment variable __file__ for script location.",
  "sinks": "The print function outputs the constructed path, but does not send data elsewhere or to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Parsing command-line argument -> Conditional check -> Construction of path using __file__ -> Printing path.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo: the argument is defined as '--include-dir' but checked as 'argv.include_dir', which will always be False due to mismatched naming. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines an argument parser and adds an argument '--include-dir'. It then parses the command-line arguments into 'argv'. A conditional checks 'argv.include_dir', but since the argument was added as '--include-dir', the attribute is 'argv.include_dir' (with underscore). However, the parser adds it as 'include_dir' by default, matching the check. There are no suspicious data flows or malicious actions. The script simply outputs a directory path if the argument is provided. No malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no external data flows or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility script that prints a directory path when invoked with a specific argument. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The minor naming inconsistency does not introduce vulnerabilities but indicates a possible typo. Overall, it is safe.",
