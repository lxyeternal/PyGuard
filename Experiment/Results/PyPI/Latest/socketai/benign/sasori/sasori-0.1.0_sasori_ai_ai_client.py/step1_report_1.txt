{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract AI client class that formats messages for interaction with an AI system, gathering shared files, prompts, and instructions to prepare messages.",
  "sources": "Data sources include get_shared_files(), get_latest_prompts(), and input parameters like instructions, prompt_files, and final_prompt.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of get_response() (which sends messages to an external AI system) and printing or logging responses and errors via typer.secho.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (shared files, prompts, instructions, final prompt) into message formatting functions, then into get_response() which communicates externally; error handling can output logs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. Use of external functions for file and prompt handling is standard; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code responsibly gathers data from trusted sources and formats them into messages for an AI client. Exception handling logs errors but does not perform unsafe operations. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage. Usage of external functions appears safe and appropriate for intended functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an AI message formatter with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It properly handles data sourcing and formatting, with no suspicious behaviors or security flaws evident.",
