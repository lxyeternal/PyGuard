{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract AI client class that formats messages with shared files, prompts, and instructions for an AI system.",
  "sources": "get_shared_files(), get_latest_prompts(), stringify_file_contents() functions, and the input parameters to send_message() and _format_messages().",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; the messages are prepared for AI response, and no external untrusted data is sent or received in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Shared files, prompts, and instructions are retrieved and formatted into message dictionaries, which are then passed to the get_response() method; no external data flows outside these functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs message objects from retrieved shared files, prompts, instructions, and optional final prompts, then sends these to an abstract get_response() method. It uses external functions to retrieve and process data but does not execute or handle untrusted input in a malicious way. No external data is sent or received over the network, no code injection, and no obfuscated code. Exception handling is standard for error reporting. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of message formatting for an AI client. It relies on external functions for data retrieval but does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.",
