  "purpose": "Define an abstract AI client class that formats messages with shared files, prompts, and instructions, and sends responses using a get_response method.",
  "sources": "get_shared_files(), get_latest_prompts(), stringify_file_contents()",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; message content is composed from trusted sources, and response is returned without further processing or external transmission.",
  "flows": "Shared files, prompts, instructions -> _format_messages -> send_message -> get_response -> return response",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class for an AI client, which formats messages based on instructions, shared files, prompts, and a final prompt. It retrieves shared files and prompts from external functions, which appear to fetch data possibly stored locally or in a database, and uses helper functions to format content. The message assembly process seems straightforward, with no evident malicious payloads. Exception handling is present, and no user data is directly transmitted or stored insecurely. The code relies on external modules for data retrieval but does not show any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured component for an AI client interface, focusing on message formatting and response handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident within this code fragment.",
