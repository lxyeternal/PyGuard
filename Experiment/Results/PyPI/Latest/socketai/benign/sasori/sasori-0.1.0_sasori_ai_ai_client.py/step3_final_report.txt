  "purpose": "Defines an abstract AI client class that formats messages by gathering shared files, prompts, instructions, and optional final prompt, then sends these messages via an abstract response method.",
  "sources": "External functions: get_shared_files(), get_latest_prompts(), stringify_file_contents(), get_instruction_strings()",
  "sinks": "The get_response() method (abstract), logging via typer.secho",
  "flows": "Data flows from external functions into message assembly, then into get_response() call",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unsafe operations detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured message formatter for AI interactions. It relies on external functions for data input, which could be malicious if compromised, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions. Exception handling is standard. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. External dependencies are the primary potential risk vector, but within this snippet, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for preparing messages for an AI client. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. External functions could pose risks if malicious, but the code itself is safe.",
