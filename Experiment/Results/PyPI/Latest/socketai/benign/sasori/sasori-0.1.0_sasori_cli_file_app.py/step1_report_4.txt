  "purpose": "Manage shared-file history through command-line interface commands such as add, remove, clear, list, and undo.",
  "sources": "Function inputs from command-line arguments (paths), and data from get_all_files(), summary_shared_files().",
  "sinks": "append_shared_file(), remove_shared_file(), clear_shared_files(), summary_shared_files(), undo_shared_files() - which interact with shared file data storage.",
  "flows": "User input (paths) → get_all_files() or direct path in remove_shared_file() → data manipulation functions → output or state changes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution or unusual variable usage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides CLI commands for managing shared files, utilizing imported functions for data storage and retrieval. Inputs are command-line arguments, and the functions called do not show internal implementations here. No data leakage, malicious payload, or suspicious behavior is evident. The functions invoked are presumed to perform standard file and state management tasks without malicious intent. No external network communications, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI management tool for shared files with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code. It relies on external functions whose implementations are not shown, but no suspicious activities are evident from the interface and control flow present.",
