  "purpose": "Manage shared-file history through adding, removing, clearing, listing, and undoing file operations.",
  "sources": "get_all_files (reads file system input), user-provided 'path' argument (receives user input)",
  "sinks": "append_shared_file, remove_shared_file, clear_shared_files, summary_shared_files, undo_shared_files (likely interact with data storage or file system)",
  "flows": "User input (path) -> get_all_files -> append_shared_file; User input (path) -> remove_shared_file; User commands -> respective functions -> shared files storage",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. All functions seem to perform standard file management tasks. Exception handling is generic, which is typical for robust error management.",
  "analysis": "The code provides command-line interface commands for managing shared files. It relies on imported functions for actual data handling, with no apparent direct data manipulation or external network interactions. The 'get_all_files' function may read from the filesystem, but without additional context, it appears to be standard. The commands and functions are straightforward, with exception handling that simply reports errors. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present. The code does not perform any network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate file management CLI for shared files with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly interfaces with external functions whose implementations are unknown, but based on this code, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
