  "purpose": "Manage shared-file history with commands to add, remove, clear, list, and undo changes.",
  "sources": "get_all_files function for reading files, remove_shared_file, clear_shared_files, summary_shared_files, undo_shared_files for manipulating shared data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe functions like remove_shared_file, append_shared_file, clear_shared_files, summary_shared_files, undo_shared_files, which interact with shared data.",
  "flows": "Input paths from command arguments flow into get_all_files and remove_shared_file functions; shared data manipulation functions act on shared data; exception handling displays errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of standard library functions and error handling appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code provides CLI commands for managing shared files, calling functions from imported modules to perform actions. No suspicious code, obfuscated features, or malicious behavior detected. It relies on external functions whose security depends on their implementation, but within this code, there are no indicators of malicious intent. No external network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI interface for managing shared file history, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. It functions as intended with standard practices, and no security risks are evident within this module.",
