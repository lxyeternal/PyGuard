  "purpose": "The code provides CLI commands for managing a shared file history, including adding, removing, clearing, listing, and undoing changes.",
  "sources": "get_all_files(path) function and input parameters for file paths in add_file and remove_file functions.",
  "sinks": "append_shared_file, remove_shared_file, clear_shared_files, summary_shared_files, undo_shared_files functions which potentially interact with shared storage or database.",
  "flows": "User input (file paths) -> get_all_files or direct path -> respective shared file functions (append, remove, clear, undo) -> storage or database.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or unusual data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines CLI commands to manipulate shared file history data, relying on external functions for core operations. Input handling via command arguments appears standard. No direct data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. All functions are wrapped with exception handling that outputs errors to the terminal, which is normal behavior. No network calls, file system manipulations beyond the intended shared file management, or other suspicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate CLI utility for managing shared file history with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external, presumably safe, shared file management functions and does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
