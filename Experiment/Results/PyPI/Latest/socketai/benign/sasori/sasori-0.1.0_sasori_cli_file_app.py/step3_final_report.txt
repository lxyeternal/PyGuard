  "purpose": "CLI commands for managing shared files: add, remove, clear, list, undo.",
  "sources": "get_all_files, append_shared_file, remove_shared_file, summary_shared_files, undo_shared_files functions",
  "sinks": "None directly; external functions handle data storage and filesystem interactions",
  "flows": "Input paths or commands → external functions (append, remove, summarize, undo) → system actions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity observed",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward CLI interface for shared file management, relying on external functions presumed to be safe. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are evident. Exception handling is standard, and the code structure is clear. The security implications depend on the external functions' implementation, but within this snippet, no issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on external functions which are outside the scope of this review. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
