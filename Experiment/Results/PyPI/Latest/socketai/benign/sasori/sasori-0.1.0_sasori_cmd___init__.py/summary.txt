  "conclusion": "Overall, the code appears benign with no confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk scores are appropriate given the available information. If dynamic code execution functions are present in the actual code, the malware and risk scores should be increased accordingly. Currently, the assessments are consistent and cautious, appropriately reflecting the limited evidence."
