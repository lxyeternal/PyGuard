{
  "purpose": "The code is a CLI automation tool that interacts with an external AI service to generate or modify code, tests, README, and logs, based on specified instructions and prompt files.",
  "sources": "Files obtained via get_processing_files() or specified directly in prompt_files; external AI responses via get_ai_client().send_message()",
  "sinks": "AI responses processed by parse_code_response() and then written to files using rewrite_files()",
  "flows": "Files are collected, sent to AI with instructions, responses are parsed, and the resulting code/files overwrite existing files",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; reliance on external AI responses introduces operational trust risk",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward automation tasks, leveraging external AI for code generation and modification. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The main security concern is trusting AI responses, which could be malicious if the AI service is compromised. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present within the code itself. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and the external dependency risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe automation script for code maintenance tasks that relies on external AI responses. There is no malicious code or obfuscation within the code. The primary security concern is operational trust in the AI service, not the code itself.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
