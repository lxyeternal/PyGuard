  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a standard Python package component, potentially providing some functionality for a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules; no external input sources such as network, files, or user input are explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, logging, network requests, or data stored in variables, but none are clearly present or misused in the provided code.",
  "flows": "There are no evident untrusted data flows from external sources to sensitive operations within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. There are no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward, with standard function definitions and data processing steps. No suspicious patterns, such as dynamic execution, unusual imports, or malicious payloads, are detected. No malicious side-effects or privacy violations are evident. Overall, the code seems benign and consistent with typical open-source packages.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured component without suspicious elements.",
