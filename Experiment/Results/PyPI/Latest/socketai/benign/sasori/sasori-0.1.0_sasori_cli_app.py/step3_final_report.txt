  "purpose": "CLI utility for managing prompts, files, clipboard interactions, and communicating with an external AI client.",
  "sources": "Clipboard read/write functions, external AI client via get_ai_client().send_message(), prompt and file management functions.",
  "sinks": "Clipboard output, external AI client network communication, console output.",
  "flows": "Clipboard data flows from user/system to clipboard functions, prompts are appended and cleared, and messages are sent to the AI client, potentially over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, exception handling is standard, and no malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI application managing prompts, files, and clipboard interactions, with external communication via an AI client. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. Exception handling for clipboard access is appropriate. The external AI client interaction could involve network activity, but without evidence of malicious intent, it is considered standard. All functions and modules used are typical for such applications, and no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects the external communication component, which is typical for AI-related tools. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
