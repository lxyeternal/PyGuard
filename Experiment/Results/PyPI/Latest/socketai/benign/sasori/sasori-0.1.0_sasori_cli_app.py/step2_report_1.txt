  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes prompt management, clipboard, and external AI communication.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation, and no hardcoded secrets.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, straightforward CLI.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable.  \n**Justification:** The report's reasoning is sound; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The slight risk score accounts for external AI communication, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar accurate description.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, standard exception handling.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appears safe.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are appropriate.  \n**Justification:** No malicious patterns or suspicious external calls are evident. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly describes the code's function.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard modules.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe CLI utility.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem justified.  \n**Justification:** No signs of malicious activity; the small risk accounts for network interaction via AI client.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, standard clipboard handling, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign CLI tool.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are reasonable.  \n**Justification:** No malicious activity detected; standard operations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly notes clipboard and AI interaction.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, standard exception handling.  \n- **Conclusion:** Likely benign.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.  \n**Justification:** The only potential concern is network activity via `get_ai_client().send_message()`, but without evidence of malicious intent, the low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's content. No malicious payload, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, justified by external communication with an AI service. No high-risk behaviors are detected.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to external API calls, which are standard for such applications.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The minor risk score reflects the external communication aspect, which is typical for AI-related tools.**",
