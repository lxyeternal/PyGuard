{
  "purpose": "This script defines a command-line interface (CLI) for managing prompts, files, and clipboard interactions for an AI application, with functionalities like adding prompts, clearing data, and previewing summaries.",
  "sources": "Clipboard input via pyperclip.paste(), user input prompts, and data retrieval functions such as summary_prompts(), summary_shared_files(), and summary_processing_files().",
  "sinks": "Clipboard output via pyperclip.copy(), printing responses and summaries to the console, and calling external AI client methods like get_ai_client().send_message().",
  "flows": "User inputs prompts or commands -> functions process input or retrieve data -> data may be copied to clipboard or printed -> AI client interactions for responses.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. Use of try-except for clipboard operations is standard. No suspicious external domain connections, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic. The code structure appears conventional for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code provides CLI commands for prompt management, clipboard operations, and AI interactions. All external functions (like get_ai_client and summary functions) seem to handle data securely without evident malicious intent. Clipboard functions handle exceptions properly, avoiding potential crashes. The AI client interaction is limited to sending a message and printing the response, with no evidence of data exfiltration or malicious commands. Overall, the code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI interface for managing prompts and interacting with an AI client. It does not contain malicious code or suspicious behaviors. It appears safe based on the provided snippet.",
