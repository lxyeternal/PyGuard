{
  "purpose": "The code provides a CLI tool for managing prompts, files, and system interactions such as clipboard operations, with some integration for AI client messaging.",
  "sources": "Clipboard data (via pyperclip.paste()), user input prompts, imported modules for database and AI interactions.",
  "sinks": "Clipboard copy (pyperclip.copy()), console output (typer.secho, print), calling external AI client (get_ai_client().send_message())",
  "flows": "Clipboard data read -> appended as prompt or displayed; user inputs prompts -> stored in database; AI client message request -> response printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns. Use of external modules (pyperclip, AI client) appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script manages prompts and files via a CLI, with functions for clipboard operations, prompt management, and AI messaging. All interactions are straightforward and involve common modules. Clipboard functions include exception handling. No data leaks, no suspicious external calls, or hidden behaviors are present. The AI client call is an external API interaction, but without specifics, it appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI utility for managing prompts and files with clipboard support and AI interaction. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code fragment.",
