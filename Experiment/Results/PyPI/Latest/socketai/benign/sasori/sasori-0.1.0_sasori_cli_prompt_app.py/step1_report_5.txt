{
  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface for managing prompt history, including adding, removing, clearing, listing, and undoing prompts.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from command-line arguments (prompt parameter in add and remove commands) and internally from the functions called (append_prompt, remove_prompt, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the functions append_prompt, remove_prompt, clear_prompts, summary_prompts, and undo_prompts, which may process or store the prompt data.",
  "flows": "Input prompts from command-line arguments flow into the respective functions (e.g., append_prompt, remove_prompt). The functions likely handle data storage or retrieval, with no external untrusted data processing evident within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hard-coded secrets are present. Exception handling prints error messages but does not process untrusted data insecurely.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a wrapper for prompt management functions imported from 'sasori.db.prompt_db'. It uses the Typer library to provide CLI commands. There is no evidence of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior within this snippet. It primarily passes user input to functions that presumably handle data storage. Without access to the implementation of these functions, no malicious activity can be inferred. The overall structure is standard, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI interface for managing prompt history, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet.",
