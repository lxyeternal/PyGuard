  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the accuracy of their conclusions, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any security concerns are overlooked.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It provides a CLI for managing prompt history: add, remove, clear, list, undo.\n- It relies on external functions from `sasori.db.prompt_db`.\n- It uses standard exception handling and user feedback.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident within this snippet.\n- The security of the database functions depends on their implementation, which is not provided.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Purpose and Source Analysis**\nAll reports agree on the purpose: CLI for prompt management, sourcing data from user input and external database functions. No issues here.\n\n### 2. **Sink and Flow Analysis**\n- Data flows from user input into database functions.\n- No evidence of untrusted data execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.\n\n### 3. **Anomalies and Suspicious Patterns**\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- Exception handling is standard.\n- The external functions' security is unknown, but the code itself appears straightforward.\n\n### 4. **Malware and Security Risk Scores**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), which seems reasonable given the context.\n\n### 5. **Potential Flaws or Overestimations**\n- Since the core database functions are external, their security cannot be assessed here. However, the reports correctly state that the code itself appears safe.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Challenging Assumptions and Claims**\n- The reports assume the external database functions are secure. This is reasonable but should be noted as a dependency.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis is cautious and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Overall Assessment and Personal Score Estimation**\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- All reports agree on 0; this is appropriate. No malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- All reports give 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- Given the code's simplicity and reliance on external functions, a low risk score (~0.1–0.2) is justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (assuming external functions are secure and trustworthy)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes:**\n- The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The security posture heavily depends on the external functions (`append_prompt`, etc.), which are not part of this snippet.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. I concur with their assessments and scores, and I would assign the following scores:\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1             |\n\nThe code appears safe and non-malicious, with minimal security risk assuming external dependencies are secure.",
