  "purpose": "Manage AI prompt history with add, remove, clear, list, and undo operations.",
  "sources": "Importing functions from sasori.db.prompt_db; command argument inputs for prompt text.",
  "sinks": "append_prompt, remove_prompt, clear_prompts, summary_prompts, undo_prompts functions; exception handling outputs.",
  "flows": "Input prompts are passed to database functions; exception handling outputs errors; summary is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Usage appears straightforward. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CLI interface for managing prompts, relying on external functions from sasori.db.prompt_db. No user input is directly executed as code. The database functions are assumed to handle data securely. No suspicious network activity, file manipulations, or hidden behaviors are evident. Exception handling only outputs error messages. No anomalous or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper for prompt management, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It relies on external database functions that are assumed to be secure. No malware, backdoors, or security risks are detected based on this code segment.",
