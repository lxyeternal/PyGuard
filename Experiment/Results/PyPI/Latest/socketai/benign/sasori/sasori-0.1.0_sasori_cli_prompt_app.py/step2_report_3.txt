  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around imported database functions.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.\n- Exception handling is standard and only outputs error messages.\n- The actual security or maliciousness heavily depends on the external functions (`append_prompt`, `remove_prompt`, etc.), which are not provided.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or data exfiltration signs are evident.\n- The code is not obfuscated, and no unusual patterns are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No issues** are present in the code snippet itself. It is a typical CLI interface.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **No significant errors** are apparent in the reasoning of the reports.\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a CLI wrapper with external database functions.\n- They uniformly conclude that the code appears safe and free of malicious behavior.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate given the code does not perform any malicious actions directly.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity and reliance on external functions.\n\n**However,** the security risk score could be slightly higher if the external functions are untrusted, but since we lack their implementation, the conservative approach is to keep it low.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The code is a standard CLI wrapper.\n- The external functions' security cannot be assessed here, but that alone does not elevate the risk unless malicious code is embedded there.\n\n**Therefore, the current scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.**\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, based on the code snippet)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, straightforward CLI interface for managing prompts, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks within this snippet. The external database functions are a potential vector if malicious, but cannot be assessed here.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (since the code itself is safe; external functions could be risky but are outside this scope)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Continue to monitor the external functions (`append_prompt`, etc.) for security issues, as they are the actual sinks where malicious behavior could occur.",
