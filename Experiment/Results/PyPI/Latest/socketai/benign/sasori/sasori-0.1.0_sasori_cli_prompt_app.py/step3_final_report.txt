  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands for managing prompt history, including add, remove, clear, list, and undo functionalities, via Typer.",
  "sources": "User input prompts and external functions from sasori.db.prompt_db (append_prompt, remove_prompt, clear_prompts, summary_prompts, undo_prompts).",
  "sinks": "External database functions that handle prompt data; no direct sinks within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "User inputs are passed to external functions; no untrusted data flows within this code itself.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around external database functions for prompt management. It employs standard exception handling and user feedback. No malicious code, obfuscation, or insecure practices are evident. The security of the system depends on the trustworthiness of the external functions, which are not provided. The code does not perform network activity or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard CLI interface for prompt management with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, assuming external functions are secure. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
