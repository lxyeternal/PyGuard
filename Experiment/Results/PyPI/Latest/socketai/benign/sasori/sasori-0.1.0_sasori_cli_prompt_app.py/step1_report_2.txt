  "purpose": "Manage AI prompt history through add, remove, clear, list, and undo operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'sasori.db.prompt_db' functions (append_prompt, remove_prompt, clear_prompts, summary_prompts, undo_prompts); user input prompts via command line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Data passed to database functions (append_prompt, remove_prompt, etc.) which may handle or store prompt data.",
  "flows": "User input prompts -> command functions -> database functions (e.g., append_prompt) -> storage or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments. The code relies on external database functions; without their implementation, potential risks can't be fully assessed, but the current code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines CLI commands for managing prompt history, passing user-supplied prompt data to database functions. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present in this snippet. Exception handling merely logs errors without exposing sensitive data or executing unsafe operations. The database functions' internal implementation is not shown; assuming they are standard database operations, there is no indication of malicious intent here. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observable.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI interface for prompt management with no evident malicious behavior or security risks within the provided scope. It appears safe, assuming the database functions are secure and trustworthy.",
