  "purpose": "CLI utility for managing processing-file history through commands: add, remove, clear, list, undo.",
  "sources": "get_all_files() for retrieving files; imported functions for database/file operations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions operate on files and database entries, not executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "User input (paths) -> get_all_files() -> processing functions (append/remove/etc.) -> database/file storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper invoking external functions for file management. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The functions' internal implementations are unknown but presumed standard. The use of get_all_files() and the invoked functions does not suggest malicious intent. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, benign CLI utility managing processing files. No malicious or sabotage activity is detected. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
