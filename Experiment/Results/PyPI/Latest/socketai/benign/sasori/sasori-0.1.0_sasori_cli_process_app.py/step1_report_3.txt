  "purpose": "Manage processing-file history by adding, removing, clearing, listing, and undoing file operations.",
  "sources": "get_all_files() function reading directory contents; command-line arguments providing file paths.",
  "sinks": "append_processing_file(), remove_processing_file(), clear_processing_files(), summary_processing_files(), undo_processing_files() functions which perform file operations.",
  "flows": "Input paths from command-line -> get_all_files() -> processing functions (add/remove) -> possibly alter database or file state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. Usage appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script provides CLI commands to manage a processing file list, utilizing external functions for actual data handling. No sensitive information handling, no network activity, no code injection, and no suspicious behavior detected. All functions appear to perform expected file list management tasks. The functions used are imported from other modules, but their usage here is straightforward and benign. No anomalies or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard command-line interface for managing a file processing history with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks.",
