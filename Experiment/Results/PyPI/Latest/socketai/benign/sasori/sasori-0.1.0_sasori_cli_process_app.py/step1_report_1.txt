  "purpose": "Manage processing-file history through adding, removing, clearing, listing, and undoing file operations.",
  "sources": "get_all_files() function to read files from a specified path, user input arguments for file paths.",
  "sinks": "append_processing_file, remove_processing_file, clear_processing_files, summary_processing_files, undo_processing_files functions, which may modify or access file processing history.",
  "flows": "User provides a path -> get_all_files() retrieves files -> respective functions (append, remove, etc.) process files -> updates history.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code. Functions appear to perform standard file processing tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CLI app using Typer with commands to manipulate a processing-file history. It relies on imported functions from sasori.db.process_file_db and sasori.util.file_util. The commands operate on files obtained via get_all_files(), which may read multiple files from a directory. The functions invoked are typical for managing a file queue or history, such as append, remove, clear, list, and undo. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior within this code snippet. The functions and imports seem to be standard for a file management utility. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, and no dynamic code execution are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate file management CLI tool without malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet. It performs expected file processing operations without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
