  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a tkinter GUI application with dynamic widget creation.\n- No network activity, file operations, or external system calls are present.\n- User inputs are retrieved via `get()` methods and used to update widget properties via `configure()`.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are identified.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, are evident.\n- The code is straightforward, primarily for GUI interaction and layout management.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues:\n- **Issues are not present** in the code. The code appears safe and standard for a GUI app.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only minor flaw is a typo in the method name `__window()` which is documented as \"craer\" (probably intended as \"crear\" or \"create\"). But this is a minor typo and does not impact security.\n- No logical flaws that could lead to security issues are identified.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`. Correct, as code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- Since there is no malicious activity, the malware score remains at 0.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, as the code is clear.\n- The risk score is low, reflecting the benign GUI code.\n\n### Consistency check:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.\n- No claims are based on assumptions; all findings are factual.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven all the above, I will assign the following scores:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\nThe very low risk score (0.1) accounts for the minimal chance of accidental misuse or minor issues, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **The code is a benign, straightforward GUI application.**\n- **No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.**\n- **Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.**\n\n**Final recommendation:** The supply chain security risk for this dependency is negligible.",
