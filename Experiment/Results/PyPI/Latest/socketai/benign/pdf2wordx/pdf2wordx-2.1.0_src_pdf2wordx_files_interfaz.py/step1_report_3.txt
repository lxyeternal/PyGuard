  "purpose": "Create a GUI application using Tkinter with customizable widgets and layout.",
  "sources": "Tkinter widget creation and configuration, user input retrieval via get() methods.",
  "sinks": "Configuration of widgets, especially calling get() on Entry widgets, and configuring commands for buttons.",
  "flows": "Widget creation -> user input retrieval (get) -> widget configuration (configure) -> command execution (click function).",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda in command to invoke click with getText(2); no evidence of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a Tkinter window with buttons, labels, and entries, allowing user interaction. It uses standard practices for widget creation, layout, and event handling. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors detected. No external network activity or system manipulation present. The get() calls on Entry widgets are typical for capturing user input. The code appears to be a straightforward GUI app with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign GUI application designed for user interaction with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
