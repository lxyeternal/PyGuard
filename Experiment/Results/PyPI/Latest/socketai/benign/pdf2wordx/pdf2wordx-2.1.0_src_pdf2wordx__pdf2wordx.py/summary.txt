  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured GUI application for PDF to Word conversion with no evidence of malicious or sabotage activity. The low malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score of 0.2 reflects minimal concern, primarily due to reliance on external modules and user input handling, which are standard in such applications."
