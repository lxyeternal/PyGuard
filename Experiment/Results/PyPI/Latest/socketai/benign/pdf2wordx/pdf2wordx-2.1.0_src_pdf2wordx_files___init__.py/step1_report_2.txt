{
  "purpose": "Import modules 'interfaz' and 'functions' from the current package for internal use.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports from the local package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform operations that could leak data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; imports are static references to internal modules.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements with no additional logic, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements, which are standard in Python packages. There are no indications of data input, output, or execution of untrusted code. The minimal structure suggests it is part of a larger module setup. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a benign part of a package setup.",
