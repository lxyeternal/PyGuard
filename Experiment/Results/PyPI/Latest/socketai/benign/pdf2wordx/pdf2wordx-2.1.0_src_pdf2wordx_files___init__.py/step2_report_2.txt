  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of two import statements:\n     ```python\n     from . import interfaz\n     from . import functions\n     ```\n   - These are standard relative imports in Python packages.\n   - There are no signs of data processing, external communication, or any other potentially malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code snippet.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a security risk of 0, and the code is merely importing local modules, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The code does not execute untrusted code, handle user input, or perform any network operations.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This is appropriate; the code does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n   - No hidden payloads or obfuscated code are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward analysis.\n   - There are no unwarranted assumptions; the assessments are consistent with the code snippet.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code snippet is entirely benign, standard Python package import statements. There are no security issues, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align perfectly with the existing reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
