  "purpose": "Import local modules 'interfaz' and 'functions' for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks present; no untrusted data handling or external connections.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data from sources to sinks; only module imports.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, simple import statements; no anomalies or suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two relative import statements, which are common in Python packages for importing internal modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No external data sources, environment variables, or untrusted inputs are involved. The imports do not execute code or contain embedded payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import of internal modules with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be standard package initialization code.",
