  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom . import interfaz\nfrom . import functions\n```\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code performs only two relative import statements from local modules.\n- There are no data flows, user inputs, external communications, or dynamic code execution.\n- The imports are standard in Python packages and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or anomalies are present.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Correctly identifies that the code is benign, with no suspicious activity.  \n   - Confidence is high; no issues.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Same conclusion; straightforward import statements, no security risk.  \n   - No reason to adjust the score.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Consistent with previous assessments; no anomalies or malicious behavior.  \n   - Scores seem appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Also accurate; minimal, standard import statements.  \n   - No concerns.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Same reasoning; benign package setup code.  \n   - Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty about benign nature.\n- No inconsistencies or unreasonable scores are evident.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The code snippet is very simple; it cannot be malicious or obfuscated.\n- The only potential concern could be if these imports are part of a larger malicious package, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- No changes needed. The code is safe and standard.\n- Continue monitoring larger code context if available, but based on this snippet, no issues are present.",
