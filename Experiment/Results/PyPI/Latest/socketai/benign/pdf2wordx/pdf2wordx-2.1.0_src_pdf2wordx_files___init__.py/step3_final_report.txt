{
  "purpose": "The code performs relative imports of local modules 'interfaz' and 'functions' within a Python package, serving as part of package setup or internal referencing.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing local modules 'interfaz' and 'functions' via relative import syntax.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external communications, or data sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules without any data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs; no data flows to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two standard relative import statements, which are typical in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or security issues. The code is minimal and straightforward, with high confidence that it is benign. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, representing standard package import statements with no security risks or malicious intent. The existing reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
