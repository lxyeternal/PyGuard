  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The original code only contains two import statements:\n     ```python\n     from . import interfaz\n     from . import functions\n     ```\n   - There are no signs of malicious activity, data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n   - All reports correctly identify that these are standard relative imports within a package.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or security issues.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since all reports and the code itself indicate no malicious activity, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - A high risk score would be unjustified here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the benign assessment.\n   - No malicious behavior is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All claims are based on the code snippet provided.\n   - There are no assumptions about external factors or hidden behaviors; the analysis is straightforward.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is purely composed of standard import statements for local modules.\n- There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the code's benign nature.",
