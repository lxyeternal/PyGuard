{
  "purpose": "This code imports a local module '_pdf2wordx' and executes its 'run' function, likely related to PDF to Word conversion.",
  "sources": "The import statement indicates reading the local module '_pdf2wordx'. No external data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this snippet; it only imports a module.",
  "flows": "The code imports the module; no data flow or execution beyond this point is shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a local module, which is syntactically correct and typical in Python projects. Without the content of '_pdf2wordx', no further security assessment can be made. The snippet does not demonstrate malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence in benignity is high given the simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a standard import statement. There is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk is minimal, contingent on the content of the imported module, which cannot be assessed here.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
