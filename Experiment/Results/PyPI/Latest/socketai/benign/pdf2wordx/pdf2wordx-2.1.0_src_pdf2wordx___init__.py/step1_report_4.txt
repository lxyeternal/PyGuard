  "purpose": "Importing the 'run' function from a local module '_pdf2wordx' for PDF to Word conversion or processing.",
  "sources": "The import statement indicates reading the '_pdf2wordx' module from the local package or directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this single line of code; no data is being processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "There is no data flow; only an import statement is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are visible. The module name '_pdf2wordx' is not inherently suspicious but could warrant further review if more code is provided.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a single function 'run' from a local module '_pdf2wordx'. As it only involves an import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity at this stage. Without additional code, it is not possible to identify malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evident malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. Further context would be needed to assess the behavior of the 'run' function or the module.",
