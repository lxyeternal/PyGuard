  "purpose": "Utility functions for XML parsing, number formatting, HTML decoding, date formatting, and YouTube URL parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hardcoded example URLs for YouTube videos.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data output from untrusted sources or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input URLs are processed within parse_youtube_url function to extract video IDs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The URL parsing is straightforward without obfuscation. The only data processing is extraction of video IDs from URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions without external data sources or sinks. The example URLs are hardcoded test data, not user input or external input. The functions perform string parsing, date formatting, and HTML decoding, all in a safe manner. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe utility script with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, malicious data flows, or security vulnerabilities. The example URLs are benign and used solely for demonstration.",
