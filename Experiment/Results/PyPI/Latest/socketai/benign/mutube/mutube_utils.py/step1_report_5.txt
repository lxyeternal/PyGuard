  "purpose": "Utility functions for data parsing and formatting, including XML to JSON conversion, number formatting, HTML decoding, date formatting, and YouTube URL parsing.",
  "sources": "Input sources are the YouTube URLs passed to parse_youtube_url function. Data is read from string literals and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The only output is the printed video IDs extracted from URLs.",
  "flows": "URLs are processed in parse_youtube_url, which splits the URL string to extract video IDs, then printed. No further data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. The URL parsing is straightforward and limited to string splitting.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily provides utility functions for parsing and formatting. The parse_youtube_url function extracts video IDs based on URL patterns. No untrusted data sources or unsafe code are present. The code does not execute external commands, handle sensitive data, or perform network operations beyond printing parsed IDs. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for parsing URLs and formatting data. No malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
