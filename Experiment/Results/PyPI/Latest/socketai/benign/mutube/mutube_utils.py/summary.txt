  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main consideration is proper error handling for untrusted URLs, but this does not elevate security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk due to untrusted input processing."
