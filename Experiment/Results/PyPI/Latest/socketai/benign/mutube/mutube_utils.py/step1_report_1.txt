  "purpose": "Utility functions for XML parsing, number formatting, HTML decoding, date formatting, and extracting YouTube video IDs from URLs.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the 'xml' parameter in convert_xml_to_json and 'url' parameter in parse_youtube_url.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the return values from parse_youtube_url which could be used maliciously if input URLs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Untrusted URL input flows into parse_youtube_url, which extracts and returns the video ID; no other data flows involve untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The parse_youtube_url function does not handle invalid URLs gracefully; it raises exceptions. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions performing parsing and formatting tasks. The parse_youtube_url function extracts video IDs based on string patterns, which could be exploited if untrusted URLs are used maliciously. However, it only parses strings and raises exceptions on invalid formats; no malicious code or suspicious behavior is present. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are found. Usage of external libraries is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily utility functions with no malicious intent. The only potential concern is the handling of untrusted input URLs in parse_youtube_url, which could cause runtime errors but does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall security risk is low.",
