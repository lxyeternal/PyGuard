  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing XML, formatting numbers/dates, decoding HTML entities, and extracting YouTube video IDs from URLs.",
  "sources": "Untrusted URL input in parse_youtube_url function",
  "sinks": "Return value of parse_youtube_url, which outputs extracted video IDs",
  "flows": "Untrusted URL passed into parse_youtube_url, which processes and extracts video ID",
  "anomalies": "Raises exceptions on malformed URLs without handling; no malicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code comprises straightforward utility functions with no network activity or malicious payloads. The URL parsing function extracts video IDs based on URL patterns and raises exceptions for invalid URLs, which could cause runtime errors but does not constitute malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The overall behavior is benign, with low security risk primarily related to untrusted input handling, which is a common and manageable concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main consideration is proper error handling for untrusted URLs, but this does not elevate security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk due to untrusted input processing.",
