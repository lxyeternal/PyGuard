  "purpose": "Manage storage and retrieval of YouTube API key in a local configuration file.",
  "sources": "Reading the config.json file from the user's home directory; reading input data via function parameter in set_api_key.",
  "sinks": "Writing the updated config dictionary to config.json file; reading from config.json file.",
  "flows": "set_api_key receives api_key → updates config dictionary → writes to config.json; get_api_key reads from config.json to retrieve API key.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no unusual code patterns; standard file I/O operations; straightforward JSON handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to get and set an API key stored in a JSON configuration file located in the user's home directory. It performs standard file existence checks, reads, and writes without any data sanitization or handling of untrusted input beyond the function parameter. There are no suspicious data leaks, network activity, or obfuscated behaviors. No embedded malicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code does not perform any unsafe operations, external communications, or secret exfiltration. It is a simple configuration management implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration handler for API keys with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It manages local data securely and simply, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
