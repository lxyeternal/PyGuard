  "purpose": "Manage a JSON configuration file for storing and retrieving a YouTube API key in the user's home directory.",
  "sources": "Reading the config.json file, loading JSON data, and accessing the 'youtube_api_key' key.",
  "sinks": "Returning the API key; writing updated config data back to config.json.",
  "flows": "get_api_key reads from config.json; set_api_key reads existing config, updates 'youtube_api_key', and writes back to config.json.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward file I/O and JSON handling with no suspicious or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration management: checking file existence, reading/writing JSON, and updating a key. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious behaviors are present. The API key is stored in plain text, which is typical for local configs but could be a security concern if environment is compromised. No external network activity or code injection detected. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration handler with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The low security risk score is justified by the plain text storage of sensitive data, which is common in local configuration files. All reports correctly assess the benign nature and assign appropriate scores.",
