  "purpose": "Manage and retrieve YouTube API key stored in a local JSON configuration file",
  "sources": "Reading the config.json file from the user's home directory; Reading user-provided API key parameter in set_api_key()",
  "sinks": "Writing to the config.json file in the user's home directory",
  "flows": "get_api_key() reads data from config.json; set_api_key() writes data to config.json",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of untrusted input other than provided API key parameter; no obfuscation or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to read and write a configuration file storing a YouTube API key. It uses standard library functions to handle file paths and JSON data. No external network connections or processing of untrusted data beyond storing and retrieving the API key. The API key is not hardcoded; it is stored and retrieved securely within the user directory. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and standard for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic configuration file management for a YouTube API key without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate, benign utility for handling API keys locally.",
