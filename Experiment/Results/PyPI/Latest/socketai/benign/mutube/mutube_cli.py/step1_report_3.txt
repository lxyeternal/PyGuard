{
  "purpose": "This code is a command-line tool for analyzing YouTube video statistics and displaying them in a formatted table.",
  "sources": "Input is obtained from command-line arguments (api_key, url). Data is read via functions like parse_youtube_url and initialize_youtube_client, and from the find_nearby_videos function which likely fetches data from YouTube's API.",
  "sinks": "Output is printed to the console via rich.Table and console.print. API keys are set through set_api_key, which may store sensitive data.",
  "flows": "API key provided via command line -> set_api_key stores key -> analyze retrieves video ID -> initialize_youtube_client uses stored key -> find_nearby_videos fetches data -> display via rich.Table",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present. Usage of API keys appears to be managed via set_api_key, but no evidence of insecure handling or leakage.",
  "analysis": "The script defines CLI commands to set an API key and analyze YouTube videos. It uses standard libraries and calls functions from local modules for processing. The code retrieves data from YouTube, sorts videos, and displays information. No suspicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. The only potential concern is how set_api_key stores the API key, but this is external to the code provided. Overall, the code appears to implement legitimate functionality without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate YouTube analytics CLI tool with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It handles user input and API interactions in a typical manner. No security risks or anomalies are identified based on the provided code.",
