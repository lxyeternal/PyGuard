  "purpose": "Command-line tool for analyzing YouTube videos and their view counts relative to similar videos.",
  "sources": "parse_youtube_url (input URL), API key setting via set_api_key, initialize_youtube_client (used to get YouTube API client), find_nearby_videos (fetches video data).",
  "sinks": "API key usage in initialize_youtube_client, data processing from find_nearby_videos, console.print (outputs table).",
  "flows": "Input URL -> parse_youtube_url -> initialize_youtube_client -> find_nearby_videos -> data sorting and processing -> console.print(table).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. No network connections outside expected API calls. No unusual data handling.",
  "analysis": "The script is a CLI utility that allows setting an API key and analyzing YouTube videos. The code primarily calls external functions (initialize_youtube_client, find_nearby_videos, parse_youtube_url, set_api_key), which are imported from other modules. The main logic involves sorting video data and displaying it in a formatted table. No sensitive data is hardcoded, and no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoor access is detected within this code. All data flows are limited to expected API interactions and output display. The code structure is standard and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI tool for YouTube video analysis. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this module. It relies on external modules for core functions, but nothing suspicious is apparent from this code segment.",
