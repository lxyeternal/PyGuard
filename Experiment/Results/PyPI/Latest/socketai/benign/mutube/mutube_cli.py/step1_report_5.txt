{
  "purpose": "The code is a command-line tool for analyzing YouTube videos, fetching data via the YouTube Data API, and displaying analytics in a formatted table.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line arguments ('api_key' and 'url'), data parsed from YouTube URLs, and potentially from the 'find_nearby_videos' function.",
  "sinks": "API key setting, data retrieval from YouTube API, and data output to console. No data is transmitted over the network beyond API calls; no sensitive data is stored or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "User inputs API key and video URL -> API key set and stored internally -> Video URL parsed -> YouTube client initialized -> Nearby videos fetched -> Data processed and displayed in console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No obfuscated code, hidden data leaks, or malicious code patterns are detected. Use of third-party libraries is standard for CLI tools and data display.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up CLI commands, processes user inputs, fetches YouTube data, and displays it. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are present. The API key is set through a command argument and used internally. External API calls are standard for this purpose. The logic appears consistent with intended functionality, and there are no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate YouTube analytics CLI tool with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It properly handles inputs and outputs data without suspicious behaviors. Overall, it appears safe and free of malware.",
