  "purpose": "A CLI tool for analyzing YouTube videos by fetching related videos and displaying view counts and metadata.",
  "sources": "External functions: initialize_youtube_client, find_nearby_videos, parse_youtube_url, set_api_key",
  "sinks": "Display of data via console.print; external API interactions",
  "flows": "User inputs URL/API key -> external API calls -> data processing -> table display",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility relying on external modules for core functionality. It performs standard operations: setting API keys, parsing URLs, fetching related videos, sorting, and displaying data in a table. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious data handling are present. The scores from reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, transparent nature of the code. External dependencies and API key handling are typical and do not raise security concerns. The overall structure and data flow are standard for such tools, with no anomalies or indicators of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard YouTube analytics CLI tool with no malicious intent or security issues. The external dependencies and data handling are typical, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's transparency and functionality.",
