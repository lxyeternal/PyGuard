  "purpose": "A command-line tool for analyzing YouTube video view counts relative to similar videos, utilizing YouTube Data API.",
  "sources": "Input is taken from command-line arguments (API key and URL), and data is fetched via API client initialization and URL parsing.",
  "sinks": "API calls (initialize_youtube_client, find_nearby_videos), console output (console.print).",
  "flows": "User provides API key and video URL -> set_api_key stores API key -> parse_youtube_url extracts video ID -> initialize_youtube_client creates API client -> find_nearby_videos fetches related videos -> data processed and displayed in table.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network connections or backdoors observed. External dependencies (rich, click) are standard. No malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical CLI application utilizing standard libraries and modules for YouTube API interaction and data presentation. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious data flows. The API key is set via command-line argument and stored through a setter function, which appears standard. The data flow from user input to API calls and output display is straightforward. No anomalies or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign command-line tool for YouTube video analysis. It does not contain malicious code, suspicious network activity, or security vulnerabilities. All data handling and API interactions seem standard and safe.",
