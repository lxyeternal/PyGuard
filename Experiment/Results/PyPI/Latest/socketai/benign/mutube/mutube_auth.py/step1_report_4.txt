  "flows": "get_api_key() -> discovery.build() with developerKey parameter.",
  "anomalies": "The code disables HTTPS verification with OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT='1', which is insecure for production. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, sets an environment variable to disable HTTPS verification (not recommended outside of local testing), retrieves an API key via get_api_key(), and uses Google's discovery library to build a YouTube API client. The API key is obtained from a separate config module, not hardcoded. The disabling of HTTPS verification is flagged as insecure for production use but is explicitly noted as a local testing measure. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code performs standard initialization for a Google API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API client initialization script with a note on insecure environment variable usage for local testing. No malicious behavior or supply chain security risks identified. The only concern is the insecure environment setting which should be removed in production.",
