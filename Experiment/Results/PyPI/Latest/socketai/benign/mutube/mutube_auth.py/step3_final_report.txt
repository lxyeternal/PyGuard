  "purpose": "Initialize a YouTube API client using an API key retrieved from a local configuration, with environment setup for local testing.",
  "sources": "get_api_key() function call for API key; environment variable 'OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT' set to '1'; discovery.build() with developerKey.",
  "sinks": "discovery.build() initializes the client; environment variable affects HTTPS verification; no data leaks or external connections observed.",
  "flows": "get_api_key() provides API key -> environment variable disables HTTPS verification -> discovery.build() creates client instance.",
  "anomalies": "Setting 'OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT' to '1' disables HTTPS verification, which is insecure outside local testing environments.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly initializes a YouTube API client with an API key, explicitly disabling HTTPS verification for local testing. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The insecure environment variable is a known development practice and should be removed in production. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious client initialization with a development-only insecure setting. No malware or obfuscation detected. The security risk is low and primarily due to the environment variable, which should be disabled in production. The scores and assessments are consistent and accurate.",
