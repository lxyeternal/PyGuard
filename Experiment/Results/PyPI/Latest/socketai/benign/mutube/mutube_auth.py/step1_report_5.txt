  "purpose": "Initialize a YouTube API client using an API key retrieved from a configuration module.",
  "sources": "get_api_key() function call from .config module, environment variable OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT, and API key used in discovery.build.",
  "sinks": "discovery.build() using developerKey, and environment variable setting OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT.",
  "flows": "get_api_key() provides the API key to discovery.build(). Environment variable set affects OAuthlib's HTTPS verification.",
  "anomalies": "Setting OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=1 disables HTTPS verification, which is insecure for production environments. No other suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves an API key via get_api_key() and uses it to initialize a YouTube client. It temporarily disables HTTPS verification for OAuthlib, which is flagged as insecure but explicitly noted as a development setting. The API key is obtained from a local configuration, which is a common pattern. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected. No suspicious network activity or backdoors evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform a standard setup for a YouTube API client, with a known insecure setting for local development only. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this code fragment.",
