{
  "purpose": "Initialize a YouTube API client using an API key and configure environment variables for development.",
  "sources": "The code reads the API key from a function get_api_key() and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "The API key is used in discovery.build() to create the YouTube client.",
  "flows": "get_api_key() → discovery.build() using the developerKey parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior. The environment variable is set insecurely only for local development, with a clear comment that it should not be used in production.",
  "analysis": "The code sets an environment variable to disable HTTPS verification for OAuthlib, which is a common practice in local testing but insecure for production. It retrieves an API key via get_api_key(), which is expected to be a controlled function. The API key is used to build a YouTube client via Google's discovery API, with proper parameter passing. No hardcoded credentials are present, and the code does not perform any malicious actions or data exfiltration. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for initializing a YouTube API client with development considerations. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks beyond the noted insecure environment variable setting intended solely for local testing.",
