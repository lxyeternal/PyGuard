  "purpose": "Initialize and configure a YouTube API client using an API key obtained from a separate configuration module.",
  "sources": "get_api_key() function call, environment variable setting (os.environ['OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT'])",
  "sinks": "discovery.build() function call with developerKey parameter, environment variable setting",
  "flows": "get_api_key() provides API key from external source -> used in discovery.build() to initialize YouTube client",
  "anomalies": "Disabling OAuthlib's HTTPS verification with environment variable 'OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT' set to '1' in the code, which is insecure for production environments; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, disables HTTPS verification for OAuthlib (potential security risk), retrieves an API key via get_api_key(), and raises an error if missing. It then initializes the YouTube API client using the discovery.build() function with the provided API key. The disabling of HTTPS verification indicates a development or local testing environment but is insecure for production. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic is present, and third-party libraries are used appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions to set up a YouTube API client securely in development but contains insecure practices such as disabling HTTPS verification, which should not be used in production. No malicious behavior or malware is evident. The main concern is the insecure environment setting rather than malicious intent.",
