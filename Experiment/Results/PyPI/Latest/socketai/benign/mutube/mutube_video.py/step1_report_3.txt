{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with the YouTube Data API to retrieve video snippets, statistics, and channel information, and checks if a video URL corresponds to a YouTube Shorts.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URL (requests.head for YouTube Shorts URL), API calls via youtube.videos().list and youtube.search().list, reading data from API responses (e.g., response['items'])",
  "sinks": "Use of response data for further API calls and data processing; no direct untrusted data sinks identified beyond data retrieval",
  "flows": "Input data (video IDs) from function parameters flow into API requests; responses are processed and used to determine video details and presence of Shorts; no dangerous data flows identified",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, suspicious URLs, or unusual code constructs; external request to check URL existence is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs API calls to YouTube's API, retrieves video and channel data, and checks if a URL corresponds to a Shorts video by performing an HTTP HEAD request. It processes API responses to filter and compile video information. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or harmful behaviors. External requests are limited to verifying URL existence, which is standard. The code does not handle sensitive data insecurely, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for fetching and processing YouTube video data. No malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks are evident. It is a straightforward implementation using public APIs and standard HTTP requests. Therefore, the overall security risk is very low.",
