{
  "purpose": "The class provides a simple substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings using special Unicode characters.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt() and encrypted tokens provided to decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "Returns the transformed strings; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input string → replace() substitutions in encrypt() → output encrypted string; encrypted string → reverse substitutions in decrypt() → output original string.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward character replacements without external dependencies, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The replacement approach is very basic and reversible, with no malicious behavior or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a simple substitution cipher via sequential replace() calls in both encrypt() and decrypt() methods. No external data sources, network activity, or file operations are involved. The method is symmetric and stateless, only converting characters to and from special Unicode symbols. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The approach is insecure for cryptographic purposes but does not constitute malware or security risk. The code structure is straightforward and clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic, reversible character substitution cipher intended for simple obfuscation of strings. It contains no malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Its security is minimal, but it poses no evident security threat or malicious intent.",
