{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode and decode strings by replacing characters with symbols and vice versa, functioning as a simple obfuscation or encoding mechanism.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods when called with a string argument.",
  "sinks": "The replaced output is returned directly; no external sinks or data outputs such as network or file operations are present within this code.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow into 'encrypt' which transforms characters into symbols; output flows from 'encrypt' and similarly, 'decrypt' transforms symbols back into characters, creating a reversible encoding flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code solely performs character replacement. No use of environment variables or insecure functions. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The class performs character substitution to encode and decode strings. It employs straightforward replace calls for each character mapping. No external dependencies, no network, no file I/O, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns. It appears as a simple encoding utility without malicious intent. The design is straightforward, with explicit mappings, and does not perform any operations that could be considered malicious or harmful. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign character substitution utility with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It functions as a reversible encoding mechanism for strings, with no malicious or backdoor features.",
