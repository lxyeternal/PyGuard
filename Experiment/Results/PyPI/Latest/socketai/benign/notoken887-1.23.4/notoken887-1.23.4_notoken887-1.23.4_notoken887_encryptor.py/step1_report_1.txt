{
  "purpose": "This class provides methods for encoding and decoding a string by substituting characters with corresponding symbols, effectively acting as a simple substitution cipher.",
  "sources": "The input data is provided to the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods as parameters: 'string' for encryption, 'encrypted_token' for decryption.",
  "sinks": "The methods output transformed strings; potential risk arises if these methods are used to obfuscate malicious payloads or sensitive data, but there are no direct sinks such as network operations or file writes within this code.",
  "flows": "Input string is transformed character-by-character into symbols in 'encrypt', and symbols are transformed back into characters in 'decrypt'. No external data flow or communication occurs within these methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a straightforward character substitution cipher without any external dependencies or side effects. The use of only replacement functions suggests no obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or data leaks. The substitution mappings are extensive but benign.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a basic substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings. Both methods simply replace characters with predefined symbols and vice versa. The implementation does not involve external data, no code execution, and no malicious operations. The code is well-structured and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It appears purely for encoding/decoding purposes without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple character substitution cipher with no malicious or maliciously intended behavior. It does not contain any security vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. Overall, it is benign and does not pose a security risk.",
