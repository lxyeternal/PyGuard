  "purpose": "Implements a reversible substitution cipher for encoding and decoding characters into symbols and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings to be encrypted or decrypted via method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Output strings after substitution; no external data sinks or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace characters with symbols (encrypt); symbols -> replace back with characters (decrypt).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static character replacements; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple, symmetric substitution cipher using chained .replace() calls. It has no external dependencies, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The mappings are static and explicit, making the process transparent and reversible. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscation beyond the character substitutions. The extensive replacements could be considered a form of obfuscation, but they are straightforward and not malicious. The malware score is appropriately zero; the security risk is minimal, around 0.1, due to the potential for misuse in hiding malicious payloads but not inherently malicious. The obfuscation score could be moderately higher (around 0.6) due to the extensive character mappings, but this is not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a reversible substitution cipher with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. Its extensive character replacements serve primarily as obfuscation but do not constitute malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware at 0, low security risk, and obfuscation reflecting the extensive substitutions. Overall, the code poses no security threat and functions solely as an encoding utility.",
