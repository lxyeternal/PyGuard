{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to provide a simple reversible substitution cipher for strings, replacing alphanumeric characters with specific symbols and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings to encrypt or decrypt data via method calls with parameters 'string' and 'encrypted_token'.",
  "sinks": "The code performs string replacements which are internal transformations; there are no direct sinks that lead to data leaks, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via sequential replace operations in 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, converting characters to symbols and back. No external data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses extensive chained string replacements but contains no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or system modifications. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are apparent. The mapping appears consistent and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a symmetric substitution cipher, where each character is replaced with a specific symbol in 'encrypt' and restored in 'decrypt'. The implementation is purely string manipulation without any external data handling, network activity, or system modifications. The cipher is weak cryptographically but does not exhibit malicious intent. There are no hidden backdoors, suspicious network connections, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be a benign utility for encoding/decoding strings with simple character substitution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, reversible character substitution cipher intended for obfuscation purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The design is straightforward and does not perform any external actions or data leaks.",
