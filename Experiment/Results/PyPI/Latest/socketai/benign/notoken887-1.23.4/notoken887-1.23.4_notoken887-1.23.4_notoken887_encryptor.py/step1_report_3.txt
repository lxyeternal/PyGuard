{
  "purpose": "The class provides a simple substitution cipher to encode and decode strings by replacing characters with specific symbols and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided through method arguments 'string' for encryption and 'encrypted_token' for decryption.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network operations are present; data is processed entirely within method calls.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via character replacements for both encryption and decryption; data flows from method input through replacement chains to output.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs extensive character replacement for obfuscation, but this is a straightforward substitution cipher. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious operations are evident. No use of external inputs, environment variables, or network communication. No malicious code or behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a reversible substitution cipher using replace calls for both encryption and decryption. The character mappings are static and do not involve any external data, network access, or sensitive information handling. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The complexity and length of the replacement chains appear to be for obfuscation or simple encoding purposes only, not malicious intent. The structure is clear and does not contain obfuscated or misleading code constructs beyond the substitution mappings.",
  "conclusion": "This class implements a basic character substitution cipher without any malicious functionality or suspicious behavior. It does not exhibit signs of malware or security risks. The code appears to be intended for encoding and decoding strings in a straightforward manner, possibly for obfuscation or simple encoding.",
