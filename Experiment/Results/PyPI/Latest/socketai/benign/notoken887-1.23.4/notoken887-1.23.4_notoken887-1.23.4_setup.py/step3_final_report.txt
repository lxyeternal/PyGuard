  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution, including name, version, author info, description, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Static string literals in setup() parameters: name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input or data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; static data used solely for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious contact info: author_email='hitler@gmail.com' and url='https://thugging.org'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with static metadata. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The only notable anomalies are the unprofessional contact details, which do not influence code behavior but could be used for social engineering or reputational issues. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero; security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by metadata concerns. The code itself poses no security threat, and the anomalies are metadata-related.",
  "conclusion": "The package is benign from a technical security perspective. The suspicious contact info is a metadata concern but does not constitute malicious code or behavior. The scores assigned are consistent with the static, straightforward nature of the script. No further action is necessary beyond noting the metadata issues.",
