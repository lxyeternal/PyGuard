  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided directly via the setup() parameters within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the setup() parameters directly into the package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The author email 'hitler@gmail.com' is suspicious and unprofessional; the URL 'https://thugging.org' is potentially malicious or dubious. No code obfuscation or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity. The author email and URL are unusual but not malicious in themselves; they may indicate untrustworthy intent or a malicious actor using provocative or inappropriate information. No security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code are detected within the script. The setup parameters are straightforward and serve typical package configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with suspicious contact details and URL that could be considered unprofessional or malicious. There is no malicious code or malware present. The main concern is the questionable metadata, not the code behavior itself.",
