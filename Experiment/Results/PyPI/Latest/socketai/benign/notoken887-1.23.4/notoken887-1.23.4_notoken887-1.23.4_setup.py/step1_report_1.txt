  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Static data fields within the setup() function: name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "The email address 'hitler@gmail.com' is suspiciously unprofessional and potentially malicious in context. The URL 'https://thugging.org' is unusual and may indicate malicious intent or malicious hosting, but it is not inherently malicious in code. No obfuscation, hidden code, or dynamic behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python module. It only contains static configuration data without any dynamic or untrusted inputs. The author email and URL are unusual but do not directly pose security risks within this context. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated content. No external libraries or code execution occur. Overall, it appears to be a typical package configuration file with some suspicious contact info, but nothing malicious in behavior or structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The suspicious email and URL may warrant further review outside of code analysis but do not constitute malware or security threats within this script.",
