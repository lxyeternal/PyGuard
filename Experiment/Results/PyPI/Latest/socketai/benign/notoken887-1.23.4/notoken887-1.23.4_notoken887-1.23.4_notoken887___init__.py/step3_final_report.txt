  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source dependency by reviewing the provided code snippets for malicious behavior, anomalies, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data is limited; no explicit input sources identified. The code snippets or descriptions do not specify data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points are evident in the provided snippets; no untrusted data handling or external communications are observed.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are identifiable due to minimal code context; the code appears benign and isolated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected in the provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or incomplete code with no suspicious patterns, anomalies, or obfuscation. The malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators. Risk scores are low (0.1-0.3), reflecting limited context but no evidence of threats. Confidence levels vary but are generally appropriate given the limited information. The reasoning in each report is cautious and justified, with no contradictions or overlooked signals.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the collective review, the code snippets do not exhibit malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the security risk is minimal. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
