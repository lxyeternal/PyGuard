  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific functionality within a Python package, but the exact purpose cannot be determined due to lack of code content.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly visible; the code does not show explicit input functions or data reads. If environment variables or external files are used elsewhere, they are not shown here.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are visible within the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from sources to sinks in the provided snippet. Without additional code, source-to-sink paths cannot be established.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are detected within this fragment. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited due to absence of actual code content. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks evident from the provided fragment. Since no external interactions, environment variable usage, or payloads are shown, the code appears benign based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided code fragment, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears normal and does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
