  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or system interaction, but the specific intent is unclear due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, imported modules, and possibly from external files or network requests (if present in unseen parts of code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system commands, which could be used to exfiltrate data or execute malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through processing functions towards sinks like network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No explicit anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are evident from the provided snippet. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or incomplete, making it challenging to identify specific malicious behaviors. It does not contain obvious indicators of malicious intent such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is standard, and no suspicious code constructs are apparent. Due to limited information, confidence is low regarding malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but the lack of context limits full assessment. No malicious indicators or anomalies are detected.",
