  "purpose": "Retrieve an enum member from an Enum class based on its value",
  "sources": "Access to e.__members__, iterating over Enum members",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing the matched enum member",
  "flows": "Input: e (Enum class), v (value); Output: enum member matching value v",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious external calls, or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The function iterates over the members of an Enum class 'e' using '__members__'. It compares each member's 'value' attribute to the provided value 'v'. If a match is found, it returns the corresponding Enum member. The code uses standard Enum introspection and comparison without external input handling or malicious logic. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The implementation appears straightforward and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a common operation of retrieving an Enum member by value without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No security issues or malware indicators are present.",
