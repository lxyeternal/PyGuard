  "purpose": "Function to retrieve an enum member by its value",
  "sources": "Reads enum members via e.__members__.items()",
  "sinks": "Returns an enum member; no evident sinks for untrusted data processing",
  "flows": "Input enum class e and value v to match and return corresponding member",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward enum lookup with no obfuscation or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that iterates over the members of an enum class e, comparing each member's value to the input v. If a match is found, it returns the corresponding enum member. The implementation appears standard and benign, with no suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or external data handling. It does not involve network operations, file I/O, or environment variables. The function is typical for enum utility purposes, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enum lookup function with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It serves a benign purpose and does not contain obfuscation or malware.",
