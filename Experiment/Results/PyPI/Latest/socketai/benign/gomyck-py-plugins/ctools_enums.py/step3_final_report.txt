  "purpose": "Retrieve an enum member from enum class 'e' based on its value 'v'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the enum class's __members__ attribute and iterates over its items.",
  "sinks": "The code compares each member.value to 'v' and returns the matching member; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'e' and 'v' are used to iterate over 'e.__members__' and compare 'member.value' to 'v', returning the match.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward enum lookup pattern with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for retrieving an enum member by value. It iterates over 'e.__members__' and compares each member's 'value' to 'v'. No external calls, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. All reports correctly identify this as a benign utility function. Malware score is 0, security risk is effectively 0, and confidence is high (1). The code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard enum lookup function with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
