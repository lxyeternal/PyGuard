{
  "purpose": "The function 'value_of' retrieves an enumeration member from an enum class 'e' based on its value 'v'.",
  "sources": "Reads the input parameters 'e' (expected to be an enum class) and 'v' (the value to find).",
  "sinks": "Returns a member object; no untrusted data output or external data sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'v' is compared against the 'value' attribute of each enum member in 'e'. If a match is found, that member is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures are present. No external or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that iterates over all members of an enum class 'e' to find and return the member with a specific value 'v'. It uses '__members__' to access enum members, which is standard. No external data sources or sinks, nor dynamic code execution, are present. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function for enum lookups. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs a standard operation securely and predictably.",
