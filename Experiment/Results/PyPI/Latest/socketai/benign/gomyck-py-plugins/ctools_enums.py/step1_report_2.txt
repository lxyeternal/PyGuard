  "purpose": "Retrieve an enum member from an Enum class based on its value.",
  "sources": "Access to the Enum class 'e' and its __members__ attribute, which contains all enum members.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing the matched enum member; no other data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input 'e' and 'v' flow into the function; if a match is found, the enum member is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No external data sources or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The function iterates over the items in an Enum's __members__, comparing each member's value to the provided 'v'. If a match is found, it returns the corresponding enum member. This is a standard pattern for looking up enum members by value. No code injection, data leaks, environment variable misuse, or other malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and does not include obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a simple utility purpose of retrieving an enum member by value. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be benign, standard, and safe.",
