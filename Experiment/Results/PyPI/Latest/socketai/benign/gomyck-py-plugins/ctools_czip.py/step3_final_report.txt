  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating password-protected ZIP archives from files or directories, using pyzipper for encryption.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads: open(file_path, 'rb') for each file in directory or list; data is read into memory before compression.",
  "sinks": "Writing ZIP archive to disk via open(output_path, 'wb') and writing in-memory ZIP buffer.",
  "flows": "Filesystem read -> in-memory ZIP compression (with optional password) -> write ZIP file to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or network activity. Exception handling is standard. No backdoors or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file compression with optional password protection using pyzipper. It reads files from disk, compresses them in memory, and writes ZIP archives back to disk. No obfuscation, suspicious behaviors, or malicious activities are present. Exception handling is straightforward, and the use of pyzipper is legitimate. The data flow is simple and transparent. No hardcoded secrets or network communication are involved. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility for creating password-protected ZIP archives. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate and justified.",
