  "purpose": "Spatial data point reduction using a recursive Douglas-Peucker-like algorithm for simplifying geospatial points.",
  "sources": "Input points array, parsed via jsonpath expressions to extract longitude and latitude from each point.",
  "sinks": "Formatted output points, either as raw data or JSON-loaded objects, based on ret_tpl configuration.",
  "flows": "Input data -> JSONPath parsing -> geometric calculations (line and distance) -> recursive point reduction -> formatted output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; use of dynamic JSONPath expressions and format strings could pose minimal configuration risks but are not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard spatial point reduction algorithm (similar to Douglas-Peucker). It uses external libraries (`jsonpath_ng`, `ctools`) appropriately for JSON parsing and formatting. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. Input validation is minimal but sufficient for typical use. The recursive logic correctly identifies points to retain or discard based on perpendicular distance to a line. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The scoring aligns with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate spatial data processing utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It maintains a low security risk profile, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1-0.2). The assessments are consistent and justified.",
