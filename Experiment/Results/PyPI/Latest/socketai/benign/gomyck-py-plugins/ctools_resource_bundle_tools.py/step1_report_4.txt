{
  "purpose": "The code manages resource packaging, signing, verification, and unpacking using cryptographic methods.",
  "sources": "File reads for private and public keys, manifest.json, and resource files; reading from file system; reading uploaded resource files.",
  "sinks": "Reading private/public key files, reading and writing resource files, zip extraction and creation, JSON handling, MD5 hash computation.",
  "flows": "Input resource file -> MD5 hash comparison -> ZIP extraction -> manifest signature verification -> resource extraction; manifest signing -> ZIP creation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of MD5 hashing for integrity checks (weak); signing with RSA but without explicit padding checks; possible reliance on external key files; no obvious hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles cryptographic signing and verification of resource packages, including resource compression and decompression. It uses standard cryptographic practices with RSA and MD5 hashes. Although MD5 is weak for cryptographic integrity, it is used here for checksum purposes, not security-critical signing. Key files are read from the filesystem, which is typical for such operations. No obfuscated code, suspicious network calls, or malicious actions are present. The functions appear to perform expected resource management tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a resource packaging and verification module that uses cryptographic signatures for integrity checks. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are evident. The only minor concern is reliance on MD5 for checksum, which is acceptable here as a non-security-critical integrity check. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for legitimate resource management purposes.",
