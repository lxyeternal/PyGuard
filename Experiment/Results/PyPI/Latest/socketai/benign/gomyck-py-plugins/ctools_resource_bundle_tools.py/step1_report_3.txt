{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for signing, verifying signatures, packaging, and unpacking resource files with integrity and authenticity checks.",
  "sources": "Reading private and public keys from filesystem, reading resource files, reading 'manifest.json', and reading input files for checksum.",
  "sinks": "Writing signed manifest files, extracting zip files, and writing packaged zip files.",
  "flows": "Input files (keys, resource files, manifests) are read; signatures are generated or verified; zip files are created or extracted based on these operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. Use of cryptographic functions is appropriate, but the private key is read from a fixed path, which could be sensitive if misused. No obfuscation or misleading variable names. The code performs signature generation and verification securely. No malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script handles cryptographic signing and verification using RSA keys, manages resource packaging and unpackaging, and verifies signatures to ensure integrity. The key files are read from specific paths, which is standard for secure key handling, but the code assumes the presence of valid keys and does not include fallback or validation for key presence. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors detected. The functions operate within expected parameters for resource management, with appropriate use of cryptographic and filesystem APIs. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate cryptographic signing, verification, and resource management functions without indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It appears to be a standard implementation for resource integrity management, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
