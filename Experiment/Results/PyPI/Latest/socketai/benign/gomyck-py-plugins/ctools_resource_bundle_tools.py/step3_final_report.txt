{
  "purpose": "The code manages resource packaging, signing, verification, and extraction using RSA cryptography and MD5 hashing, primarily for resource integrity and authenticity.",
  "sources": "Reads private key from '/keys/resource_private_key.pem', reads public key from '/keys/resource_public_key.pem', reads 'manifest.json' within zip files, reads files during packaging.",
  "sinks": "Uses RSA signing and verification functions, which process data for signature creation and validation; no data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Manifest data is formatted and hashed; private key signs the hash; signature is stored in manifest; verification involves reading the signature, recomputing hash, and verifying with public key; checksum compares file MD5 with computed MD5.",
  "anomalies": "Use of MD5 hashing with a static salt ('gomyck-daning') for checksum and digest, which is cryptographically weak but not malicious; reliance on fixed key file paths; no obfuscation or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs resource signing, verification, and packaging with standard cryptographic libraries. It correctly verifies signatures before resource extraction, ensuring integrity. The use of MD5 and static salt are security weaknesses but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The cryptographic practices are outdated but not malicious. The key management via fixed paths is typical but could be risky if keys are compromised. Overall, the code is clear, well-structured, and functions as intended for resource integrity management.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Its primary issues are cryptographic weaknesses due to MD5 and static salts, which are security concerns but not indicators of malicious activity. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, reflecting these weaknesses. The code appears legitimate with no evidence of sabotage or malicious intent.",
