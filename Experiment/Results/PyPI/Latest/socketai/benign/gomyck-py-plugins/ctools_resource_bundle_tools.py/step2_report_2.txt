  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe code that handles cryptographic signing, verification, resource packaging, and unpacking.\n- The code uses RSA keys stored on disk, with MD5 hashing for checksum and digest purposes.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident.\n- The main concern across reports is the use of MD5, which is cryptographically weak, but this alone does not imply malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are reported or evident.\n- The code's purpose appears to be resource integrity management, with standard cryptographic practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No actual vulnerabilities or malicious code are present. The code functions as intended for resource signing and verification.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The main flaw is the use of MD5, which is outdated for cryptographic security, but it is used here for checksum purposes, not security-critical signing.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate. Security risk scores are low (~0.2-0.3), reflecting minor concerns about MD5 and key management.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n#### 1. **Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`. This is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n- No need to increase this score.\n\n#### 2. **Obfuscated:**\n- All reports state `obfuscated: 0`. Correct, no obfuscation detected.\n\n#### 3. **Security Risk:**\n- Slight variation (0.2-0.3), mainly due to the use of MD5 and reading keys from disk.\n- This is reasonable; no higher scores are justified unless malicious behavior is present.\n\n#### 4. **Claims about vulnerabilities:**\n- No report claims the code is vulnerable to specific exploits, only notes the cryptographic weaknesses (MD5).\n- The reasoning is sound; MD5 is weak but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No report overstates or understates the risk.\n- The conclusions are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2–0.3 (minor concerns about MD5 and key management, but not serious)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (safe, no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to cryptographic weaknesses and key handling practices)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is standard for resource signing and verification, with no malicious intent. The main security concern is the use of MD5, which is outdated, but this does not elevate the risk to malicious or malware levels.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, with perhaps a slight increase in risk if considering cryptographic best practices, but overall, the assessments are justified.",
