  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Its primary issues are cryptographic weaknesses due to MD5 and static salts, which are security concerns but not indicators of malicious activity. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, reflecting these weaknesses. The code appears legitimate with no evidence of sabotage or malicious intent."
