{
  "purpose": "The code manages resource package signing, verification, and packaging for deployment, ensuring integrity and authenticity of resource files.",
  "sources": "Reads private key, public key, resource files, manifest.json, and file content during signing, verification, and packaging processes.",
  "sinks": "Reads cryptographic keys from files; reads and writes resource files and manifests; reads uploaded resource files for MD5 checksum calculation.",
  "flows": "Loads private key -> signs data -> writes signature into manifest -> packs resource files -> verifies signatures upon unpacking -> extracts resources if verification passes.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded string 'gomyck-daning' for MD5 hashing, which is a static salt; no input sanitization is evident; relies on external key files which may pose security risks if compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code handles cryptographic signing and verification using RSA keys stored on disk, which is standard but depends on key security. MD5 hashing is used with a static salt, which is weak but not necessarily malicious. The code reads resource files, computes checksums, and verifies signatures to ensure integrity. It unpacks zip files after checksum validation and signature verification, preventing tampered files from being extracted. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. Sensitive files like private keys are read from disk, but this is typical for such applications. The code does not perform any malicious actions like data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication beyond file handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard resource signing, verification, and packaging functions with no apparent malicious intent. It properly verifies signatures before extracting resources and uses cryptographic practices typical for such tasks. The static salt in MD5 is a minor security concern but not malicious. Overall, the code appears safe with no malicious behavior detected.",
