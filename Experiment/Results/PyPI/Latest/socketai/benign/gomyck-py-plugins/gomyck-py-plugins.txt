      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Its primary issues are cryptographic weaknesses due to MD5 and static salts, which are security concerns but not indicators of malicious activity. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, reflecting these weaknesses. The code appears legitimate with no evidence of sabotage or malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, low-risk MQTT utility with encryption features. Minor bugs should be fixed, but there are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The supply chain security risk is very low, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The overall security risk score is approximately 0.2."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of symmetric encryption using Fernet. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The minor decoding of the key is not a security flaw but should be documented properly. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for cryptographic purposes."
