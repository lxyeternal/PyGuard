{
  "purpose": "Provides a method to determine a file path based on the execution context, either running in a frozen (packaged) state or as a script, for resource access.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables like sys.frozen and sys._MEIPASS, and the __file__ attribute from the caller frame.",
  "sinks": "Returns a constructed file path based on the caller location or package extraction directory.",
  "flows": "Input sources (sys.frozen, sys._MEIPASS, __file__) influence the selection of the base path, which is then concatenated with subPath to generate an output path.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic inspection of call frames and environment variables but does not perform any unusual or suspicious operations; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The function determines the execution environment (frozen or not) to locate resource paths. It utilizes inspect to get caller frame info, which is a standard practice in packaging scripts with tools like PyInstaller. The path construction appears straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious logic. No external data is read beyond standard environment variables and call frames, and no data is sent or received over networks. The code structure is simple and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for locating resource paths depending on the execution context. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs environment checks and path concatenation securely, with no suspicious side-effects.",
