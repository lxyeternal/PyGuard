  "anomalies": "None; standard environment detection and path resolution logic",
  "analysis": "The code checks if running in a frozen environment using sys.frozen and sys._MEIPASS; if so, it uses sys._MEIPASS as base_path. Otherwise, it uses inspect to get the caller's __file__ attribute and derives its directory. It then concatenates base_path with an optional subPath. The modules used are standard, and no suspicious or malicious operations are present. The logic is straightforward and common in packaged Python applications. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The use of inspect for caller frame info is safe here, given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for environment-aware path resolution, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No further action needed.",
