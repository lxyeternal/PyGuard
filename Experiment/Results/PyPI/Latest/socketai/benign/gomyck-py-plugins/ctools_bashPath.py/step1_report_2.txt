  "purpose": "Provide a file path based on whether the script is running in a frozen/executable state or as a regular script, optionally appending a subPath.",
  "sources": "sys.frozen, sys._MEIPASS, inspect.currentframe(), inspect.currentframe().f_back, __file__",
  "sinks": "os.path.sep concatenation for path output",
  "flows": "sys.frozen or sys._MEIPASS -> path() return value; inspect.currentframe() -> caller frame -> __file__ -> os.path.dirname -> return path",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys._MEIPASS indicates handling of PyInstaller's bundled environment; no suspicious code, but dynamic path resolution might be exploited if misused. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the base path depending on whether it is running as a frozen executable (using sys._MEIPASS) or as a normal script (using inspect to get the caller's __file__ attribute). It then concatenates the base path with an optional subPath. The use of sys._MEIPASS is standard in applications bundled with PyInstaller. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of dynamic path resolution in different execution contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard path resolution for scripts and bundled applications, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It’s a straightforward utility function with no anomalies or malicious behavior.",
