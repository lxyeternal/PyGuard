  "purpose": "Fetches an image from a URL and displays it in a Tkinter window with tips.",
  "sources": "requests.get() call to retrieve image content from the provided URL.",
  "sinks": "ImageTk.PhotoImage() displays the image in the GUI; no data leaks or external communication beyond fetching the image.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves image data -> Image.open() processes image -> ImageTk.PhotoImage() displays image in GUI.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward task of fetching and displaying an image with tips. It uses standard libraries and methods, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The external URL dependency is typical for such utilities but could pose a risk if the URL is malicious; however, this is a common operational consideration rather than a security flaw.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The reliance on an external URL introduces minimal risk, justified by the lack of malicious activity. The overall security risk score is low, and malware score is zero.",
