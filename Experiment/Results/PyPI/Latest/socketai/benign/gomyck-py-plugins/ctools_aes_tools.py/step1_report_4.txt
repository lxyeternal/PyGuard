{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for generating encryption keys and performing symmetric encryption and decryption using the Fernet module from the cryptography library.",
  "sources": "The key generation function generates a key internally. The encrypt and decrypt functions take external inputs: sec_key, plaintext, and ciphertext.",
  "sinks": "The encrypt function outputs encrypted data. The decrypt function outputs decrypted plaintext. Both use external inputs for keys and data, but no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations that could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "generate_key() -> returns key; aes_encrypt(sec_key, plaintext) -> outputs ciphertext; aes_decrypt(sec_key, ciphertext) -> outputs plaintext.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are present. Use of Fernet is standard for symmetric encryption; decode() and encode() are used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard cryptography practices with the Fernet library. It generates keys, encrypts, and decrypts data securely without any suspicious behavior or malicious logic. There are no signs of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious commands. The functions handle encryption tasks appropriately and safely. No external dependencies or inputs suggest malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of symmetric encryption using Fernet with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It functions as expected for secure data handling.",
