  "purpose": "This code provides functions to generate an encryption key, and to encrypt and decrypt data using symmetric encryption (Fernet).",
  "sources": "The key generation function generates a cryptographic key; the encrypt and decrypt functions take input data (plaintext and ciphertext respectively).",
  "sinks": "The encrypt function outputs encrypted ciphertext; the decrypt function outputs decrypted plaintext; both could be sources of data leakage if misused.",
  "flows": "The key generated by generate_key() is used in aes_encrypt() and aes_decrypt() as the sec_key; plaintext is encrypted into ciphertext; ciphertext is decrypted back into plaintext.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code performs standard cryptographic operations using Fernet; no obfuscated or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward functions for key generation, encryption, and decryption using Fernet symmetric encryption. The key is generated securely with Fernet.generate_key(), and encoding/decoding are correctly handled. No suspicious or malicious constructs are observed. The functions do not contain input/output handling beyond the provided parameters, and do not interact with external data sources or network operations. The code appears to be a clean implementation of cryptographic functions, with proper use of the cryptography library. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard symmetric encryption functionalities without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate cryptographic utility, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
