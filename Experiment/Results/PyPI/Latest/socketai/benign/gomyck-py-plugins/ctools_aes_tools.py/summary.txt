  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of symmetric encryption using Fernet. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The minor decoding of the key is not a security flaw but should be documented properly. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for cryptographic purposes."
