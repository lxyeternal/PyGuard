  "purpose": "Provides symmetric encryption and decryption functions using Fernet, generating and handling cryptographic keys.",
  "sources": "Key generation via Fernet.generate_key(), key decoding with .decode(), plaintext input for encryption, ciphertext input for decryption.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted data output, decrypted plaintext output.",
  "flows": "generate_key() creates and returns a base64-encoded key as a string; aes_encrypt() takes plaintext and key, encrypts to produce ciphertext; aes_decrypt() takes ciphertext and key, decrypts to plaintext.",
  "anomalies": "Decoding the Fernet key with .decode() is unnecessary but not malicious; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic practices with Fernet for symmetric encryption. The key is generated securely and returned as a string, which is typical for storage or transmission. The encryption and decryption functions correctly instantiate Fernet objects with the provided key, perform operations, and handle data appropriately. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious behaviors are evident. The only minor point is the decoding of the key, which could be unnecessary but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. All reports agree on the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks, which aligns with the code's straightforward implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of symmetric encryption using Fernet. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The minor decoding of the key is not a security flaw but should be documented properly. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for cryptographic purposes.",
