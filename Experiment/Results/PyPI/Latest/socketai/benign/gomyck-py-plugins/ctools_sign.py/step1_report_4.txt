{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate cryptographic signatures for files and string values using HMAC with SHA-256.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from files specified by file_path and from string values passed as arguments to the digest function.",
  "sinks": "The code computes and returns cryptographic hashes and signatures, which could be used in data integrity or authentication processes.",
  "flows": "Input data (file contents or string values) are hashed with SHA-256, then combined with a secret key using HMAC to produce signatures.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a hardcoded global secret key ('gomyck2014'), which may be a security concern if exposed; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly uses cryptographic primitives for signature generation, with proper hashing and HMAC application. The presence of a hardcoded key is a security best practice violation but not malicious per se. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The try-except block in generate_signature suppresses errors, which might hide issues but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of file and string signature generation. The use of a hardcoded key is a security concern but not malicious. There are no indications of malware or malicious behavior.",
