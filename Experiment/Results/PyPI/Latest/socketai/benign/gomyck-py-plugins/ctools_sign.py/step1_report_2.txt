  "purpose": "Generate cryptographic signatures for files and string values using HMAC with SHA-256.",
  "sources": "Reading input files (file_path) and string values (value parameter).",
  "sinks": "HMAC digest generation and returning hex-encoded signatures.",
  "flows": "File content read -> hash generated -> HMAC signed -> return signature; String value hashed -> HMAC signed -> return signature.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a global hard-coded key ('gomyck2014') for cryptographic signing, which is a security risk if exposed; exception handling silently returns an empty string without logging or error reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to generate HMAC signatures from file contents and string inputs. The use of a hardcoded key ('gomyck2014') compromises key secrecy, making signatures predictable if the key is known. The functions are straightforward cryptographic operations without malicious behavior but the hardcoded key represents a security vulnerability. Exception handling is minimal, silently returning an empty string which could obscure errors but is not malicious. No suspicious or malicious code patterns or obfuscated code present. No external network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard cryptographic signing operations but uses a hardcoded secret key, which is a security concern. There is no malicious intent or malware present, but the use of a static key undermines security best practices. The overall risk is moderate due to potential key exposure.",
