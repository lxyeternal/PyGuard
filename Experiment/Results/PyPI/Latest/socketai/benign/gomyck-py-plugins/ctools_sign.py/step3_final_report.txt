{
  "purpose": "Provides cryptographic signatures for files and strings using HMAC-SHA256 with a static key.",
  "sources": "Reads file contents in binary mode; takes string input for digest function.",
  "sinks": "Uses the key in HMAC operations; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads file -> hashes content -> signs hash; input string -> hashes -> signs; both use static key.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded secret key 'gomyck2014'; minimal exception handling silently suppresses errors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic operations without malicious payloads. The static key is a security concern but does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious data flows are present. Exception handling is broad and silent, which could hide errors but is not malicious. Overall, the code is a straightforward utility with security best practice violations but no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign cryptographic utility code with a security vulnerability due to the hardcoded key. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The primary issue is security best practice violation, not malicious activity.",
