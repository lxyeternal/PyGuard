  "purpose": "A standard setup.py script defining package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields: name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution or data flow; only static metadata.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static assignment of metadata values.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org'; description mentions 'obfuscation test lib' but no obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static metadata. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected. The only notable anomalies are unprofessional contact info and URL, which do not impact code security but could affect reputation. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as 0. The security risk score is slightly elevated (~0.2-0.3) due to metadata concerns, but no technical vulnerabilities exist. The code itself is benign, and the suspicious metadata should be flagged for review but does not constitute a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign and standard; no malicious or obfuscated code is present. The metadata contains unprofessional contact info and URL, which warrants caution but does not pose a security risk. Scores are consistent with the analysis.",
