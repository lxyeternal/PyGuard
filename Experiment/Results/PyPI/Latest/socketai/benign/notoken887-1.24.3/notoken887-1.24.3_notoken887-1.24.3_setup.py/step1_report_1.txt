  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'notoken887' Python library.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or output points present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration, no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of suspicious email address ('hitler@gmail.com') which is unprofessional and potentially malicious or offensive; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for package distribution. It contains typical package metadata with no dynamic input or code execution. The only notable anomaly is the email address, which is unprofessional and potentially malicious, but not technically malicious code. No suspicious code, obfuscated segments, or malicious behaviors are present. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with an unprofessional email address. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the code itself, but the email address warrants caution due to its inappropriate content.",
