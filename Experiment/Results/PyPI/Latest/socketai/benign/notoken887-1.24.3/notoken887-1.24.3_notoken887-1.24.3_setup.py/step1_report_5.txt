  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Input data from setup() arguments such as name, version, author, email, description, url, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data handling. No network connections or sensitive data processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from sources to sinks; typical setup script with static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard packaging practices. The email 'hitler@gmail.com' is suspicious in context but not technically malicious; it may indicate malicious intent or a provocative choice, but does not constitute code-based malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with static parameters defining package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, no network activity, and no sensitive data processing are present. The suspicious email address may be intended to be provocative but does not influence code security. The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python library, with no indicators of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup configuration with no malicious or security-risk behaviors. The only notable concern is the suspicious email address, which is not a technical security issue but may raise reputational concerns.",
