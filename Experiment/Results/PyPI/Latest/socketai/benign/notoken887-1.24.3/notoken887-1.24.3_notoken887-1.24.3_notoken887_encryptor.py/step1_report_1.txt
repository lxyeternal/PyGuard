{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution-based encryption and decryption of text using emoji characters as the cipher alphabet.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings for encryption and encrypted tokens for decryption via method parameters.",
  "sinks": "The methods return transformed strings; no external sinks or data outputs are present. No untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed through replacement mappings to produce encrypted or decrypted output.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward string replacement for substitution cipher without any cryptographic security measures; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. The emoji mappings are static and hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a basic substitution cipher by replacing each character with a corresponding emoji, then reversing the process in decryption. There are no external data inputs like network requests, file I/O, environment variables, or system calls. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform any harmful actions, data leaks, or system modifications. It appears purely educational or for simple obfuscation, not security or malware purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple substitution cipher implementation with static mappings. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It does not perform any dangerous actions or data exfiltration. The code is benign and primarily intended for encoding/decoding using emojis.",
