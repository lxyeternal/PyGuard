  "purpose": "A simple substitution cipher encoding and decoding strings using emoji mappings for characters and digits.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt or decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "Return of the transformed string; no external data or system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input string -> substitution replacements -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward replacement logic with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static character-to-emoji substitution for both encryption and decryption. It uses hardcoded mappings, with no external dependencies, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The methods are simple string replacements, reversible and transparent. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The substitution cipher is trivial and not cryptographically secure, but that does not imply malicious intent. The code is benign, intended for obfuscation or fun encoding, with no security risks or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static substitution cipher with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It does not obfuscate malicious intent, nor does it perform any harmful actions. The scores reflect this benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and security risk also at 0. The minor security risk score of 0.2 in one report overstates the risk; it should be 0, consistent with the code's behavior.",
