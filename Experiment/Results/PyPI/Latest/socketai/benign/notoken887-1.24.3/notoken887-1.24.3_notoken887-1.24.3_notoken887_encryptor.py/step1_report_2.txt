{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode (encrypt) and decode (decrypt) strings by replacing characters with corresponding emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods' parameters: 'string' and 'encrypted_token'.",
  "sinks": "Data is returned from the methods after character replacements; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via a series of replace operations, creating source-to-sink data flows within the methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs character substitution without any suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscated logic. It uses straightforward replace calls without external input handling, environment variable usage, or code execution functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a character mapping-based cipher with two methods: encrypt and decrypt, performing reverse replacements for character emojis and original characters. The logic is simple, stateless, and does not interact with external systems or perform any malicious actions. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, network calls, or obfuscation techniques present. The functions only perform local string transformations, which do not pose any security threat. The replacement of periods with a specific emoji is benign and reversible. Overall, the code appears purely for obfuscation or simple encoding purposes without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward character substitution cipher with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves only to encode and decode strings via emoji replacements, with no external interactions or hidden functionalities.",
