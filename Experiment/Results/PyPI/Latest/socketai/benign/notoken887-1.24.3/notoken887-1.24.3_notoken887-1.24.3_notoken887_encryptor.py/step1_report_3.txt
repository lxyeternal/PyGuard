{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple obfuscation by replacing alphanumeric characters and period with emojis, and can reverse this transformation. It appears to serve as a basic encoding/decoding utility.",
  "sources": "Input data is passed to the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods as strings, which are then transformed by replacing characters with emojis or vice versa.",
  "sinks": "The methods return transformed strings; there are no direct sinks involving untrusted data affecting external systems or leaking data.",
  "flows": "Input string → 'encrypt' method (character replacements) → output emoji string; emoji string → 'decrypt' method (inverse replacements) → output original string.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses extensive character replacement for encoding, but all operations are straightforward and limited to string transformations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. No external data access, network communication, or obfuscation techniques are used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic character substitution to encode and decode strings, mapping characters to emojis and vice versa. No external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution are involved. The design is simple and self-contained, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation lacks complex logic, obfuscation, or hidden functionalities, indicating it is purely a utility for character substitution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign character substitution utility that encodes and decodes strings using emojis. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or malware in this implementation.",
