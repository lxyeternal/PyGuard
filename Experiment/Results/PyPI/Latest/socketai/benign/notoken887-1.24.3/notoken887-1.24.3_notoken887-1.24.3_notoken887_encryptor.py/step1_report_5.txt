{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution cipher encryption and decryption for strings using emoji mappings.",
  "sources": "The input data is taken as a string argument to the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "The encrypted or decrypted strings are returned; no external sinks or data leaks are present within this code.",
  "flows": "Input string → replace method transformations → output encrypted/decrypted string; no external or network flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward string replacements with no external data access, network activity, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The mappings are static and predictable, serving only to obscure text.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic substitution cipher via emoji replacements for characters. The 'encrypt' method replaces characters with emojis, while 'decrypt' reverses these replacements. There are no sources of external input beyond method parameters, no sinks such as network or file I/O, and no obfuscated or dynamic code execution. The logic is transparent and limited to character substitution, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The absence of external communication, environment manipulation, or complex logic indicates no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple character substitution cipher class that performs emoji-based encoding and decoding. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no external dependencies or suspicious features.",
