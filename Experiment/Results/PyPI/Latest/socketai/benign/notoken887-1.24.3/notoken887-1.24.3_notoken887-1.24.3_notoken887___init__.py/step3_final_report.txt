  "purpose": "Analysis of Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, user input, network data, hardcoded strings, dynamic eval/exec calls.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, file writes, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or environment variables flow into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, suspicious imports, hardcoded URLs or credentials, non-standard code structure, absence of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Reports 2 and 3 contain code; Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion. The current malware score (0.4) reflects moderate suspicion but could be slightly increased if confirmed malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation score (0.8) is justified by the described obfuscation techniques. Reports 1, 4, and 5 lack code and are correctly scored with zero risk. The overall assessment suggests that Report 2 warrants cautious monitoring, with scores adjusted to malware=0.3-0.4, obfuscated=0.8, securityRisk=0.6.",
  "conclusion": "The code in Report 2 exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating potential malicious intent, warranting a malware score around 0.3-0.4 and a security risk of 0.6. Other reports are benign or lack code, with appropriate scores. Slightly increasing the malware score in Report 2 reflects the suspicion without definitive malicious payloads.",
