  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard API for Fibonacci with blocklist management; inputs are path parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Inputs flow into `crud` functions; no direct data leaks or command execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or secrets. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard validation and data flow.\n- **Analysis:** No unsafe practices, no external system calls, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on input validation and standard API patterns.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; external CRUD functions are assumed safe.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar assessment, emphasizing that the code is a typical REST API with external CRUD dependencies.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Details that the code handles user input securely via Pydantic models, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** The external `crud` module is a concern, but since its implementation isn't shown, we can't assume malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity evident; the code appears safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is assigned uniformly, indicating low but not zero risk, primarily due to reliance on external modules (`crud`) whose internal security isn't verified.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minimal, mainly due to external dependencies; no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are consistent and justified based on the provided code snippet and analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                     |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2                   |\n\nThis code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior based on the provided information.",
