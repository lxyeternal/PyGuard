{
  "purpose": "The code provides a FastAPI-based Fibonacci sequence API with endpoints for retrieving Fibonacci numbers, ranges, and managing a blocklist.",
  "sources": "Input sources include path parameters (`sequence_number`, `page`, `limit`) and possibly external modules (crud operations).",
  "sinks": "Endpoints perform data retrieval and modification; particularly, the blocklist management modifies shared state via `crud` functions. No direct data leak or command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from URL parameters to `crud` functions, with no evident unsafe handling or insecure data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a REST API with multiple endpoints for Fibonacci calculations and blocklist management. It imports and uses external modules (`crud`) for core operations, which are not provided, but this does not imply malicious intent. All endpoints handle data in a controlled manner, with proper exception handling for known issues like 'ValueOnBlockList'. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or security misconfigurations within this snippet. The code does not process user input insecurely or execute arbitrary code. Overall, the implementation looks standard and clean, with no suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard, well-structured Fibonacci API implementation without any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. No signs of malware or malicious intent are evident based on this code snippet.",
