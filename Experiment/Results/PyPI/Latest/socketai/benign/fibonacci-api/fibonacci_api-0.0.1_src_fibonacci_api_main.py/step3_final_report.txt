  "purpose": "A simple Fibonacci API with blocklist management, providing endpoints for Fibonacci calculations, range retrieval, and blocklist operations.",
  "sources": "Path parameters for sequence_number, page, and limit; external crud module functions for data handling.",
  "sinks": "crud functions handling sequence_number and blocklist data; no direct data leaks or command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from API endpoints into crud functions; no external network or system commands are invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward FastAPI implementation with proper validation via Pydantic models. It handles user input securely, delegates data operations to an external crud module, and contains no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The external module's security cannot be verified here, but the code itself appears clean and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of a Fibonacci API with blocklist management. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The low security risk score of 0.2 reflects minimal inherent risk, primarily due to reliance on external modules whose security is unverified. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
