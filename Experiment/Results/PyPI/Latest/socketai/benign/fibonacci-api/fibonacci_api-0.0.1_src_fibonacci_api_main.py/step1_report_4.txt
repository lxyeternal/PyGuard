{
  "purpose": "The code implements a FastAPI-based Fibonacci sequence API with endpoints for retrieving Fibonacci numbers, ranges, and managing a blocklist.",
  "sources": "Input sources include path parameters (sequence_number, page, limit) and potentially external modules like crud functions.",
  "sinks": "External calls to 'crud' module functions; no direct data sinks observed in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "User inputs (path/query parameters) flow into 'crud' functions for data retrieval or modification; no untrusted data directly flows into sensitive operations within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for a REST API.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a REST API with endpoints for Fibonacci calculations and blocklist management, delegating core logic to imported 'crud' functions. No data validation issues are evident beyond standard use of Pydantic models. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code structure is typical for FastAPI applications, and there are no suspicious or potentially malicious code patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a Fibonacci API with blocklist management, with no indications of malware or malicious behavior. It mainly handles data via 'crud' module functions, which are not visible here. Based on this, the code is considered safe, with no security risks identified.",
