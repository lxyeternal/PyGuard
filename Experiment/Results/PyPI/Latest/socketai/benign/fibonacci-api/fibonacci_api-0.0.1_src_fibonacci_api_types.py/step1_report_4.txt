{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias for Fibonacci sequence numbers using Pydantic's Annotated with a validation constraint.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' and 'pydantic' libraries; definition of SequenceNumber.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; the code only defines a type alias.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there is no data processing; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "The comment suggests Fibonacci numbers are integers with x <= 0, but the code enforces 'greater than or equal to 0', which contradicts the comment. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a type alias 'SequenceNumber' as an annotated integer with a minimum value of 0. The comment mentions Fibonacci numbers 'x <= 0', which conflicts with the validation 'ge=0'. This inconsistency is suspicious but not malicious. There is no code execution, data handling, or security-sensitive operations present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type alias with an inconsistency in the comment. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The only concern is the contradictory comment, which may indicate a mistake rather than malicious intent.",
