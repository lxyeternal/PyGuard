  "purpose": "Define a non-negative integer type for sequence numbers, with a validation constraint.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'Annotated' from 'typing' and 'Field' from 'pydantic', then defines 'SequenceNumber' as an annotated int with a minimum value of 0.",
  "sinks": "No data input or output; static type alias with validation, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code is a static type alias without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The comment states 'Fibonacci sequence numbers are Int and x <= 0,' which conflicts with the code enforcing 'ge=0' (x >= 0). This inconsistency appears to be a documentation mistake, not malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple type alias for non-negative integers with a validation constraint. The only anomaly is the contradictory comment about Fibonacci numbers being 'x <= 0,' which conflicts with the code enforcing 'x >= 0.' All reports correctly identify this inconsistency as a documentation error. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present. The malware score is appropriately 0; the security risk score is very low (~0.1) due to the comment inconsistency but not a security concern. Confidence in this assessment is high (above 0.8).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with a minor documentation inconsistency. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The existing scores are appropriate; the only adjustment is to note the comment discrepancy for clarity. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward.",
