  "purpose": "Define a type alias for Fibonacci sequence numbers with validation constraints.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' and 'pydantic', specifically the 'Annotated' and 'Field' constructs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since the code only defines a type alias.",
  "anomalies": "Comment states 'Fibonacci sequence numbers are Int and x <= 0', but the annotation 'ge=0' enforces numbers greater than or equal to 0, which contradicts the comment. This inconsistency may suggest a potential mistake or miscommenting but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing and pydantic modules to create a type annotation for Fibonacci sequence numbers, enforcing that the number should be greater than or equal to 0. The comment about Fibonacci numbers being 'x <= 0' conflicts with the code constraint 'ge=0'. The code itself is straightforward and only defines a type alias without executing any logic or external calls. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent are present. The inconsistency appears to be a comment error rather than malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple type alias definition with a comment inconsistency. There are no malicious behaviors, no data leakage, or suspicious code actions present. Overall, this appears to be benign code with a minor comment discrepancy.",
