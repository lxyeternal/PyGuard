  "purpose": "Define a type alias for Fibonacci sequence numbers using Pydantic's Annotated with a validation constraint.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only type annotations and import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; code is purely defining a type alias.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or untrusted data processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The comment suggests Fibonacci numbers are integers less than or equal to 0, but the annotation enforces 'greater than or equal to 0' (ge=0), which is inconsistent. The comment appears to be incorrect or misleading.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type annotation tools and Pydantic for data validation. It defines a type alias 'SequenceNumber' as an integer with a minimum value of 0. The comment above indicates Fibonacci numbers are 'Int and x <= 0,' which conflicts with the actual validation constraint 'ge=0'. The code itself does not include any malicious constructs or suspicious behaviors; it is simply a type alias with a validation rule. The discrepancy in the comment appears to be a documentation error rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a straightforward type alias definition with validation, containing no malicious behavior. The conflicting comment is likely an error or oversight. No security risks or malware are present.",
