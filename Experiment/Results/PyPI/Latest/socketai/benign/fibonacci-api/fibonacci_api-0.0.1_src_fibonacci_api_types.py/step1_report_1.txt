{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias for Fibonacci sequence numbers with validation constraints",
  "sources": "The code imports 'Annotated' from 'typing' and 'Field' from 'pydantic', then defines a type alias",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data output, no external system interaction",
  "flows": "No data flow involving external inputs or outputs; purely static type annotation",
  "anomalies": "The comment suggests Fibonacci sequence numbers are integers less than or equal to 0, but the code enforces 'ge=0' (greater than or equal to 0), which is contradictory and potentially a logic anomaly",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for type annotation and data validation, then creates a type alias 'SequenceNumber' for integers annotated with a Pydantic 'Field' constraint. The comment indicates a misunderstanding or mistake, as it states Fibonacci numbers are 'Int and x <= 0', yet the code applies 'ge=0', which contradicts the comment. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior; the code is straightforward type annotation with validation. No external inputs or outputs are involved, and the code does not perform any actions beyond static definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static type alias with validation constraints, with a contradictory comment. It does not contain malicious behavior or security issues. The inconsistency appears to be a documentation or comment error, not malicious intent.",
