  "purpose": "Define a type alias for sequence numbers using Pydantic's Annotated type with a constraint.",
  "sources": "import statements from typing and pydantic modules",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or between components",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The comment about Fibonacci sequence is inconsistent with the actual code, which only enforces non-negative integers, not Fibonacci numbers.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a type alias 'SequenceNumber' as an Annotated int with a field constraint enforcing 'greater than or equal to 0'. The comment suggesting Fibonacci sequence numbers are int and less than or equal to 0 is inconsistent with the implementation, which only constrains the value to be non-negative. No source or sink of untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be straightforward type annotation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple type alias with a constraint, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The comment appears to be inaccurate or misleading but does not impact security.",
