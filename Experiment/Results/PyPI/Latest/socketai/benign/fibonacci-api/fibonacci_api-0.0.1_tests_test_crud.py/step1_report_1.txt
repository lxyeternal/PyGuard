{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the 'crud' module of a Fibonacci API, validating Fibonacci calculations and pagination functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest and hypothesis libraries, reading test inputs and parameters, and calling functions from 'crud' module.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and exception handling that depend on the output of 'crud' functions; no external data or untrusted input processed beyond test parameters.",
  "flows": "Test inputs are fed into 'crud.calculate_fibonacci' and 'crud.get_page'; results are checked via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be standard test code for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code uses pytest and hypothesis for testing Fibonacci calculations and pagination logic. It calls functions from 'crud' but does not include any code that processes external data or network activity. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious data handling are present. The test functions only verify expected outputs and exception handling. There are no hidden backdoors, data leaks, or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for a Fibonacci API module with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks identified. It is safe and does not contain malware or security threats.",
