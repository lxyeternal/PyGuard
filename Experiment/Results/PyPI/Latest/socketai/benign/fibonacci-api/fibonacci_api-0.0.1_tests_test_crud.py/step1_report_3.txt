{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'crud' module in 'fibonacci_api', specifically testing Fibonacci calculation and pagination functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pytest, hypothesis, and the 'crud' module; test input parameters; data returned by 'crud.calculate_fibonacci' and 'crud.get_page'.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on function outputs; potential exceptions raised during invalid input testing.",
  "flows": "Input data is fed into 'crud.calculate_fibonacci' and 'crud.get_page'; outputs are verified through assertions; no untrusted data flows into sensitive functions or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns detected. The tests are straightforward and standard for unit testing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of parameterized tests for Fibonacci calculation and pagination functions, with input validation checks. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The tests rely solely on input-output assertions for the 'crud' functions. Import statements and test cases are standard and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign set of unit tests for the 'crud' module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
