{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the 'crud' module, specifically testing Fibonacci calculations and pagination functions.",
  "sources": "Test input parameters and function calls within the test functions; no external data sources or network interactions.",
  "sinks": "Assertions verifying function outputs; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'crud' functions; outputs are compared against expected values via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward testing logic with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of parameterized and property-based tests for 'crud' functions, with no external dependencies, network activity, or handling of sensitive data. It performs input validation, correctness checks, and pagination tests. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code structure and assertions are standard for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
