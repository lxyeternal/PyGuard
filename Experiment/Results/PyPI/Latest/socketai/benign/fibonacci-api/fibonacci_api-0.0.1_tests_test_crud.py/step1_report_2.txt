{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for a Fibonacci calculation API, verifying correctness and behavior of functions within the 'crud' module.",
  "sources": "Test inputs for 'calculate_fibonacci' and 'get_page' functions, including parametrize data, and hypothesis-generated integers.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on function outputs; no direct untrusted data sinks, no external network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Test inputs flow into 'crud.calculate_fibonacci' and 'crud.get_page' functions, with outputs compared against expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs parameterized and property-based testing of 'calculate_fibonacci' and 'get_page'. Inputs are statically defined or generated by hypothesis. Tests verify correctness and handle invalid input cases. There are no apparent malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. Usage of testing frameworks and assertions is standard. No network, file I/O, or sensitive data handling is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard test suite for a Fibonacci API, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It strictly tests functionality without interacting with external systems or sensitive data.",
