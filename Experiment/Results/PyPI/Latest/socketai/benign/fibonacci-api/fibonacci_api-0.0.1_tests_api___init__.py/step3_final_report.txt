  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Code imports, environment variables, input functions, external files, network operations, system calls.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file I/O, system commands, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into functions that could lead to network or file operations, but no explicit flows are confirmed in the provided snippets.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected; code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code presence, with high confidence levels (0.8-0.9) in benign assessments. Malware scores are consistently 0, and security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting cautious but justified evaluations. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified. The absence of code in some reports limits analysis, but the reasoning remains sound. The scores align with the evidence, and no indications of supply chain attacks or malicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets and reports collectively suggest benign, non-obfuscated Python code with no malicious intent. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the observations. No further action or suspicion is warranted based on current data.",
