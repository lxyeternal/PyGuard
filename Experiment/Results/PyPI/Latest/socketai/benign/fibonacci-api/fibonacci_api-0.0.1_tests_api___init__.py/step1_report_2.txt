  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or system interaction, but the specific intent cannot be determined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, input functions, and possibly external files or network connections (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network transmissions, or file writes, which could be exploited if they process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or input functions to sinks such as system commands, network calls, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are observed in the provided code. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks any complex or unusual constructs. It uses standard Python functions and libraries without suspicious modifications. No backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious logic such as data exfiltration, unauthorized network connections, or system damage are detected. Without additional context or external code, no malicious behavior is apparent. The code's purpose seems benign based on the given snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, non-malicious Python script. However, the assessment is limited to the provided code snippet; full confidence requires examining the complete codebase.",
