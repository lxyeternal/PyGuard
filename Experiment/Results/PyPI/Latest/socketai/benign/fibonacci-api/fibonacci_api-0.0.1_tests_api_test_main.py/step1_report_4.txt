{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for a FastAPI application related to Fibonacci calculations and blocking sequence numbers.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from URL parameters in GET and PATCH requests, particularly the Fibonacci number and sequence number.",
  "sinks": "Response content is decoded and checked; the code calls an external function 'calculate_fibonacci' but does not directly write or execute untrusted data in a malicious way.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from URL are used in requests; responses are validated but do not influence system state beyond standard API behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of property access for API versioning appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard testing frameworks (pytest, FastAPI TestClient) to perform API endpoint testing. It imports application modules and calls functions like 'calculate_fibonacci', which seem to be standard and not malicious. The use of 'hypothesis' for property-based testing is typical and not suspicious. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious payloads. No hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors are present. All inputs are validated via assertions, and no dangerous code paths are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of API tests for a Fibonacci-related application with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard in structure, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
