{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for a FastAPI application related to Fibonacci calculations and blocking sequence numbers.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from URL parameters and test inputs (e.g., sequence_number), and performs GET and PATCH requests to the API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "API endpoints perform actions like retrieving Fibonacci numbers and blocking sequence numbers; potential data leaks could occur if inputs are mishandled, but no sensitive data is processed or leaked in this code.",
  "flows": "Test inputs (sequence_number) are sent via HTTP requests to the API, which then processes these inputs in the backend functions (not shown here), likely passing them to the 'crud' module for calculation or state modification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. Usage of property access, API testing, and a property from the 'crud' module appears standard. No obfuscation or suspicious code features are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward API endpoint testing using FastAPI's TestClient. It verifies response codes and content correctness for GET and PATCH requests. No dynamic code execution, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is evident. The 'crud' module is used for calculation, which is typical. There are no signs of malicious or maliciously intended code. Inputs are validated via the testing framework, and no insecure practices are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate test suite for a Fibonacci-related API, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard testing code with no apparent malicious intent or security issues.",
