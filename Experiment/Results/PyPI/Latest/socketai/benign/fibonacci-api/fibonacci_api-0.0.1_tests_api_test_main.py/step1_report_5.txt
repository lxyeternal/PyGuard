{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for a FastAPI application, testing endpoints related to Fibonacci calculations and blocklist management.",
  "sources": "Reads data from HTTP request parameters, response content, and imported modules/functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include assertions on response status codes and JSON content; no untrusted data is written or executed.",
  "flows": "Input data (URL parameters) flows into API endpoints; responses are checked for correctness; no data flows into insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard testing practices for FastAPI endpoints with no signs of malicious payloads or suspicious operations. It reads data from HTTP requests and responses, but does not handle or process untrusted data beyond normal validation. The use of third-party testing libraries is standard. There are no backdoors, malicious code, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms. The functions are straightforward and serve to verify the API's correctness. Overall, the code appears to be a benign test suite.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test suite for API endpoints with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard validation of responses and API functionality without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
