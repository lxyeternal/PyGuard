{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for a FastAPI application related to Fibonacci calculations and blocking certain sequence numbers.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests to '/' and '/fibonacci/{number}', PATCH requests to '/fibonacci/block/{number}', data inputs are the URL parameters and test data generated by hypothesis.",
  "sinks": "Response handling and assertions, interaction with 'crud.calculate_fibonacci' function.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from URL (e.g., 'fibonacci/{fibonacci_val}', 'fibonacci/block/{sequence_number}') are used directly in API requests; responses are validated, and 'crud.calculate_fibonacci' is called with input values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed. The code uses standard testing libraries and straightforward API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API testing using FastAPI's TestClient, with input data generated via hypothesis. It tests root endpoint, Fibonacci calculation, and blocking a sequence number. Calls to 'crud.calculate_fibonacci' use user-controlled input, but this is part of normal operation; no unsafe data handling or injection points are evident. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions serve testing purposes, with no external data exfiltration or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for a Fibonacci API with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The security risk is minimal and confined to normal testing procedures.",
