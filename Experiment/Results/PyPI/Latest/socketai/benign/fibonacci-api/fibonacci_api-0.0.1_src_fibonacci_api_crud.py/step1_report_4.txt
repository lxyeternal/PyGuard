  "purpose": "This code provides functions for calculating Fibonacci numbers, managing a block list of sequence numbers, and paginating results, primarily for use in an API.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the `n` parameter in `get_fibonacci`, `sequence_number` in various functions, and query parameters for pagination (`page`, `limit`). Data is read from the `_block.SEQUENCE_NUMBER_BLOCK_LIST` set.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies `_block.SEQUENCE_NUMBER_BLOCK_LIST` (adding/removing sequence numbers). It raises exceptions on blocked sequence numbers and returns Fibonacci calculations. No direct data leaks or unsafe outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (`n`, `sequence_number`, `page`, `limit`) flow into functions which perform validation and data access. Block list checks prevent access to blocked numbers, and the Fibonacci calculation flows from input to output, with caching used. Block list modifications flow from the update and delete functions to the shared block list.",
  "anomalies": "Use of the `@cache` decorator on a recursive Fibonacci function may lead to high memory use, but this is standard caching. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code appears straightforward without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Fibonacci calculations with memoization, manages a block list, and implements pagination. It checks if a number is blocked before processing, raising a custom exception. Block list management functions modify a shared set, with add, remove, and clear operations. There are no external network communications, no data exfiltration, or suspicious data handling. The exception handling is typical. The only potential concern is the use of `@cache` on a recursive Fibonacci, which could lead to excessive memory use, but this does not imply malicious intent. No obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for Fibonacci calculation and block list management with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles input validation and data management securely, without evident malicious intent.",
