{
  "purpose": "The code provides CRUD operations for managing a block list of sequence numbers and calculating Fibonacci numbers, with some access control via block list checks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (n, item, page, limit, sequence_number) and the block list stored in _block.SEQUENCE_NUMBER_BLOCK_LIST.",
  "sinks": "The block list is modified or accessed, and Fibonacci calculations are performed. No external data sinks are evident, nor are there network or file I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to compute Fibonacci numbers while checking against the block list; functions update, retrieve, or clear the block list accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses caching for Fibonacci calculations, which is standard. The block list management involves in-place modifications with |= and remove(), but no suspicious or hidden behavior is immediately visible. No hardcoded credentials or secret data is present. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and handles Fibonacci calculations with memoization, while managing a block list to prevent certain sequence numbers from being fetched. Block list operations include addition, removal, retrieval, and clearing, implemented with set operations. No external network calls or data leaks are present. The functions are well-structured; no suspicious data flows or malicious code are detected. The only potential concern is if the block list is manipulated unexpectedly, but this is typical for such functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of Fibonacci sequence calculation combined with a simple block list management system. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is transparent, and its logic is clear without hidden or suspicious patterns.",
