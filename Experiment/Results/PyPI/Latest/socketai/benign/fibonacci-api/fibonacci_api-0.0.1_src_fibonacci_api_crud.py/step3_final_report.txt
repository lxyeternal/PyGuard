  "purpose": "Manage Fibonacci sequence calculations and maintain a block list of sequence numbers.",
  "sources": "Input sequence number `n` in `calculate_fibonacci`, sequence numbers added or removed via block list functions.",
  "sinks": "The `get_fibonacci` function raises exceptions if `n` is on the block list; `calculate_fibonacci` computes values internally.",
  "flows": "Input `n` -> `get_fibonacci` (checks block list) -> `calculate_fibonacci` (recursive calculation) -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Use of naive recursion could cause resource exhaustion but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Fibonacci calculations with caching, manages a block list via set operations, and handles exceptions properly. No external network or file I/O is present. The recursive Fibonacci with caching is inefficient but benign. The block list is manipulated via set operations with no suspicious patterns. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential resource exhaustion from recursion, but this is a performance concern, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The low security risk score is appropriate, with the potential for resource exhaustion being a non-malicious performance issue. Overall, the code is safe for use.",
