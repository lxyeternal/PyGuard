{
  "purpose": "Provides CRUD-like operations for managing a block list and calculating Fibonacci sequence numbers with some pagination and validation.",
  "sources": "Reads sequence numbers from function parameters, environment (_block.SEQUENCE_NUMBER_BLOCK_LIST), and external inputs in function calls.",
  "sinks": "Accesses and modifies _block.SEQUENCE_NUMBER_BLOCK_LIST, calls cache, raises exceptions, and performs recursion for Fibonacci calculation.",
  "flows": "Input sequence numbers are validated against _block.SEQUENCE_NUMBER_BLOCK_LIST; Fibonacci calculations are performed, and list modifications occur based on sequence numbers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of recursive Fibonacci may cause performance issues, but no malicious obfuscation. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs Fibonacci calculations with caching, manages a block list for sequence numbers, and provides pagination. It uses a cache decorator to optimize Fibonacci calculations, and includes exception handling for blocked sequence numbers. The block list management functions modify a shared set, but do not contain any malicious code or external data exfiltration mechanisms. No suspicious code patterns or data leaks are evident. The code does not perform any network operations or system modifications that could be malicious. It appears to be a legitimate utility for managing blocked sequence numbers and calculating Fibonacci numbers.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, focused on managing a block list and calculating Fibonacci numbers with no signs of malicious intent or malware. No malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or malicious obfuscation is detected.",
