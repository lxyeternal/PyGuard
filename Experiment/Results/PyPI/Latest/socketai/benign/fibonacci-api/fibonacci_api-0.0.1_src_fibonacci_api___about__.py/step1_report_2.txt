  "anomalies": "Presence of SPDX license identifiers, which are standard and not suspicious; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments indicating SPDX license and copyright, and a version string assignment. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The license identifiers are standard for open-source projects and do not indicate malicious intent. The version string is a simple variable assignment. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, standard metadata declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of an open-source package.",
