  "purpose": "Metadata declaration including SPDX license identifiers, copyright info, and version string.",
  "sources": "Comments containing license and copyright information, and the __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static metadata only.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal static file with license comments and a version string assignment. It contains no input, output, data processing, or dynamic code. All reports correctly identify it as benign metadata-only content. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate given the static, non-executable nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign metadata header with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
