  "purpose": "Declare license and version information for the Python package/module.",
  "sources": "SPDX license identifier, copyright comment, version variable assignment",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows; static metadata declaration",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only metadata comments and variable assignment, no suspicious activity or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of SPDX license comments, a copyright statement, and a version variable assignment. No input/output operations, no network activity, no dynamic code execution. The license comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The version variable is a typical practice for package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as metadata for licensing and versioning purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
