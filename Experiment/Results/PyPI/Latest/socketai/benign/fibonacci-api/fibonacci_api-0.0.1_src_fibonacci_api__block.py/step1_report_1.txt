  "purpose": "Internal module to namespace block list.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'fibonacci_api.types' and the creation of an empty set for block listing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code only initializes a set.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific type 'SequenceNumber' and initializes an empty set intended for blocking certain sequence numbers. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No suspicious or malicious activities are evident. The code appears to serve as a simple namespace or placeholder for managing blocked sequence numbers, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign internal module for maintaining a block list. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
