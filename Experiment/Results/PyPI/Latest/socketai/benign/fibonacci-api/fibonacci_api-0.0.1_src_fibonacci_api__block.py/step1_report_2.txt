  "purpose": "Internal module to namespace block list.",
  "sources": "Imports from external module 'fibonacci_api.types' and the definition of an empty set.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines a set.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with standard import and variable initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a type 'SequenceNumber' from an external module, then initializes an empty set of that type. There are no data manipulations, input handling, or untrusted data flows. The code appears to serve as a namespace or configuration container. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. The code structure and content are simple and typical for a module defining a block list.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign internal module that initializes an empty set for blocking sequence numbers. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
