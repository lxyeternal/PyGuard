  "purpose": "Define an internal module that manages a block list of sequence numbers.",
  "sources": "Import of SequenceNumber from an external module, initialization of an empty set.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific type from a module, then initializes an empty set to serve as a block list. There are no data inputs, no processing, and no outputs or network operations. The simplicity and clarity suggest standard functionality for namespace management of blocked sequence numbers. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign internal module used for managing a block list. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and serves a clear purpose within the larger codebase.",
