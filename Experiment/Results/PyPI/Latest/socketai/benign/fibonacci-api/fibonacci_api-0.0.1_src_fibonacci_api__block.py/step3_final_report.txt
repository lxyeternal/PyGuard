  "purpose": "Internal module to namespace block list.",
  "sources": "Import of SequenceNumber type from fibonacci_api.types; initialization of an empty set SEQUENCE_NUMBER_BLOCK_LIST",
  "sinks": "No data flows, input/output, or external interactions present",
  "flows": "None; static code with no data flow",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a type and defines an empty set, serving as a namespace or placeholder. No dynamic behavior, data processing, or external interactions are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static internal module with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's simplicity. It poses no security risks.",
