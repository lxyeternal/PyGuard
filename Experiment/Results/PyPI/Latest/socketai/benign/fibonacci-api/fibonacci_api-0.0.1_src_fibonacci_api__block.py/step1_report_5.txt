  "purpose": "Define an internal namespace for a block list of sequence numbers used in the fibonacci_api module.",
  "sources": "The import statement from fibonacci_api.types and the assignment to SEQUENCE_NUMBER_BLOCK_LIST.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific type, SequenceNumber, and initializes an empty set to hold blocked sequence numbers. There are no input or output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted data. The code appears to be a straightforward internal setup for maintaining a block list, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign internal module that sets up an empty set for block listing sequence numbers. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
