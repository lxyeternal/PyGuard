  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for API error handling and a utility function to render error paths as strings.",
  "sources": "Static class definitions and the 'render_path' function formatting a list of path elements.",
  "sinks": "Error message formatting via string concatenation; no external data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Error details and path information flow into exception messages, potentially logged or displayed.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward, standard, and lacks dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of custom exception classes and a helper function for error path rendering, generated by OpenAPI tools. It does not process untrusted data or execute code, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. The error message formatting is safe, with minimal risk of information leakage if logs are exposed, but this is a common and acceptable aspect of error handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception handling utility with no malicious or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are accurate; I recommend maintaining malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 to reflect the minimal potential for info leakage if error logs are insecurely stored.",
