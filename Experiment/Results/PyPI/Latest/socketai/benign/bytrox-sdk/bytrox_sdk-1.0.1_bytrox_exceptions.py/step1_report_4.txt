{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling API errors and type/value/key errors in an OpenAPI client context.",
  "sources": "No external input reading; exception classes are instantiated with parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; exception messages are formatted strings based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; exception message formatting is straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions, with methods for detailed error messages. The render_path function converts a list of path elements into a string representation. There is no dynamic execution, input handling, or network activity. The code strictly manages error information formatting without external data input or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a structured exception handling module for an API client. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leakage, and no security risks. It is a standard, non-malicious implementation for error management in a Python API client.",
