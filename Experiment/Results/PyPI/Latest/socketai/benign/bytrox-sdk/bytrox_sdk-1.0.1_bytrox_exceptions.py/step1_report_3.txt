  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various API errors and provide utility functions for rendering error paths.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading; only class definitions and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines classes and functions for error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code uses standard exception handling and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for API error handling, including detailed error messages with path rendering. No data processing, external calls, or untrusted data handling present. The utility function render_path formats error locations; it is straightforward and does not perform any risky operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes and a helper function for rendering error paths. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and poses no security risks.",
