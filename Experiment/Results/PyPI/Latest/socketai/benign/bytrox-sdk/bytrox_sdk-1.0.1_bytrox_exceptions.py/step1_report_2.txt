{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and a utility function for handling and rendering errors related to OpenAPI validation and responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads exception messages, error data, and HTTP response data from objects and parameters provided to constructors and functions.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs error message strings that include data from exception objects and HTTP responses, potentially exposing internal data if these exceptions are logged or displayed.",
  "flows": "Exception data and HTTP response information flow from object attributes and constructor parameters into formatted error messages, which could be outputted or logged.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code uses standard exception handling and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The script defines exception classes for handling OpenAPI-related errors, including type, value, key errors, and general API exceptions. Each class captures error details and formats messages. The 'render_path' function creates string representations of data paths, used in error messages. The code relies on standard libraries and follows typical patterns for error handling. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks. No external input handling or network activity is present that could be exploited. Overall, the code appears to be standard error handling utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a utility for structured error handling in an OpenAPI context. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. Its design is straightforward and secure.",
