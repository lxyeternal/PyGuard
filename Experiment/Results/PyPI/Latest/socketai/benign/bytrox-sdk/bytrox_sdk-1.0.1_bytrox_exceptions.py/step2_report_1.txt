  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines exception classes and a utility for rendering error paths.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Static class definitions; no untrusted data processing or external data handling.\n- Anomalies: None detected; code is standard.\n- Analysis: The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution or malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign, standard exception handling code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar exception classes with error message formatting.\n- Sinks/Flows: Error data could be logged or displayed, but no malicious intent.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard pattern; no malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Safe utility functions.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the slight securityRisk is acceptable given the potential for error message exposure, but no actual vulnerability exists.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data processing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard, safe implementation.\n- Conclusion: No security issues.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Similar exception classes.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same pattern.\n- Analysis: No suspicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware=0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected; obfuscated=0 is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Given that the code only handles exceptions and error message formatting, and no untrusted data is processed in a way that could cause security vulnerabilities, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is appropriate. The slight securityRisk=0.1 in one report is acceptable but could be reduced to 0 for consistency.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely for exception handling and error message formatting.\n- No code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data in a risky manner.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The only potential concern is error message exposure, but that is a common and acceptable aspect of error handling.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of exception classes and a utility function for rendering error paths, with no malicious or security-compromising features. The current scores are accurate, but I would recommend setting the overall risk score to 0 for clarity.",
