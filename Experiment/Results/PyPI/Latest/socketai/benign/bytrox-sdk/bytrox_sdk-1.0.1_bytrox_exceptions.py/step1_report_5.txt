{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling API errors and errors related to data validation and type checking in an OpenAPI-generated client.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code relies on exception handling and rendering paths within internal logic.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; exception messages are generated from internal variables and passed data, not directly from user input.",
  "flows": "Errors are raised and formatted internally; no data flow from external sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The code primarily manages exceptions and error messages.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for use in an OpenAPI client context, including handling of type errors, value errors, key errors, and general API exceptions. It includes functions to render error paths for debugging or logging. The implementation uses standard exception handling patterns and safe string formatting. No external data input is processed directly, and no suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
