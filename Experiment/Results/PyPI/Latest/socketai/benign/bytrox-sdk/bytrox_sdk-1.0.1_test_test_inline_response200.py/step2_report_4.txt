  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, auto-generated unit test scaffold for the `InlineResponse200` data model.\n- The code only creates instances with static string values ('0') for various wallet-related fields.\n- No external inputs, network communication, file operations, or data handling are present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are detected.\n- The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0.\n\n**Confirming the Code:**\n- The code is a standard test class generated by OpenAPI tools.\n- It only constructs data objects with hardcoded values.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n**Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign and typical for auto-generated tests.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The use of placeholder '0' strings is standard for test scaffolds and does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly 0. No malicious activity or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0. No obfuscation or code hiding techniques.\n- **Risk Score:** Correctly 0. The code is purely for testing, with no security implications.\n\n**Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n- The reports assume static, placeholder data does not pose security risks. This is valid.\n- No assumptions about external inputs or dynamic code execution are made, which is correct.\n\n**Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n- All scores align with the code's nature.\n- The conclusion that the code is safe and benign is justified.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- I agree with the reports' findings.\n- No changes needed; the code is safe, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, generated unit test scaffold with no malicious or security concern. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
