{
  "purpose": "This code is a generated unit test scaffold for the 'InlineResponse200' data model, intended to verify object instantiation with optional and required parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values ('0') assigned to class attributes during object creation.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not process external input or perform network/file operations.",
  "flows": "The source flows into object instantiation with hardcoded values; no further data flow or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated unit test class that creates instances of a data model with static placeholder values. It contains no external data input, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The code structure is simple and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. All signals point to benign, safe code typical of generated test scaffolds.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a simple test stub for data model instantiation. All reports' assessments and scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
