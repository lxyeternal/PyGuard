  "purpose": "Generated unit test scaffold for an OpenAPI client, intended to test API interactions related to wallet creation.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'openapi_client.api._____api' (placeholder), class instantiation of API client, and placeholder test method.",
  "sinks": "No data output, network calls, or data processing present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of API client from imported module; no data flow beyond class creation.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder module name '_____api' indicating incomplete or template-generated code; no active logic or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, autogenerated test scaffold with no active data flow, network activity, or malicious behavior. The placeholder '_____api' suggests incomplete code but not malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores of malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0 are appropriate; the low risk score (~0.1) reflects the incomplete nature but no actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, a typical autogenerated API test stub with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The placeholder module name indicates incompleteness but not malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate and no further action is necessary.",
