  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a generated unit test stub for an OpenAPI client, with import statements indicating a placeholder module ('_____api') and a test method for 'invoice_create_wallet_post'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data output, network calls, or data processing are present.\n- **Anomalies:** The placeholder '_____api' suggests incomplete or template-generated code, but this is typical in generated stubs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard, harmless test scaffold with no malicious behavior. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1 (very low, mainly due to placeholder nature).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that it's an autogenerated API test scaffold with no active data or network activity.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns observed.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also confirms that it's a generated test setup with no data processing or external calls.\n- Placeholder '_____api' indicates incomplete code but not malicious.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates that this is a standard autogenerated test stub with no data flow or malicious activity.\n- No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar findings: a boilerplate test scaffold with no actual test logic, data handling, or network activity.\n- No signs of malicious intent.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a generated test scaffold, with no active data flow, network activity, or malicious operations.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low, mainly due to the placeholder module name indicating incomplete code, not malicious intent.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, generated, and unobfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, autogenerated API test scaffold with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening content. The placeholder '_____api' suggests incomplete code but not malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- No further action needed.",
