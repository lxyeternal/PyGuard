  "purpose": "This code initializes an SDK for the Bytrox API, importing various modules, classes, and exceptions necessary for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, standard library, and bytrox package modules (api, api_client, configuration, exceptions, models).",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; no data leaks or network actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up imports and configuration for API usage.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected. The initial comments indicate generated code with no custom logic.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of import statements and metadata comments. There are no functions, data handling, or dynamic code execution present. The code appears to be standard boilerplate generated by an API client generator, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is boilerplate SDK setup with no malicious intent or security threats detected. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or other potentially harmful actions.",
