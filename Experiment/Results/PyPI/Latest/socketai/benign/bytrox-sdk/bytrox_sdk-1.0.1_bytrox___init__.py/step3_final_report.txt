{
  "purpose": "This code is a generated SDK setup module for the 'bytrox' API, primarily consisting of import statements, version info, and comments. It serves to initialize the SDK environment and import necessary components.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'bytrox' modules, version declaration, and comments; no runtime data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output; the code does not process or transmit untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and does not execute dynamic logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static SDK boilerplate generated by OpenAPI tools. It contains only import statements, version info, and comments, with no runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk score reflects the benign, static nature of the code. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the risk score is very low, consistent with the code's purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, generated SDK initialization file with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
