  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and overall security risk, and verify if the reports' conclusions are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a generated SDK module, importing local or installed dependencies from 'bytrox'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing, network calls, or untrusted input handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard SDK boilerplate with no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal (0.1), justified by the lack of dynamic or external data handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; static import statements for SDK setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks or data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard generated code, safe and benign.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is appropriate. The security risk is zero, aligning with the static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Imports from 'bytrox' modules, typical SDK setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly boilerplate, safe, and without malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identified as benign, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Imports from various 'bytrox' modules, standard SDK initialization.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks or dynamic code.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is static, generated, and safe.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is justified. Security risk is low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others; setting up SDK with imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard boilerplate, safe.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is appropriate, with no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate a score of 0, which is consistent with the static, generated SDK code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports report 0, correctly identifying no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** All are very low (0 or close), justified given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is purely boilerplate SDK setup code, generated by OpenAPI tools, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the minimal inherent risk in SDK setup, but effectively negligible)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and poses no security threat.",
