  "purpose": "This code initializes imports and versioning for a Python SDK generated by OpenAPI Generator, setting up API modules, exceptions, models, and configurations for use.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, exceptions, and models from the bytrox package and its submodules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external network calls are present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; purely import and setup code",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code only performs static import statements to set up a client SDK environment, with no runtime data processing or external communication. It references version info, imports models, exceptions, and API components in a straightforward manner. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The comments and structure suggest standard SDK boilerplate code generated by OpenAPI tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code and only performs safe, static imports.",
