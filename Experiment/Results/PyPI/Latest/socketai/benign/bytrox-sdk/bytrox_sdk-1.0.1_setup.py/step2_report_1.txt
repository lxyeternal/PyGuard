  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes a standard setup configuration.\n- Findings: No suspicious code, no data flows from untrusted sources, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- Malware score: 0 — aligns with the findings.\n- Risk score: 0 — justified, as the code is purely for packaging.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, standard packaging.\n- Findings: No suspicious behavior, no code injection, no network activity, dependencies are benign.\n- Malware score: 0 — consistent.\n- Security risk: 0.1 — possibly slightly overestimating, but given the code's benign nature, this is acceptable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: Standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same.\n- Findings: Standard, no anomalies.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same.\n- Findings: No malicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\nThe code is a typical Python `setup.py` script used for packaging. It reads static data, defines package metadata, and does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or connect to networks. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary. The package setup code is safe and standard.",
