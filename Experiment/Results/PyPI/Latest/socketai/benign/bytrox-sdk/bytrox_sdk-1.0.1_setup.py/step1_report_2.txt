  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the Bytrox SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, reading README.md content.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setup() configuration",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors. Usage of external dependencies appears legitimate and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration, using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and package data. All inputs are static or configuration files, with no user input or untrusted data sources. The dependencies listed are typical for a Python SDK and do not suggest malicious behavior. No code execution, network calls, or data processing that could indicate malicious activity. The code appears straightforward and intended for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a conventional setup script for a Python SDK package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
