  "flows": "Reading package metadata and README content; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a standard setup script with no unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package metadata, reads the README.md file for a long description, and calls setup() with these parameters. All actions are standard for Python package setup, with no dynamic code execution, no reading of untrusted input, and no suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It does not contain any malware or obfuscated code. Overall, it appears safe and straightforward.",
