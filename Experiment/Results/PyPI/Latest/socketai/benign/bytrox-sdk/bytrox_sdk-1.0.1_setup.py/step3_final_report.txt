  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a SDK library.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, reading README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script defining package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. It reads static data from a file and passes it to setup(). There are no dynamic inputs, no code injection, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The code structure is straightforward and standard for Python packaging. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is 0. The reports are accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
