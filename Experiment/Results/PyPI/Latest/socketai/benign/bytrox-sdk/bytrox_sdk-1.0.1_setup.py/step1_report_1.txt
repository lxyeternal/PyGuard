  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python SDK package for Bytrox API, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and README content from files.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute code dynamically.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (e.g., README.md) into variables used in setup().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard packaging libraries and defines package metadata and dependencies. It reads the README.md for long description. All operations are standard for package setup and contain no indications of malicious behavior. No code injection, network activity, or credential handling is present. No obfuscation or hidden code is present. The dependencies listed are common and benign. No suspicious code flows or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks.",
