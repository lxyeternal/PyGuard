  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup configuration with no malicious intent. The logic is sound, and no suspicious activity is detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (since the report's conclusion is that there's no risk). Given the lack of any issues, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The report's confidence is high, and the reasoning is solid. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly states that the script is standard and benign. The mention of a security risk of 0.1 seems to be an overly cautious default, but since no actual issues are present, this should be 0.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The minimal security risk is justified as zero.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; the slight security risk assigned appears unwarranted. Recommend lowering securityRisk to 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No issues; the report's conclusion is appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical setup script with no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No concerns, consistent with previous reports.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; standard setup script, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly overestimated in some reports (e.g., 0.1), but given the context, a risk score of 0 is more accurate for benign setup scripts.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
