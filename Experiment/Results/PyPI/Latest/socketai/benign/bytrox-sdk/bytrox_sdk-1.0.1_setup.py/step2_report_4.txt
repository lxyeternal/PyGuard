  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup configuration with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly states that the script is a typical setup script with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — the securityRisk is slightly above zero, but since the code is benign, this might be an overestimation.\n- **Justification:** The risk score should reflect the absence of any actual security issues. A 0.1 risk score seems unnecessary here.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce securityRisk to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, correctly identifies benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Correct, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Correct, standard setup code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n- The only inconsistency is in Report 2, where the `securityRisk` is set to 0.1 despite no suspicious activity.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 across all reports, as there's no security risk.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
