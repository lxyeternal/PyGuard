{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Bytrox SDK package, including metadata, dependencies, and packaging instructions.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description; static strings for package metadata; dependency list in REQUIRES and EXTRAS.",
  "sinks": "None present; no handling of untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard for a setup script with clear package information and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package. It imports setup utilities, defines package metadata, reads a README file for the long description, and calls setup() with all relevant parameters. All operations involve static data or well-defined dependencies. There is no user input, network activity, or data processing that could be exploited. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It follows standard Python packaging practices without handling untrusted data or performing unsafe operations.",
