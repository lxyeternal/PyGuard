  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'passLastSem'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package metadata, including package data, README file content, and email author details.",
  "sinks": "None of the data sources directly lead to security-sensitive sinks or untrusted data handling within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The package data and README file are read during setup, but no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. Usage of standard setup tools and straightforward data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical Python package setup using setuptools, importing only standard libraries. It reads a README file for the long description, specifies package requirements, and sets package metadata. No external network connections, dynamic code execution, or data manipulation occurs. The author email and package data are static and do not present any security issues. The overall structure and content are typical for a Python package setup script, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe and typical for package distribution purposes.",
