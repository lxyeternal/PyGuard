  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library named 'passLastSem'.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, package files via find_packages(), and the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or sensitive data handling detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The only file read is 'README.md', which is part of standard package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses standard setup functions and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script. It imports setuptools, specifies package metadata, reads a README file for long description, and uses find_packages() to include all packages. No user input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external data fetched or transmitted. All functions and data are typical for a package distribution script.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a benign and standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
