  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'passLastSem' library, defining package metadata and reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sources": "Reads static 'README.md' file; uses find_packages() to include all packages; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network calls or data leaks; purely static file reading.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static data used for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, standard, and static; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools. It reads 'README.md' for long description, uses find_packages() for package inclusion, and sets package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or handling of untrusted input. All reports correctly identify the code as benign with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, standard nature of the script. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward and well-understood pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
