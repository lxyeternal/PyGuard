  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library named 'passLastSem'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'README.md' file via open('README.md').read().",
  "sinks": "The content read from 'README.md' is used in the 'long_description' parameter for package metadata.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'README.md' file (source) into the 'long_description' parameter (sink) during setup execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected. Use of standard 'setuptools' setup pattern; no hardcoded credentials or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python setuptools functions to configure package setup. It reads the README file for long description, which is typical. No input from untrusted sources besides a static file, and no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks identified.",
