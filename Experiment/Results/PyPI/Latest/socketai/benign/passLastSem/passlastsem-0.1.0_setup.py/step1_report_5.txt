{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'passLastSem'.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from 'README.md' for the long description and from the import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that handle untrusted data or untrusted inputs; no network, file write, or environment manipulation detected.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading 'README.md' content during setup, which is a controlled, static file read operation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code follows standard setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to define package metadata. It reads 'README.md' for the long description, a common practice. No dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no suspicious behaviors are present. All data sources are static files or imports, and no sinks or flows indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign setup configuration.",
