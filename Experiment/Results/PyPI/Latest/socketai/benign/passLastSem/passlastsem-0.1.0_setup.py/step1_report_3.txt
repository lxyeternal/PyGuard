  "purpose": "Configure the packaging and distribution settings for a Python library called 'passLastSem'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file to obtain the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present. The code does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "Reads from the 'README.md' file and passes this content into the 'long_description' parameter during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; standard setup configuration. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It specifies package metadata, reads a README file for the long description, and sets classifiers. There are no external network calls, no code execution, and no handling of sensitive information beyond standard metadata. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
