  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the provided code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It determines the package directory via `__file__`.\n- It defines a helper function `_load_text_file(filename)` that reads a text file from the package directory with UTF-8 encoding.\n- It loads two files, `'ass1.txt'` and `'ass2.txt'`, into variables `ass1` and `ass2`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Load and expose text files.\n- Analysis: No suspicious behavior; standard file I/O.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (very low, likely due to the minor filename concern)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the straightforward nature of the code. The security risk score is low, which seems appropriate. The malware score is correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1.\n- Analysis: No suspicious activity; standard resource loading.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is benign. The confidence is 1.0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity; simple file reading.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent with the code. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as previous.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity; resource loading.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same.\n- Analysis: No suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple resource loader.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The filenames `'ass1.txt'` and `'ass2.txt'` are somewhat unusual but not malicious.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The security risk scores are very low, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:**  \n  The malware scores should remain at 0, as there's no malicious activity.  \n  The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.  \n  The risk scores are appropriately low; no change needed.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores:**  \n  Since the code only loads static files without any dynamic or external interactions, the risk is minimal. The minor filename concern does not elevate the risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect the minor filename concern, but still very low)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
