  "purpose": "The code loads text files from the package directory and exposes their contents as variables.",
  "sources": "The code reads files 'ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt' from the package directory.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations; no untrusted data is explicitly used as input to system commands or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The package directory path is determined, then specific text files are read and their contents assigned to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code only performs file reading.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper function to read text files from the package directory, then reads specific files and exposes their contents as variables. The process involves determining the directory based on the current file, then opening and reading two text files. No input from external or untrusted sources is used; the file names are hardcoded. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or security-sensitive actions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for loading text files into variables, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
