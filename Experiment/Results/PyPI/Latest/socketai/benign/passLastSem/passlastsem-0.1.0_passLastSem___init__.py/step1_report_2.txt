{
  "purpose": "Load and expose content of text files within the package directory for further use.",
  "sources": "Reading files using open() with filenames 'ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt' located in the package directory.",
  "targets": "No direct data sinks or external data transmission; primarily file reading operations.",
  "flows": "File names are used as inputs to load_text_file() which reads from the filesystem and assigns content to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code determines its package directory via __file__, then loads specific text files into variables. This is a standard pattern for including resource files within a package. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection detected. The operations are straightforward file reads, and there are no dynamic or unsafe code execution paths.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs simple resource file loading with no malicious intent or security risks. It is typical for package resource management and does not pose security threats.",
