  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code to verify the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Determines the package directory via `__file__`.\n- Defines a helper `_load_text_file` to read text files with UTF-8 encoding.\n- Loads two files, `'ass1.txt'` and `'ass2.txt'`, into variables.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- No input from untrusted sources.\n- No network activity, code injection, or dynamic execution.\n- Files are read from the package directory; filenames are hardcoded.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is straightforward resource loading.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate; straightforward resource loading.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 is slightly conservative; since there's no risk, it could be 0. However, the report is cautious, which is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correct; simple resource loading.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; benign code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3:\n- Same as above; consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4:\n- Same findings; straightforward resource loading.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Same as above; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0; code is clear and simple.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied, with one report giving 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0 for all is justified.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a straightforward resource loader.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The filenames, while unusual, do not imply malicious intent.\n- The scores should be consistent and reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are appropriate, with no need for adjustments. The code poses no security threat based on the provided information.",
