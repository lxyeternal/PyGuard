  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code determines its package directory via `__file__`.\n- It defines a helper function `_load_text_file` to read files with UTF-8 encoding.\n- It loads two files, `'ass1.txt'` and `'ass2.txt'`, into variables `ass1` and `ass2`.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The filenames are hardcoded and seem to be resource files.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues reported present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code loads static text files from the package directory into variables, with no suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Are there any errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent, accurate, and thorough in their analysis. They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1). These seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Since the code only reads static text files and performs no malicious actions, a malware score of 0 is justified.  \n  **All reports agree.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.  \n  **All reports correctly assign 0.**\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  The code doesn't process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain security-sensitive flaws. The minimal risk score (mostly 0 or 0.1) is appropriate.\n\n- **Purpose and reasoning:**  \n  The reports emphasize that the code is benign, resource-loading, and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Any points of contention or adjustments?\n- **Potential concern about filename naming (`ass1.txt`, `ass2.txt`):**  \n  While the reports mention that the filenames could be considered unusual or suspicious, this alone doesn't indicate malicious intent. It could be part of a test or resource files.\n\n- **Scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports suggest any reason to assign higher scores. The code is very simple and safe.\n\n- **Risk justification:**  \n  The code is safe; no justification is needed for higher risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on all reports and the code:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable for minimal resource loading)  \n\nThe scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward resource loader with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal resource access, but not security risk)\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the analysis is sound.",
