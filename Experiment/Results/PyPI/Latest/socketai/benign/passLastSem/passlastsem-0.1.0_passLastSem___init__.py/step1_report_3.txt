  "purpose": "The code loads text files from the package directory and exposes their content as variables.",
  "sources": "Reading files from the package directory using the open() function.",
  "sinks": "Reading files is generally safe; no sinks are present that process untrusted input in a harmful manner.",
  "flows": "The code reads files from the package directory into memory; no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward file reading.",
  "analysis": "The code determines its own directory and loads specific text files ('ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt') into variables. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. Its purpose appears to be simply loading static resources from the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard file loading operations without any malicious intent or security risks.",
