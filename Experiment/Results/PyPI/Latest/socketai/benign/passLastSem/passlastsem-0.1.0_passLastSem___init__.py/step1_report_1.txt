{
  "purpose": "Load and expose text files from the package directory as variables.",
  "sources": "Reading files from the package directory using open() with filenames 'ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt'.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations; no direct sink for untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "File paths are constructed from the package directory and filenames, then data is read into variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The filenames 'ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt' could be considered unusual or suspicious due to naming, but do not indicate malicious intent by themselves.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the package directory, then loads two text files into variables. It uses standard file I/O with specified encoding. There are no input validation, no user inputs, and no external network or system modifications. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of loading static text resources. There are no suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility to load static text files from the package directory. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident. The use of filename strings is standard; the only minor concern is the filename choice, but it does not indicate malicious intent.",
