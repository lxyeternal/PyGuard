  "purpose": "Load text files from the package directory and assign their contents to variables.",
  "sources": "Reading files using open() in _load_text_file function.",
  "sinks": "File read operations may be considered data input sources, but they are benign in this context.",
  "flows": "Function _load_text_file reads from files and assigns contents to variables 'ass1' and 'ass2'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper function to load text files relative to the package directory. It reads 'ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt' into variables. The implementation is straightforward and typical for reading package resources. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The code does not perform any unsafe operations, nor does it contain any obfuscated or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, intended solely for loading static text resources from the package directory. No malicious or security risks are evident.",
