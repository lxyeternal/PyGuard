  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Determines the package directory via `__file__`.\n- Defines a helper `_load_text_file()` to read files from that directory.\n- Loads 'ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt' into variables.\n- Uses standard file I/O with no input validation, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and performs static resource loading.\n\n- **Malicious behavior?**  \n  No. There is no network activity, no code injection, no data exfiltration, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is clear and simple.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. The code reads static files from its package directory; filenames are hardcoded but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Summary:** Correctly states the code loads text files; no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — reasonable, given the benign nature.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high, but slightly conservative.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Summary:** Correctly states straightforward resource loading; no suspicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — accurate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — very high.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Summary:** Same as above, consistent.\n- **Scores:** Both zero for malware and risk, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, benign resource loading.\n- **Scores:** Zero for malware and risk.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Summary:** Also consistent with benign file loading.\n- **Scores:** Zero for malware and risk.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities, a score of 0 or very close to it is appropriate. The highest given is 0.1, which seems reasonable.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, straightforward resource loading. The scores reflect this correctly.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the assessments are appropriate.",
