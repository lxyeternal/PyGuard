{
  "purpose": "The code determines its package directory via __file__, then loads two text files ('ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt') into variables, serving as resource loading functions.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'ass1.txt' and 'ass2.txt' from the package directory using open() with utf-8 encoding.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads static files from the package directory into variables without further processing or data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static resource loading with hardcoded filenames.",
  "analysis": "The code uses __file__ to locate its package directory, then defines a helper function to load text files with UTF-8 encoding. It loads two specific files into variables. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or handling of untrusted input. The filenames are hardcoded and static. The logic is simple and standard, with no suspicious patterns or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign resource loader with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs straightforward file reading operations from its package directory. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (around 0.1), reflecting minimal resource access without any security concerns.",
