{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'metascout' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long_description; static package metadata and dependencies; no untrusted input handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "None; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup.py script using setuptools. It reads a README file, specifies dependencies with platform-specific conditions, and defines entry points. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The dependencies are standard for a security analysis tool, and the code does not perform any dynamic or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The dependency choices are appropriate and do not introduce security risks. The minor security risk scores of 0.1 in some reports are overstated; the actual risk is negligible. All scores should be set to zero, reflecting the safe and straightforward nature of this package configuration.",
