{
  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for the 'metascout' Python package, specifying metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; specifies static package metadata and dependencies; defines console script entry point.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted input or data; no network, file, or system modifications performed here.",
  "flows": "Not applicable — this code only sets up package configuration, with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; no hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code; dependencies are standard, with platform-specific conditions properly handled.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It loads a README file, specifies package info, dependencies, optional extras, and entry points. Dependencies are clearly listed with platform conditions. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is well-structured and follows best practices for package setup. No runtime or data flow vulnerabilities are present in this configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious behaviors or obfuscation, and dependencies are typical for security-related tools.",
