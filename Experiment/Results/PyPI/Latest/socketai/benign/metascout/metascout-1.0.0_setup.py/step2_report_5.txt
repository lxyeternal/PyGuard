  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; standard setup.py reading README.md and defining dependencies.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dynamic or untrusted data processing.  \n- **Anomalies:** None detected.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Completely standard setup script with no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious dependencies.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0 — appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, code is straightforward.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard configuration, no issues.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, dependencies are typical.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — slightly above zero, possibly due to the general nature of security tools, but no concrete evidence of risk.  \n- **Justification for securityRisk=0.1:** The package is security-related, but the setup script itself is benign. The slight score may reflect the general security context, but it is not indicative of actual risk.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup configuration.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious indicators, dependencies are normal.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behaviors.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — similar to report 3, likely due to the nature of the package.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malware or obfuscation:** **None detected** in any report.  \n- **Dependency analysis:** All dependencies are standard, publicly available, and typical for security tools.  \n- **Suspicious patterns:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic.  \n- **Risk scores:** The securityRisk scores of 0.1 in some reports seem to reflect the package's security focus rather than actual vulnerabilities in the setup script itself. Since the setup script is benign, these should be lowered to 0.0 for consistency.\n\n### **Overall Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should be **0.0** across the board. No evidence of malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0.0**; no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Security risk score:** Given the benign nature of the setup script, should be **0.0**. The slight scores of 0.1 are unwarranted unless there is external context suggesting risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | **0.0**         |\n| Obfuscated         | **0.0**         |\n| Security Risk      | **0.0**         |\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe setup.py code is a standard, well-structured package configuration with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The dependencies are typical for a security analysis tool, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis package appears legitimate and safe. The current scores overstate the potential risk; they should all be reset to zero to accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.",
