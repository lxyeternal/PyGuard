  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'metascout', intended for metadata analysis and security tools.",
  "sources": "Reads from README.md file for long_description, user inputs are not directly read in this script, dependencies specified in install_requires and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks in this code; potential vulnerabilities could arise from dependencies or runtime behavior not shown here.",
  "flows": "No data flows indicating untrusted data processing; primarily static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in this setup script. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It reads a markdown file for description, specifies package info, dependencies, optional extras, and console entry points. All dependencies are publicly available packages; no suspicious or malicious dependencies are indicated. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual patterns. The code appears straightforward and well-structured for typical Python packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python security-related package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
