{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for the Python package 'metascout', including dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, package discovery via find_packages(), and specifying dependencies in install_requires and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks; the code primarily sets package metadata and dependencies without executing untrusted data or system commands.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow involving untrusted input to critical functions; configuration data flows from variables to setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code patterns, or suspicious configurations detected. The code follows standard packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including reading a README file and configuring dependencies and metadata. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling present. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The dependencies are typical for a security-oriented analysis tool. No anomalies or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python security analysis package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly handles package configuration without any suspicious code or external data flows.",
