      "conclusion": "The setup.py is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The dependency choices are appropriate and do not introduce security risks. The minor security risk scores of 0.1 in some reports are overstated; the actual risk is negligible. All scores should be set to zero, reflecting the safe and straightforward nature of this package configuration."

The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal risk score reflects the benign nature of the code. The primary concern remains the behavior of the external process_files() function, which cannot be assessed here but does not indicate malicious intent within this code snippet."
