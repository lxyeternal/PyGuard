  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence provided and the technical details.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code snippet is a minimalistic Python module, likely an `__init__.py` file, setting up exports and versioning for the MetaScout package.\n- All reports agree that the code contains only import statements, version info, and `__all__` definitions.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code patterns are identified.\n- The code is standard for package setup and export, with no signs of malware or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors?**  \n  None. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Any suggested score adjustments?**  \nNo. The scores seem appropriate and justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, indicating no concern.  \n- Given the evidence, this is correct. No elevated risk is warranted.\n\n### Malware considerations:\n- **Malware score of 0** is correct, as there is no malicious activity or code.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they rely on code structure and content analysis.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores and conclusions are consistent with the code snippet and the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign module setup for a Python package. No security concerns, malware, or obfuscation are present. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo further action needed. The code is safe, well-understood, and correctly scored.",
