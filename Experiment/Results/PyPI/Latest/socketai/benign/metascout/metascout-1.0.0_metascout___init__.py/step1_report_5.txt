{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the MetaScout file metadata analysis tool, including version info, module imports, and exported functions and classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .core.models, .cli, and .core.processor modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or network operations present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports modules and sets __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of metadata and import statements. It defines a version string, imports specific classes and functions from relative modules, and specifies exports. There are no data inputs, network operations, or code execution mechanisms present. The structure suggests this is a part of a larger project and is not malicious by itself. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This module functions as an initializer or interface declaration for the MetaScout tool. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard for a Python package's main module.",
