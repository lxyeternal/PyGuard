{
  "purpose": "This code defines a module for an advanced file metadata analysis tool called MetaScout, primarily setting up imports and exposing key functions and classes.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading occurs directly within this snippet. External data might be processed by imported functions, but not in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are visible in this snippet; actual data handling would occur within imported modules or functions called elsewhere.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows in this snippet, as it mainly contains import statements and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior are present. The code appears to be standard module setup with no embedded malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module definition for a Python package, importing specific classes and functions from submodules and defining __all__ for exports. It does not contain any code that reads input, processes data, or interacts with external systems directly. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code's structure suggests it is part of a larger, legitimate project.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and functions as a module setup for the MetaScout project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this snippet.",
