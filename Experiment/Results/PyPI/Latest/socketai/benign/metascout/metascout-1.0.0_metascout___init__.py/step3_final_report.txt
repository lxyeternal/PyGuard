  "purpose": "Module initialization and API exposure for the MetaScout package",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.core.models, .cli, .core.processor) and version string assignment",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution present",
  "flows": "Importing internal modules and exposing functions/classes via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for a package __init__.py",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package initializer, importing internal components and defining __all__ for public API. It contains no data processing, input/output, network activity, or dynamic execution. No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The structure and content are consistent with benign package setup files, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified based on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free from malicious or security risks. The assessments and scores across all reports are accurate and justified. No further security concerns or actions are warranted.",
