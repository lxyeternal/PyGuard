{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point or initializer for a file metadata analysis tool called MetaScout, importing core models, processing functions, and CLI commands.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs within this code snippet itself; it only imports modules and defines exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network connections, file writes, or other side-effect functions in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted input handling are present in this fragment; it primarily sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. It appears to be a standard package initializer.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from local modules, sets the version, and defines the public API via __all__. It does not perform any data processing, user input handling, or side effects. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this minimal snippet. It looks like a typical Python package __init__.py file meant for module setup and export.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup file with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares the package for use, exporting core functions and models. No suspicious or malicious code is detected.",
