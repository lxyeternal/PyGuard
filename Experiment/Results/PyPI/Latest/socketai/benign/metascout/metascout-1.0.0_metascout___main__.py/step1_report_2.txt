{
  "purpose": "The script serves as an entry point for executing the 'metascout' module directly from the command line.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'main' function from the local 'cli' module.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'main()', which may invoke further functionality; however, the code itself does not directly process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The script flows from executing as a script, importing 'main', and then calling 'main()' which could lead to further actions within the 'cli' module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple entry point script that imports and executes a main function from a local module. There are no hardcoded credentials, external network connections, or suspicious code patterns. Since the core functionality resides in 'cli.main', any malicious activity would depend on that module, which is not provided here. Based solely on this script, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point for a Python module and shows no signs of malicious behavior. It simply delegates execution to 'cli.main'. Without additional context or the content of 'cli', there are no security concerns detected in this snippet.",
