{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point to run the metascout module directly via command line.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'main' function from the local 'cli' module.",
  "sinks": "The code executes 'main()', which is a function from the 'cli' module; potential untrusted data flows depend on the implementation of 'main()'.",
  "flows": "Data flow from importing 'main' to executing 'main()' when run as __main__.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python CLI entry point. It imports a main function from a local module and executes it if the script is run directly. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or external network calls. The security of this code heavily depends on the implementation of 'main()' in 'cli', which is not provided. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard entry point for a Python module and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks on its own. It functions as a simple launcher with minimal risk, contingent on the safety of the 'cli.main' implementation.",
