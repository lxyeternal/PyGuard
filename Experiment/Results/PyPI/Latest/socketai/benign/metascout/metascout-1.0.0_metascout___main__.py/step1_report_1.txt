  "purpose": "The script serves as an entry point for executing the 'metascout' module directly from the command line.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'main' from a local module '.cli'.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'main()', which could potentially execute code with untrusted input depending on its implementation, but the current script itself does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "When run, '__main__' executes 'main()', which may process command-line arguments or input; however, no direct data flow or processing is visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code are present. The script is minimal and standard for Python CLI modules.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical entry point that imports and executes a 'main' function from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. It does not handle untrusted data directly nor perform any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign entry point for a Python module with no malicious intent or security risks evident in this snippet.",
