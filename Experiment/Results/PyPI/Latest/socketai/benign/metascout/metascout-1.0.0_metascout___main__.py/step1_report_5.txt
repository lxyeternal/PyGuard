{
  "purpose": "This script serves as an entry point for executing the metascout module directly from the command line.",
  "sources": "Imports 'main' from the local '.cli' module; reads the '__name__' variable to determine script execution.",
  "sinks": "Calls the 'main' function, which may execute additional code, but this script itself does not perform any data sinks.",
  "flows": "If executed as the main program, it runs 'main()', potentially initiating further flows within the 'cli' module.",
  "anomalies": "The script is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated content.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python script that imports and executes a main function when run directly. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no data leaks, no external connections, and no signs of malware. It functions solely as an entry point for the module. The simplicity and standard structure indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical entry point with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a simple launcher for the metascout module without any suspicious or malicious features.",
