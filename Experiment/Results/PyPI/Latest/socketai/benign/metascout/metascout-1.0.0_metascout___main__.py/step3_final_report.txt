{
  "purpose": "This script serves as a minimal Python CLI entry point that imports and executes the main function from the local cli module when run directly.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports 'main' from '.cli'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this script; it delegates execution to 'cli.main'.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the script execution to the call of 'main()' in the 'cli' module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard Python entry point script. It imports 'main' from a local module and calls it when executed as '__main__'. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious operations. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'cli.main', which is not provided. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score is justified as 0, and the security risk is minimal, around 0.1, considering potential risks in 'cli.main'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python CLI entry point with no malicious or obfuscated content. The security risk is very low, contingent on the safety of 'cli.main'.",
