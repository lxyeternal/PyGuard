{
  "purpose": "Provides batch processing operations for files in a directory, including filtering and grouping, as part of the MetaScout system.",
  "sources": "Reads directory paths, file names, and file sizes; also processes options and filters supplied by the user.",
  "sinks": "Calls external process_files function with a list of file paths and options; no other data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Directory path input -> validation -> file collection -> filtering -> size filtering -> processing via process_files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code structures. Use of external process_files is typical; no unsafe dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Logging warnings and errors are standard. No network activity, no data leaks, and no suspicious operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory validation, recursive or non-recursive file collection, filtering by name patterns and size, and passes the resulting file list to a processing function. All operations use standard libraries and follow safe practices. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The only external dependency is process_files, which is presumed to be part of the legitimate system. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code features are found. The code appears to be well-structured, with no suspicious behaviors or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe implementation of batch file processing with filtering options. There are no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks within this code segment.",
