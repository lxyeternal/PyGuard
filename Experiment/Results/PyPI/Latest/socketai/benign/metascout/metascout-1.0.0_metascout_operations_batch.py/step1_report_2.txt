{
  "purpose": "Provides batch processing operations for files in a directory, including filtering and grouping.",
  "sources": "Reads directory paths, file paths from os.listdir(), glob patterns, and file size via os.path.getsize().",
  "sinks": "Calls process_files() with a list of file paths; no direct untrusted data sinks are evident in this code.",
  "flows": "Directory path input -> os.path functions for file listing and filtering -> process_files() with filtered file list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious external connections, or unusual code behavior are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory traversal, filtering by filename patterns, grouping by extension, and filtering by size. It relies on standard libraries and a local process_files() function, with no external network calls or sensitive data handling present. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malware are detected. All operations appear standard for file processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate file processing utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses common programming practices and libraries without suspicious or harmful actions.",
