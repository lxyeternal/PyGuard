  "anomalies": "None detected; standard filesystem operations, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory validation, file collection with optional recursion, filename pattern filtering, size filtering, and passes the resulting list to an external processing function. It includes proper error handling and logging. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. The external process_files() function's behavior is unknown but presumed legitimate. The code adheres to standard practices and does not contain any anomalies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured batch file processing utility with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal risk score reflects the benign nature of the code. The primary concern remains the behavior of the external process_files() function, which cannot be assessed here but does not indicate malicious intent within this code snippet.",
