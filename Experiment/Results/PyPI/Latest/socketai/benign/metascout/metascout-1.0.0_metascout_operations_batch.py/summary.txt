  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured batch file processing utility with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal risk score reflects the benign nature of the code. The primary concern remains the behavior of the external process_files() function, which cannot be assessed here but does not indicate malicious intent within this code snippet."
