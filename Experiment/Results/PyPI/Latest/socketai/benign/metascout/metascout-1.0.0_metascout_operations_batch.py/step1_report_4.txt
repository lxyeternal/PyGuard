{
  "purpose": "Provides batch processing operations for handling files in directories, including filtering and grouping, primarily used for processing media or data files.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters such as directory_path, file_filters, exclude_filters, and options; uses os and os.path functions to access filesystem data.",
  "sinks": "Uses process_files() function (imported from core.processor), which could potentially process untrusted files; no direct sinks such as network or system commands are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Directory validation -> File collection -> Filtering (by pattern, size) -> Passing filtered files to process_files()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features are present. All operations are standard filesystem handling and filtering.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory validation, file collection, filtering based on patterns and sizes, and passes the resulting list to an external processing function. No untrusted data sources or malicious code execution paths are evident. The filters rely on safe pattern matching, and no external commands or network operations are performed. The process_files function's internal behavior isn't shown, but based on this code, the logic appears benign. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are identified. The code relies on standard library functions and typical file system interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign batch processing utility for files, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
