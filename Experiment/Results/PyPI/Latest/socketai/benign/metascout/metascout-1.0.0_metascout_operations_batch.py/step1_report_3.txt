  "purpose": "Batch processing operations for managing and filtering files within directories, including filtering by pattern, size, and grouping by type.",
  "sources": "Reads input directory path from function arguments; reads filenames from os.listdir or os.walk; reads file sizes via os.path.getsize.",
  "sinks": "Uses process_files() function as a sink for the filtered list of files; logs errors and warnings.",
  "flows": "Input directory path -> file listing (os.listdir / os.walk) -> filtering (filter_files) -> optional size filtering -> process_files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious hardcoded secrets. Uses standard library functions. No suspicious external network activity or dynamic code execution. The code appears straightforward with no obfuscated or misleading constructs. The only notable aspect is reliance on an external process_files function, but no malicious activity can be inferred from its call.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory traversal, file filtering, and grouping based on filename patterns and size. It includes standard error handling and logging. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All operations are confined to filesystem interactions and standard processing routines. The functions utilize common Python modules and patterns without any suspicious or obfuscated techniques. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual behaviors that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard file processing utility with no signs of malicious or maliciously sabotaging behavior. It performs directory listing, filtering, and processing delegation securely and transparently.",
