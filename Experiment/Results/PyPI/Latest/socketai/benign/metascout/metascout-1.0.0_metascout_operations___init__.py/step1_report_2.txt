  "purpose": "Define and export high-level operation functions for the MetaScout package related to file analysis, reporting, and future features.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the .analyze module; no external input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network, file system, or untrusted data processing are present.",
  "flows": "The module imports functions but does not process or pass data; no source-to-sink flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out import statements suggest planned features, but no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets present. No obfuscated or unusual language constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, serving as an initializer or interface for the package. It imports specific functions and sets an explicit export list. No suspicious or malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package module defining exports for analysis functions. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
