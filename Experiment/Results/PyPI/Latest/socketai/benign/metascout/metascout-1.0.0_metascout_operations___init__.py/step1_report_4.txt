{
  "purpose": "The code defines an operations module for MetaScout, providing high-level functions for file analysis, report generation, and placeholders for additional features.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .analyze module; commented import lines for other modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow involving untrusted sources or sinks detected",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code for future features; no malicious or suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of importing specific functions from a local analyze module and defining an __all__ list for module exports. All code appears to be standard for a Python package's __init__.py file. No data input, output, network calls, or insecure practices are present. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior is detected. The commented-out lines suggest planned features but do not currently introduce any security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initializer with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It mainly manages exports for other functions that are not included here.",
