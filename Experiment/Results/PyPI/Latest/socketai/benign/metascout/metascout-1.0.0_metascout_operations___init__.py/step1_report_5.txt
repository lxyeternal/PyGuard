  "purpose": "Define high-level operations for the MetaScout package related to file analysis, report generation, comparison, and redaction.",
  "sources": "Imports from .analyze module for functions; commented imports for other modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious commands; no data leaks or unsafe executions.",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules, no data flow from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Commented-out code is typical for future implementation placeholders.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module exports and documentation, with no dynamic execution, input handling, or network operations. No suspicious logic or malicious behavior observed. Commented imports suggest planned features but do not introduce risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setup with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
