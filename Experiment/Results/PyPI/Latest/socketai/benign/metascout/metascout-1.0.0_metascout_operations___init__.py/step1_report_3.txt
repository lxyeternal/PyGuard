{
  "purpose": "The code defines an operations package for MetaScout, providing high-level functions for file analysis, report generation, and future modules for batch processing, comparison, and redaction.",
  "sources": "No input data reading; imports from local modules (.analyze) and module attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external sources; no handling of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code only imports functions and sets __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; commented-out imports suggest incomplete features but are not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily serves as an interface or module aggregator, importing functions related to report writing and formatting from a local analyze module. It includes commented-out placeholders for additional functionality that is yet to be implemented. There are no signs of code injection, malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or external communications. The code is straightforward, clean, and intended for modular use.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module setup for a larger analysis package. It contains no malware, suspicious activity, or security risks. It simply organizes and exports functions for file analysis tasks. No security concerns are identified.",
