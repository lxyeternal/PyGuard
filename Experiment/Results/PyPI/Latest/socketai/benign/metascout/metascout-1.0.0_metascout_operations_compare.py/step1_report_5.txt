  "purpose": "The code provides functions for comparing file metadata, generating HTML and text reports, and identifying similar files using fuzzy hashing for security analysis and file integrity verification.",
  "sources": "File paths and metadata fields within FileMetadata objects, environment for importing dependencies, and input parameters for functions.",
  "sinks": "Printing reports, writing HTML, and returning comparison data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file metadata sources into comparison functions, where fields are extracted, flattened, and compared. Hash comparisons (including fuzzy hashes) flow from file paths to hash calculation functions, then into comparison and reporting routines.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. Use of import for optional dependencies (pyssdeep) is properly guarded. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard metadata comparison, including basic properties, timestamps, hashes, and optional fuzzy hashing for similarity detection. It uses external optional dependencies safely, with error handling if dependencies are missing. The functions generate both HTML and text reports and implement file similarity detection via fuzzy hashing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors. The overall structure and logic are consistent with legitimate file analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate file comparison utility intended for security and integrity verification. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The use of optional fuzzy hashing and report generation aligns with standard practices in security analysis tools.",
