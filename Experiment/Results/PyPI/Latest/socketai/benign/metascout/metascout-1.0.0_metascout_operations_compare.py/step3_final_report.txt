{
  "purpose": "The code performs file metadata comparison, including hashes, timestamps, and optional fuzzy hashing, and generates detailed reports in HTML and text formats.",
  "sources": "Reads local file paths, file metadata, and hashes; optionally reads files for fuzzy hashing.",
  "sinks": "Generates HTML and text reports; no data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Reads file data -> computes hashes and metadata -> generates reports; no external data flows or malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for comparing file metadata, hashes, and timestamps, with optional fuzzy hashing. It handles dependencies safely, with error handling for missing modules. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The scoring aligns with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured file comparison tool with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It warrants a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1), consistent with the analysis.",
