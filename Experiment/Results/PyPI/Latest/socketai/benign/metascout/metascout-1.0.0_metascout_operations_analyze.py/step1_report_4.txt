{
  "purpose": "The code generates and formats analysis reports for file metadata and findings, supporting multiple formats (text, JSON, CSV, HTML).",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'results' parameter, a list of FileMetadata objects, which are assumed to be supplied externally; no external untrusted sources are read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Output is written to files or stdout; no network operations, database interactions, or system commands are present. File writing occurs only to specified output files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input FileMetadata objects through formatting functions, culminating in writing report outputs. There are no untrusted data flows to external systems or commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to perform standard report generation without any hidden or malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to generate reports in various formats (text, HTML, JSON, CSV) from provided FileMetadata objects. It uses standard libraries (json, os, datetime) and a third-party library (colorama) for colored console output. The report functions simply format and output data without any external system calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The overall structure and content are consistent with typical reporting utilities and do not contain malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign report generation utility with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It only processes and outputs provided data without engaging in any harmful activities or external communications.",
