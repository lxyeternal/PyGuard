{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate and output analysis reports on file metadata, including findings, in various formats (text, JSON, CSV, HTML).",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from parameters passed to functions, notably the 'results' list of FileMetadata objects, and file paths for writing reports.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output reports to files or stdout; no untrusted data is used to influence system commands or perform actions beyond writing files.",
  "flows": "The main flow is data from 'results' being formatted into different report formats and then written to files or stdout; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks like network or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code is present. The code mainly handles report generation and formatting, with no malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard report generation module for file metadata analysis. It processes provided data objects and outputs formatted reports in multiple formats. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The functions only perform data formatting and file writing. No use of untrusted input for system commands, environment variables, or network connections is evident. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or potential malware indicators. The code's structure and content are consistent with typical report generation code, with no anomalies or malicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign report formatting and output module with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It securely processes input data for reporting purposes only.",
