{
  "purpose": "The code generates various reports (text, JSON, CSV, HTML) based on file metadata and analysis findings.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'results' parameter, which are FileMetadata objects; no external inputs are explicitly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are written to files or stdout; no network connections, database access, or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'results' parameter through formatting functions to output destinations (files or stdout); no untrusted external data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No suspicious code behavior, obfuscation, or hidden logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward report generator that processes provided file metadata and findings, formats the data into multiple output formats, and writes to files or stdout. It utilizes standard libraries and follows typical patterns for report generation. There are no indications of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The absence of external network activity, secret handling, or dynamic code execution supports this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a benign report generation utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It strictly handles data formatting and output without external interactions or suspicious behavior.",
