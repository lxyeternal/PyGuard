{
  "purpose": "This code generates reports from FileMetadata objects in various formats (text, json, csv, html), focusing on formatting and output without external data sources or system calls.",
  "sources": "Reads data from FileMetadata objects and their findings; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "Writes formatted reports to files or stdout; no external network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Processes FileMetadata objects -> formats data -> outputs to file or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward report generator that formats and outputs file metadata and findings. It uses standard libraries and no external system calls. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's behavior is consistent across all versions, with no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk stems from file writing based on input paths, which is typical for such utilities. No anomalies or suspicious signals are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured report generator with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0–0.2) are accurate and justified based on the code's functionality.",
