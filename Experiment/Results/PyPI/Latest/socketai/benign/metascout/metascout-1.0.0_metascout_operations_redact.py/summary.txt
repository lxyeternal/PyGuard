  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured metadata redaction utility with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation. It uses standard libraries, handles errors gracefully, and includes fallback mechanisms that do not pose security risks. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified based on its functionality and implementation."
