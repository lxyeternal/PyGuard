  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a legitimate metadata redaction utility for images, PDFs, Office docs, and audio files. No malicious behavior detected. Uses common libraries. No network activity or backdoors.\n\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment**: The reasoning is sound. The code employs standard libraries, handles errors gracefully, and performs expected operations. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the use of well-known libraries, controlled file operations, and no network activity. Notes dynamic imports but considers them standard for optional dependencies.\n\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment**: The analysis is consistent. Slightly higher risk score than Report 1 possibly due to dynamic imports, but overall low risk. No malicious intent evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Focuses on the purpose, sources, sinks, and flow. Highlights that the code only operates on local files, with no network activity or suspicious behavior. Mentions that dependencies are standard and no secrets or backdoors are present.\n\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment**: The reasoning aligns well. The code is a privacy-focused utility with no malicious signs. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the use of known libraries, local file operations, and no malicious activity. Notes dynamic imports but considers them typical.\n\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment**: Consistent and reasonable. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Reinforces that the code only processes files locally, uses standard libraries, and has no network activity or malicious behavior. Notes fallback mechanisms and dynamic imports but finds no signs of sabotage.\n\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n- **Assessment**: The analysis is thorough. The risk score of zero is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity and use of standard libraries.\n\n- **Risk Score**: The scores range from 0 to 0.2, reflecting low security risk. Given the code's purpose, handling of files, and lack of malicious activity, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code performs standard file operations for metadata removal, using well-known open-source libraries.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present.\n- Dynamic imports are typical for optional dependencies and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- Error handling and fallback mechanisms are appropriate and do not introduce security concerns.\n- The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.1 (slightly above zero due to dynamic imports, but still very low)\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a legitimate, low-risk metadata redaction utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
