  "purpose": "Define data models for metadata and findings related to files in the MetaScout project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for dataclasses, typing, and field defaults; class attribute definitions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; purely data modeling",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic code or execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of dataclasses for data structure definition",
  "analysis": "The code defines two dataclasses, MetadataFinding and FileMetadata, which are used to store metadata and analysis results. There are no functions performing I/O, data processing, or external calls. The fields are standard data containers with default factories to handle mutable defaults. No hardcoded secrets, no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for data modeling and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for such purposes.",
