{
  "purpose": "Define data models for metadata analysis and findings within MetaScout.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, field, asdict, and typing modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present; data models are for internal use.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely structural definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes, MetadataFinding and FileMetadata, with fields for storing metadata information and findings. It uses standard Python dataclasses and type annotations, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data manipulation. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a straightforward schema for metadata representation in MetaScout. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, focusing solely on data structure definitions.",
