  "purpose": "Define data models for storing metadata and findings related to file analysis in MetaScout.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses and typing modules; class attributes initializing data structures.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; mainly data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up structured data models using Python's dataclasses for managing file metadata and analysis findings. It uses standard library features and straightforward data structures. There are no external input sources, no unsafe operations, and no hidden or malicious code. The 'to_dict' method facilitates serialization but does not perform any harmful actions. Overall, the code appears to serve a structural purpose with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of data models for metadata and findings in a security analysis context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code fragment.",
