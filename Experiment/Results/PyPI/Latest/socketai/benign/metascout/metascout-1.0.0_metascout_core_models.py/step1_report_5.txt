  "purpose": "Define data models for storing metadata and findings related to files in MetaScout.",
  "sources": "Import statements for dataclasses and typing modules, class attribute definitions, default factory functions, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code does not process external data or perform I/O operations beyond data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; code only defines data structures without processing or input/output logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions for modeling file metadata and findings. It imports standard modules, defines classes with attributes, and includes docstrings explaining purpose. There are no functions executing logic, no data processing, or external communication. The usage of dataclasses and type hints adheres to common Python practices. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining data models without any operational logic. It appears to serve as part of a larger system for file metadata analysis in MetaScout. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this code snippet.",
