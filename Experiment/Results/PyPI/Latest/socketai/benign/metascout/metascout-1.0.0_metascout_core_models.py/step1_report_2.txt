  "purpose": "Define core data models for metadata and findings analysis in MetaScout.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static data model definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output operations present.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard dataclasses without dynamic code execution or obfuscation; no secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for modeling metadata findings and file metadata, including fields for storing various attributes and results. There are no external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The implementation is straightforward and adheres to typical Python dataclass usage without signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, defining data structures for metadata analysis. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks.",
