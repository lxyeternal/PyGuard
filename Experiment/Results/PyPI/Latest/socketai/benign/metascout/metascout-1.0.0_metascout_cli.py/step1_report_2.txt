  "purpose": "Command-line interface for MetaScout, a tool for analyzing, comparing, and redacting file metadata.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments; file paths provided for analysis, batch processing, comparison, and redaction.",
  "sinks": "File operations (reading and writing files), printing output, logging activities.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into command handlers, which process files and generate reports or perform modifications; data from files flow into processing functions and may be outputted to logs or files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features present. Use of external modules is standard for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a CLI with subcommands for analyzing files, batch processing directories, comparing file metadata, and redacting metadata. It handles user input, validates files and directories, and invokes processing functions accordingly. Logging and output handling are standard. There is no indication of malicious intent, such as network communication to unknown domains, data exfiltration, or covert backdoors. The functions call external modules like 'process_file' and 'redact_metadata', which are assumed to be safe, as their internal implementations are not provided. The code processes files securely by validating paths and handling errors appropriately. No suspicious data leaks or malicious behaviors are evident within this script. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate CLI wrapper for metadata analysis with no malicious activities or security risks observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard command-line interface for a metadata analysis tool. It handles user input securely, performs file operations responsibly, and lacks any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears safe with a very low malware score.",
