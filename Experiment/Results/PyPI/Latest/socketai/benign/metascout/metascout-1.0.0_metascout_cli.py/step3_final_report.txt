{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for the MetaScout tool, enabling analysis, batch processing, comparison, and redaction of files with various options.",
  "sources": "User input via CLI arguments, file paths, and optional configuration files (YARA rules).",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout or specified files; no network or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "CLI argument parsing → validation → delegation to processing functions → report generation/output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper that orchestrates file analysis and manipulation through external modules. It performs input validation, logging, and command dispatching without any network activity or obfuscated code. External functions like 'process_file' and 'redact_metadata' are assumed safe, as their implementations are not provided. The code does not contain malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the minimal inherent risk of this orchestrator code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are consistent with its behavior. No modifications are necessary; the supply chain and runtime security posture appear sound.",
