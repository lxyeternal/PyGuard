  "purpose": "This code implements a command-line interface for MetaScout, a tool for analyzing, comparing, redacting, and processing file metadata.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments, particularly file paths and options; configuration files for YARA rules.",
  "sinks": "File operations such as reading input files, writing reports, and redacted files; console output.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> Validation -> Processing functions -> File read/write operations -> Output reports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code detected. All external library usage appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard CLI parsing, file validation, and calls functions for processing files, comparison, and redaction. Input paths are validated for existence, and outputs are written to specified locations or stdout. External modules like 'process_file', 'write_report', 'redact_metadata', and 'compare_metadata' are imported but not shown, so their behaviors are unknown. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration observed within this snippet. The code handles files securely, with no indications of malicious behavior or intentional sabotage. Overall, the logic is straightforward and adheres to expected patterns for CLI tools, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI interface for a metadata analysis tool. There are no evident malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks present within this module. External functions imported could contain risks, but based solely on this code, it is safe. The overall security risk score is low.",
