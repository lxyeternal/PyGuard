  "purpose": "Set environment variable to hide Pygame support prompt and import the Pygame library for game or multimedia development.",
  "sources": "Access to environment variable 'PYGAME_HIDE_SUPPORT_PROMPT' via os.environ",
  "sinks": "Environment variable setting via os.environ, import of pygame module",
  "flows": "Code sets environment variable, then imports pygame",
  "anomalies": "The code simply modifies an environment variable and imports a library without additional logic. No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and sets an environment variable to suppress the Pygame support prompt, then imports pygame. No user input is read, nor is any untrusted data handled. The environment variable modification is straightforward, and the import of pygame is typical for multimedia projects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily preparing the environment for using Pygame without displaying the support prompt. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
