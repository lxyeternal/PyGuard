  "purpose": "Set an environment variable to hide Pygame support prompt and import the pygame module.",
  "sources": "Environment variable assignment `os.environ['PYGAME_HIDE_SUPPORT_PROMPT']` and module imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only sets environment variable and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Setting `'PYGAME_HIDE_SUPPORT_PROMPT'` to `'True'` as a string is slightly unconventional but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs minimal setup: setting an environment variable and importing modules. No network activity, data handling, or malicious code detected. The environment variable assignment uses a string `'True'`, which is acceptable but slightly unconventional. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup snippet for a Pygame application with no malicious or security concerns. The environment variable setting is harmless, and the module imports are standard. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate given the minimal and benign nature of the code.",
