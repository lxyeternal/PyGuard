{
  "purpose": "Import modules related to the 'blakbox' package and conditionally print a version and quote based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reading the environment variable 'BLAKBOX_NO_PROMT' from 'os.environ'; calling 'random.choice' on 'quotes.BLAKBOX_QUOTES'.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statement outputs version info and a quote, which could potentially leak information if the environment is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check (source) -> conditional print statement (sink) using data from 'os.environ' and 'quotes.BLAKBOX_QUOTES'.",
  "anomalies": "The environment variable 'BLAKBOX_NO_PROMT' is used to control output, which is standard; however, the use of 'random.choice' for quote selection is benign. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules from the 'blakbox' package and one from 'blakbox.globs'. It then checks if a specific environment variable ('BLAKBOX_NO_PROMT') is set. If not, it prints version information concatenated with a randomly chosen quote from a predefined list. There are no suspicious data flows, no hardcoded secrets, no external network activity, or unusual code constructs. The print statement is straightforward and uses standard Python functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform standard initialization and informational output without any malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on environment variables for control, which is typical for configuration purposes.",
