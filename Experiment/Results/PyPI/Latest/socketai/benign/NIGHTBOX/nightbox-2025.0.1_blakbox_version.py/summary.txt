  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static declaration of version constants with no malicious or security issues. The assessments are accurate; the only adjustment is to set the risk score to 0, removing the minor anomaly score of 0.1. The code poses no threat, and the scores should reflect zero malware, zero obfuscation, and zero security risk."
