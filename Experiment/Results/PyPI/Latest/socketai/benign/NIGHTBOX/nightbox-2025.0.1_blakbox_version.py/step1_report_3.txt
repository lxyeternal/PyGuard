  "purpose": "Define versioning constants for the BLAKBOX application or library.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows occur as the code only assigns integer values to constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual code constructs or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares three integer constants representing version components (year, minor, patch) for a project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It does not handle external data, user input, or sensitive information. The structure is clean and standard for versioning info.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
