  "purpose": "Definition of versioning constants for a software component or package",
  "sources": "Hardcoded integers assigned to version-related variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded version numbers, including a future year (2025), but no suspicious behavior or anomalies",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns static integer values to three variables representing version information. No external input is read, no data leakage, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling is evident. The presence of a future year (2025) as a version component is unusual but not malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward versioning constants without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard practice to define version information this way.",
