  "purpose": "Define version information constants for BLAKBOX with static integer values.",
  "sources": "No external input; static variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; simple static assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a future year (2025) as a version component, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, declaring three integer constants for versioning. No dynamic behavior, external inputs, or suspicious constructs are present. The only minor anomaly is the future year 2025, which does not pose a security risk. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low risk scores. The confidence in these assessments is high. The use of a future year is not a security concern but could be flagged as an unusual versioning choice. Overall, the code is benign, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static declaration of version constants with no malicious or security issues. The assessments are accurate; the only adjustment is to set the risk score to 0, removing the minor anomaly score of 0.1. The code poses no threat, and the scores should reflect zero malware, zero obfuscation, and zero security risk.",
