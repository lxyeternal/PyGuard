  "purpose": "Define versioning constants for a project or package.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; simple variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of all caps with underscores suggests constants, no anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares three integer constants representing version components. There is no data input, no processing, and no use of external or untrusted data. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident from these variable declarations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of version number constants with no malicious intent or security risks.",
