{
  "purpose": "The code defines three integer constants representing version information, likely for a software package or module.",
  "sources": "These constants are assigned hardcoded integer values within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code segment; no untrusted data handling or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; the code only assigns static values to constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns static integer values to three variables representing a version number. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The constants seem to denote a release year and version increments. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward declaration of version constants with no malicious or security-related issues.",
