  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple, static variable assignments defining version constants.\n- No external input, data processing, or dynamic behavior is involved.\n- The presence of a future year (2025) in the versioning is noted as unusual but not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity are identified in any report.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n**Code correctness:**  \n- The code snippets in all reports match the original code: static integer assignments for versioning constants.  \n- No issues or discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Malicious activity or vulnerabilities:**  \n- The reports consistently conclude no malicious intent, which aligns with the code's simplicity.  \n- No signs of backdoors, malicious payloads, or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Potential flaws or reasoning errors:**  \n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.  \n- The use of a future year (2025) as a version component is unusual but not suspicious or harmful.\n\n---\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's straightforward nature.\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- All reports assign 0, which is correct; no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Security risk score:**  \n- All reports assign very low (mostly 0) risk scores, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n**Confidence levels:**  \n- High confidence (mostly 1.0) is appropriate, as the analysis aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations and justifications:\n\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.  \n- No changes are necessary unless new information emerges.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (as per report 1) or 0 (others). Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Justification:**  \n- The code is straightforward, with no external data or suspicious constructs.  \n- The only \"anomaly\" is the future year (2025), which is not malicious but perhaps slightly unusual for versioning. Still, it does not pose any security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                       | No malicious activity detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                       | No obfuscation present.                                       |\n| Security Risk    | 0                       | No vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.                   |\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.",
