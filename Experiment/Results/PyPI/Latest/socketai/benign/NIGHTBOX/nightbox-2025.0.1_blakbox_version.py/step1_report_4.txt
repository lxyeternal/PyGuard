  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static variable assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Variables are hardcoded with fixed version numbers; no anomalies in the context of version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns fixed integer values to variables representing version components. There are no input/output operations, no external data handling, and no suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward, defining constants for versioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, defining version constants without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
