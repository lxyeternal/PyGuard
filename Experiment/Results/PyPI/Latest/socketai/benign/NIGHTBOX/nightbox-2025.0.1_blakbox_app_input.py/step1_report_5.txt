{
  "purpose": "Define key mappings and mouse button constants for input handling in a game or application.",
  "sources": "Importing from 'blakbox.globs' and 'blakbox.app.resource.image'; defining class attributes for keys and mouse buttons.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily sets constants and simple class structures for input mapping.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only establishes static mappings and simple methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for keyboard and mouse inputs, using static mappings from a 'pg' module, likely 'pygame'. It also defines classes with attributes and methods related to input handling, with no processing of untrusted data or network communication. The import statements are straightforward; 'blakbox' appears to be a package or module namespace, with no signs of malicious intent. There are no backdoors, hidden code, or malicious functions present. The code's structure is clear and conventional, serving as a configuration or constants module for input controls.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for input mapping and control constants without any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a setup module for key and mouse input handling, with no signs of malware or security concerns.",
