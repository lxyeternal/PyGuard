{
  "purpose": "Defines keyboard key mappings and mouse button constants for input handling in a game or application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'blakbox.globs' and 'blakbox.app.resource.image'. No other data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; code only defines constants and class structures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code merely sets up static mappings and class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely establishes constant mappings for keyboard keys and mouse buttons, using an external library 'pygame' (assumed via 'pg'). It imports modules but does not process or handle external data inputs. The classes define static attributes representing key codes and mouse button identifiers. There are no functions, data processing, or control flow. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The import of 'Image' appears standard for resource management, with no indication of malicious usage. Overall, this code appears purely structural, setting up input mappings without any suspicious or harmful logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup of input constants and resource class placeholders, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It poses no security risks and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
