{
  "purpose": "Defines key mappings for keyboard and mouse inputs using the 'blakbox.globs' module, likely for input handling in a game or application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'blakbox.globs' and 'blakbox.app.resource.image', which are external modules; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None detected. The code primarily assigns constants and defines classes without executing dangerous operations or processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow or data processing occurs beyond static assignments and class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is straightforward, defining key mappings and mouse controls without dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static class definitions mapping keyboard and mouse controls to constants from an imported module. It uses simple assignments and nested class structures. No external input is read, no data is transmitted, and no suspicious logic is present. The use of external dependencies appears legitimate, assuming the 'blakbox' modules are trustworthy. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard input configuration setup for a gaming or graphical application. It does not contain malicious code, hidden behaviors, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
