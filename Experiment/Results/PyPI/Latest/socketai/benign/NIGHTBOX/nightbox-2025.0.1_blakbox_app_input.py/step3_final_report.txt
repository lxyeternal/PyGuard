  "purpose": "Defines static key and mouse button mappings for input handling, likely in a game or graphical application.",
  "sources": "External modules 'blakbox.globs' and 'blakbox.app.resource.image'; constants from 'pg' (probably Pygame).",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, transmission, or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of key constants to class variables; no data flow or dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static definitions with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module mapping keys and mouse buttons to constants, with no dynamic or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. External dependencies are assumed trustworthy; the code serves as input setup. The lambda for mouse visibility is a simple wrapper around a standard function. Overall, the code is benign and standard for input configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static input mapping setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
