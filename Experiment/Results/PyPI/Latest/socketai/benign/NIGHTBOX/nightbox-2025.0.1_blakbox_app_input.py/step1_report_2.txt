{
  "purpose": "Define key mappings for keyboard and mouse inputs, including constants for keys and mouse buttons, as well as mouse position data.",
  "sources": "Constants imported from 'blakbox.globs' (specifically 'pg'), which is likely a wrapper or alias for a library like Pygame; no user input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only declares constants and class structures without processing or outputting untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or external data. The code solely sets static class variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious code behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection are present. The code is straightforward and consists only of constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static mappings for keyboard keys and mouse buttons using constants from the 'pg' module (likely Pygame). It includes key categories (letters, numbers, function keys, special keys, arrows, numpad, modifiers, symbols) and mouse button identifiers. The Mouse class includes positional data placeholders and a method to set mouse visibility. There are no functions that process external inputs, no dynamic code execution, or any network operations. The use of lambda for 'visible' is a simple wrapper for Pygame's 'set_visible' method, which is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration module defining input constants and mouse data structures. It contains no suspicious or malicious behaviors. It appears to be a benign part of a larger application, primarily used for input handling.",
