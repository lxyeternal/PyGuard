{
  "purpose": "Define constants for keyboard and mouse input handling for a game or application, mapping keys and mouse buttons to specific codes and states.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'blakbox.globs' for 'pg' (likely Pygame) and 'blakbox.app.resource.image' for 'Image'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; no functions that process untrusted data or perform output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or storage; primarily constant definitions and simple class structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or obfuscation detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of constant mappings for keyboard keys via 'pg.K_*' attributes and mouse button identifiers. The 'Mouse' class includes position state placeholders and a method to toggle visibility. All parts are static definitions without dynamic input handling or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The usage of 'pg' (likely Pygame) suggests typical input mapping, and the 'Image' class appears to be a placeholder for resource handling. The code structure is straightforward and consistent with input configuration modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a static configuration for input controls without any malicious behavior. It does not contain backdoors, hidden data leaks, or suspicious logic. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
