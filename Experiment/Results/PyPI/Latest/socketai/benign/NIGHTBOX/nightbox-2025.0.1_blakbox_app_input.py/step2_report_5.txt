  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines static classes (`Keyboard` and `Mouse`) with constants mapping to key codes and mouse button identifiers.\n   - It imports modules from `blakbox.globs` and `blakbox.app.resource.image`, which are external dependencies.\n   - The classes contain no functions that process data, no dynamic code, no input handling beyond static constants, and no network operations.\n   - The `Mouse` class includes placeholders for position data and a lambda to set mouse visibility, which wraps `pg.mouse.set_visible`.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, code obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n   - The code appears to be a configuration module for input controls, typical in game development or graphical applications.\n   - The use of external modules (`blakbox`) seems legitimate, assuming the modules are trustworthy.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, no data leaks, no code injection, and no dynamic execution.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.95), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - Since there are no malicious signs, the scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Assumptions:**\n   - The only external dependency is `blakbox`, which could be scrutinized if untrusted. However, based on the code snippet alone, there’s no evidence of malicious intent.\n   - The code is purely static and does not process external data or execute dynamic code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, static configuration module for input mappings.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk based on this code snippet)\n\n**Final note:** While external dependencies should always be verified, based solely on this code, it is safe and standard for input configuration purposes.",
