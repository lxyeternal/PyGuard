{
  "purpose": "To configure the setup and packaging of the NIGHTBOX Python project, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version dictionary, the README.md file for long description, and static metadata fields such as name, author, and URL.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No dangerous source-to-sink data flows are present; the version string is constructed from constants, and README.md is read as static content.",
  "anomalies": "The version year is set to 2025, which is a future date; no other anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. The only dynamic aspect is reading the README.md file for long_description, which is typical and not suspicious. The version year being set to 2025 could be an inconsistency but is not malicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. The only notable point is the future version year, which might be an oversight or intentional for versioning.",
