  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging the NIGHTBOX Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, accesses version dictionary for version string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and constructs version string from in-memory data; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Syntax error in version string due to nested quotes; future year (2025) in version may be a placeholder or oversight.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with a syntax mistake in the version assignment line, which would prevent execution. No malicious code, obfuscated patterns, or security vulnerabilities are present. The version's future date is unusual but not malicious. Scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code and the technical bug. The syntax error is a bug, not malicious activity, and does not impact security. The overall security posture is very low risk, with the main issue being a fix needed for correct execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with a minor syntax error. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis. Correcting the syntax will enable proper execution. The future date in the version is likely an oversight but does not pose security concerns.",
