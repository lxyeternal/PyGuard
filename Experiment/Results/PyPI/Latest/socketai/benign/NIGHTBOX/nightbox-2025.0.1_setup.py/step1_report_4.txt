{
  "purpose": "Configure the packaging and distribution of a Python project named NIGHTBOX.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a dictionary, reads the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools.setup() to define package metadata and dependencies; no apparent data sinks for untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Version string constructed from a dictionary, static project metadata fed into setuptools.setup(). No dynamic data flow from external sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "The version dictionary uses a future year (2025), which may be an oversight but is not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code features detected. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python package named NIGHTBOX using setuptools. It defines a version with a future year, reads the README.md file for the long description, and specifies dependencies and classifiers. All operations are standard for package setup. No user input, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior or data leakage observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
