  "purpose": "Configure the packaging and distribution settings for a Python project named NIGHTBOX.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a dictionary, reads README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified that directly handle untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "Uses version data to set package version; reads README.md content for long description.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated elements, or suspicious behaviors. The version is set to 2025, which is a future date but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for packaging. Defines a version dictionary with a future year (2025), then constructs the version string. Reads the README.md file for description content. Uses setuptools.setup() to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or suspicious code detected. No code injection, data leakage, or backdoors present. The code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration with an unusual version year, which could be a typo or a placeholder but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The only notable aspect is the future version year, which is likely an oversight or placeholder, not a security concern.",
