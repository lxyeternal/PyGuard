  "purpose": "Define a Scene class for managing rendering and interface elements within a graphical application.",
  "sources": "Import statements; abs_path function call for font_path; app, app.window, app.camera, app.window.mod_display",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data used in potentially dangerous operations",
  "flows": "abs_path() provides font_path; font_path used in Interface constructor; app, app.window, app.camera used for configuration and display",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; code appears standard for a graphical scene setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines a Scene class with initialization for display, interface, tilemap, and partition objects. It uses abs_path to resolve a font path, which is a benign operation assuming abs_path is a standard path resolution. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling that could lead to security issues are present. The methods are placeholders, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is embedded within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for a graphical scene with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It uses well-defined classes and functions for rendering, input handling, and configuration without any suspicious patterns.",
