{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules from the 'blakbox.app' package, likely for initializing or setting up an application framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'blakbox.app' modules, which load dependencies and internal components.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports modules without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, with no executable code, data handling, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code appears to be standard setup code for an application framework, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements for internal modules. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the analysis and can remain at zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
