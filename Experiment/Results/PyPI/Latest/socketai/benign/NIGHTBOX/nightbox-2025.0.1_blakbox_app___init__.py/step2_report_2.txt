  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code only contains import statements; no executable or data flow.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; only imports.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues found.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Only import statements.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 fit.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Only imports.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Only imports.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 fit.\n- **Justification:** No malware or malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is solely import statements with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The malware scores are all appropriately zero.\n- Obfuscated scores are zero, as no obfuscation is present.\n- Security risk scores are zero, given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n- The confidence levels are high, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard import statements)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code snippet is benign, consisting solely of import statements establishing dependencies for a larger application. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
