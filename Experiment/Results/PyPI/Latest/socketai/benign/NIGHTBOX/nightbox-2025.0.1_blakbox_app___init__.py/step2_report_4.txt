  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is just import statements from 'blakbox.app' modules.\n- No executable code, data flow, or network activity.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- Malware score: 0 — correct, no malicious behavior.\n- Risk score: 0 — appropriate, as there's no security concern.\n- Confidence: 1 — high, as the analysis is straightforward.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above, standard import statements.\n- No signs of malicious activity or anomalies.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk score: 0 — justified.\n- Confidence: 0.9 — reasonable, given the straightforward nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion, standard imports.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as previous; standard import statements.\n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same, only import statements.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is solely composed of import statements.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity.\n- The malware scores are all appropriately zero.\n- The risk scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of security issues.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code snippet is a standard set of import statements for an application framework.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, and no changes to the scores are necessary.",
