  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Content:** Import statements only, no executable code.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. All imports are from internal modules, typical for setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (reasonable given no active code, but since no actual code execution, could be lower). However, the report's risk is 0, which is acceptable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Content:** Same as above—import statements, standard modules.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies, no suspicious patterns, no data flow or external communication.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Given the lack of executable code, risk could be lowered from 0.5 to 0, but 0.5 is acceptable as a conservative default.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Content:** Import statements for a graphical application framework.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, no suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Content:** Same as above, standard import statements.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Content:** Import statements only.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- All reports are based solely on static import statements with no executable code, data handling, or network activity.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The risk scores assigned in the reports are mostly at 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- Since all snippets are just import statements, the **malware score should remain at 0**.\n- The **obfuscated score** should also be 0, as there's no evidence of obfuscation.\n- The **risk score** should be **0** for all reports, reflecting the lack of any security concern.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code snippets provided.",
