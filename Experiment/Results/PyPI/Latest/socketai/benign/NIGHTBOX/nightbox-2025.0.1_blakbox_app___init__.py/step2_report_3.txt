  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The report correctly states that these are import statements from 'blakbox.app' modules, with no executable code, data flow, or suspicious activity.\n- The confidence is high (1), and no anomalies, malware, or security risks are identified.\n- **Score adjustments:** The malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores are all 0, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, it notes that these are standard import statements with no data flow or anomalies.\n- Confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but still high.\n- No issues here; scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, a straightforward import set with no signs of malicious activity.\n- Confidence is 1, and all scores are 0.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: import statements with no suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence is 1, scores are 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also just import statements, no malicious indicators.\n- Confidence is 1, scores are 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is solely import statements.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- Since the code is purely import statements with no malicious or suspicious activity, I agree with the current scores.\n- No changes needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated code score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is benign, just setting up dependencies for a larger application.",
