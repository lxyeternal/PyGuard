  "purpose": "Static list of quotes intended for display or logging within a Python application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a hardcoded list of strings assigned to BLAKBOX_QUOTES.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the list is static and used for display purposes only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the static list to any display or logging functions; no external data flow or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static list of strings with no dynamic behavior, external inputs, or malicious payloads. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The scores are consistent with the code's static, benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, static, and poses no security risks or malicious behavior. It is a straightforward list of quotes with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
