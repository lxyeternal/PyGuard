  "purpose": "Define a list of quote strings for use within a larger application or module.",
  "sources": "The list BLAKBOX_QUOTES, which contains hardcoded string literals.",
  "sinks": "Potentially used in displaying messages or logs; no untrusted data input or output flows identified.",
  "flows": "The code simply initializes a list with static strings; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a list of predefined string literals to a variable. All strings are hardcoded and static, with no external input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. No sensitive information, credentials, or malicious payloads are present. Usage appears benign and typical for UI or messaging features.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign list of quotes intended for display or logging. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
