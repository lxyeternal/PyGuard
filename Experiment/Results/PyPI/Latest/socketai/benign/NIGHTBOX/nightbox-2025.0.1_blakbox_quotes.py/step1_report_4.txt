  "sources": "No external input sources; data is hardcoded within the code.",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks, no data flows from untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only defines a static list.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a list of string literals assigned to a variable. All elements are plain strings, with no dynamic code execution, external data reading, or malicious content. No potential security issues or malicious behaviors are apparent.",
