  "purpose": "Utility functions for mathematical calculations, vector operations, and path handling.",
  "sources": "Input paths in abs_path and rel_path functions; point and bounds in point_inside; path strings in abs_path and rel_path.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processed into sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Path strings are processed in abs_path and rel_path; point data used in point_inside and angle_to functions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import from 'blakbox.globs', which is not a standard library and could be suspicious, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for sine wave calculation, damping, vector math, and path manipulation. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is present. The import from 'blakbox.globs' is unconventional and warrants further verification but does not in itself indicate malicious intent. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and security risk is low (~0.2), justified by the unusual import but no active threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious behavior. The only concern is the import statement from 'blakbox.globs', which should be verified in the broader context. Scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
