  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing, possibly related to web scraping or network communication, but the specific purpose is not explicitly clear.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from network requests, file reads, or user input (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Data may be sent over network sockets, written to files, or printed to the console; specific sink locations are not detailed in the visible code.",
  "flows": "Potential data flow from input sources through processing functions to output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious function names. No use of obfuscated code features. Code structure appears normal. However, lacking detailed context makes some flows ambiguous.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure includes functions that process data, possibly involving network or file I/O. There are no signs of malicious code such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated elements are present. The code could be part of a legitimate data handling module. Due to lack of explicit input/output handling details, some uncertainties remain about the nature of data sources and sinks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no clear indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and consistent with typical data processing tasks. The overall security risk is low.",
