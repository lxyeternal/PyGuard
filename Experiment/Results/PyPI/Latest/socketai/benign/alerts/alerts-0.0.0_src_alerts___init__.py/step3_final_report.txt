  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variable reads, file/network I/O, data processing functions, placeholders or empty scripts.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables or network connections, data processing outputs, placeholder code with no sinks.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, files, network) to processing functions with no evidence of malicious data exfiltration or control flow hijacking.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads; placeholder or empty scripts noted.",
  "analysis": "All reports describe benign code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. Malware scores are consistently 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited code snippets. No anomalies or indicators of malicious activity are present. The reasoning aligns with the scores, and assessments are cautious yet justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the descriptions. No adjustments are necessary.",
