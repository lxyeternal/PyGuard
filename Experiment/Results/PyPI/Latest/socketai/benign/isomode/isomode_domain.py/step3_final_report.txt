{
  "purpose": "Generate domains and domain walls from phonon modes for structural analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data includes primitive cell, supercell matrix, and phonon mode parameters; data is read from class attributes and method arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; visualization via vesta_view is local and benign.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through class methods to generate distorted structures and visualizations; no external network or data leaks involved.",
  "anomalies": "Incomplete method implementations (`add_mode` in `DomainBuilderPhonon`, `save_supercell`), and logical bug in `get_distortions()` where `distortion` is overwritten each loop iteration instead of accumulated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a scientific utility for manipulating crystal structures based on phonon modes. It contains incomplete methods and a logical flaw but no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The unimplemented methods are placeholders, and the logical bug in `get_distortions()` is a typical implementation error. There are no signs of external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to incomplete features, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign scientific utility with no malicious behavior. The logical flaws and incomplete methods are typical development issues, not security concerns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.2, reflecting minor implementation gaps but no active threats.",
