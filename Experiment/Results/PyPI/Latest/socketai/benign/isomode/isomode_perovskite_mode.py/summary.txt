  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate scientific analysis tool for vibrational modes with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1) in some reports is justified by debugging print statements but does not indicate any threat. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and purpose-specific."
