  "purpose": "This code defines functions and data structures for analyzing vibrational modes in a perovskite structure, including constructing mode basis vectors and labeling vibrational eigenmodes based on eigenvectors or displacements.",
  "sources": "Reads input via function parameters such as phdisp, masses, and evec; uses atomic data from 'ase.data'.",
  "sinks": "Performs numpy operations on input eigenvectors for mode classification; no data leaks or external network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Eigenvector inputs are normalized and compared with predefined mode vectors for classification; no data flow to external sources or sinks beyond internal computations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of numpy and 'ase' library is standard for scientific computations. No obfuscated code, no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly deals with defining vibrational mode vectors and classifying eigenmodes based on similarity measures. It utilizes standard scientific libraries (numpy, ase). All data flows are within mathematical processing of input eigenvectors and atomic data. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious modifications are present. The code structure is straightforward, with functions for generating basis vectors and labeling modes, typical of computational physics code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate scientific analysis tool for vibrational modes in materials. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious data handling are detected.",
