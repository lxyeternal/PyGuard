{
  "purpose": "The code defines vibrational modes, symmetry labels, and basis transformations for phonon analysis in crystalline materials, primarily for mode classification and eigenvector matching.",
  "sources": "Eigenvector inputs, eigen-displacements, and atomic data from 'ase.data' and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks or network activity; data flows are confined within in-memory numpy computations.",
  "flows": "Eigenvector data from input or generated internally flows through normalization, dot products, and basis matching functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no malicious code, no suspicious system commands or external data handling. Print statements are for debugging or informational purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard scientific computations for vibrational mode classification, using numpy for vector operations and 'ase.data' for atomic properties. No external data streams, network calls, or system modifications are present. The functions normalize eigenvectors, compare them to basis vectors, and assign labels based on similarity thresholds. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The print statements are benign and typical for debugging. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate scientific analysis tool for vibrational modes with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1) in some reports is justified by debugging print statements but does not indicate any threat. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and purpose-specific.",
