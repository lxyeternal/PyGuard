{
  "purpose": "This script generates phonon distortions and structures based on input data, analyzes mode details, and outputs CIF and pickle files for further study.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters from function arguments, imports external libraries, and reads mode details from 'mode_detail.txt' via the Isomode parser.",
  "sinks": "Writes output files: CIF files, pickle files, mode detail text, and distorted structure files. No untrusted data sink is present.",
  "flows": "Uses input parameters to generate distorted structures, then reads 'mode_detail.txt' to prepare structures; no user input is directly processed at runtime beyond argument defaults.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or obfuscated segments detected. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or malicious code present. The commented-out section does not perform any suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports established scientific libraries and custom modules related to phonon distortions. It defines a function 'run_all' that generates structures and analyzes modes, saving results to specified files. All operations are consistent with typical scientific workflows, with no indication of malicious intent. The commented-out code does not contain malicious code; it merely calls 'isodistort' which is a local function. There are no dynamic code execution, network communications, or secret handling present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate scientific tool for phonon distortion analysis. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected, and it follows expected patterns for such applications.",
