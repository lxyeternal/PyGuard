{
  "purpose": "The code performs phonon mode analysis, structure generation, distortion visualization, and file output for materials science research.",
  "sources": "Reads input files such as './run.abo_PHBST.nc', 'mode_detail.txt', and writes to directories and files like 'primitive.cif', 'all_modes.pickle', and 'mode_detail.txt'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network activity; data flows from input files to generated structure files and analysis outputs.",
  "flows": "Input files are read at the start; data flows through structure generation, phonon distortion, visualization, and finally to output files like CIFs, pickle, and text summaries.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected; commented-out code is benign and standard for optional analysis.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward scientific workflow involving file I/O, structure manipulation, and visualization. It relies on trusted scientific libraries and custom modules. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious routines are present. The code's purpose aligns with typical materials science analysis, and no security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-driven scientific script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
