{
  "purpose": "Processes chemical symbols, converts between symbolic and numbered formats, and reads atomic data from files or objects using the 'ase' library.",
  "sources": "Input symbols parameter, 'filename' parameter, and 'atoms' object; reads data via 'read' from 'ase.io'.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks; no data leaks, network activity, or file writes beyond reading data.",
  "flows": "Symbol input flows into 'symbol_number' and 'symnum_to_sym' functions; data read from files or 'atoms' object flows into 'get_symdict', which calls 'symbol_number'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data parsing and transformation related to chemical symbols. It uses standard libraries and exception handling appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The regex operations are simple and safe. The functions do not execute untrusted code or handle untrusted data in a dangerous way. The overall structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. External library use is typical for scientific workflows and does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard scientific data processing related to chemical symbols. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
