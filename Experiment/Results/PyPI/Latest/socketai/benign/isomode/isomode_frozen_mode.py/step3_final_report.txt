  "purpose": "The code manipulates atomic structures, generates supercells, applies distortions, trims cells, and outputs structural data for materials science simulations.",
  "sources": "External libraries (ase, spglib, isomode modules), internal data structures, and print statements.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for structural data; no network or file I/O beyond output.",
  "flows": "Data flows within class methods, involving structure manipulation and mathematical transformations, with no untrusted external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard scientific computations related to atomic structures, including supercell creation, distortion application, and cell trimming. It uses well-known scientific libraries and contains no network activity, system commands, or malicious payloads. The code is clear, well-structured, and serves a legitimate purpose in materials modeling. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscation as 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent with the absence of external communication or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific utility for manipulating atomic structures with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
