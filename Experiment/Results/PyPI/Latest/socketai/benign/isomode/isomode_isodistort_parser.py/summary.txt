  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific analysis tool with no malicious activity detected. The main security concern is the unsafe use of eval() on input data, which could be exploited if input files are maliciously crafted. It is recommended to replace eval() with safer parsing methods like 'ast.literal_eval' to mitigate this risk. Overall, the code is safe for use in trusted environments, with a minor security concern due to input parsing methods."
