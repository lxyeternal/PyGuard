{
  "purpose": "This script analyzes phonon modes from ABINIT PHBST calculations, performs symmetry analysis with ISODISTORT, and labels phonon modes with their symmetry labels and frequencies.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a PHBST.nc file via abiopen; reads command-line arguments; accesses temporary directories; reads and writes CIF files; reads mode definitions from ISODISTORT output.",
  "sinks": "Writes results to an output file with mode labels, frequencies, and symmetries.",
  "flows": "Input file is read to extract phonon data -> CIF files are written -> ISODISTORT is run to obtain symmetry mode details -> phonon displacements are projected onto symmetry modes -> final labels and frequencies are saved to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code features. No network connections or system commands beyond standard file I/O and subprocess calls. The use of third-party libraries appears typical for this domain. The temporary directory creation is standard. No indications of malicious data leakage or system damage.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a legitimate analysis tool for phonon mode labeling, using well-known scientific Python libraries and standard input/output procedures. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious system commands, or unauthorized network activity. Functions are geared towards scientific computation and file manipulation. No embedded malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are observed. The script processes input data, runs external symmetry analysis tools, and outputs structured results, all consistent with its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific analysis script with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs expected operations within its domain of phonon mode analysis and symmetry labeling. No malware or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
