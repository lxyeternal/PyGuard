{
  "purpose": "This code analyzes phonon modes from ABINIT PHBST calculations, performs symmetry analysis with ISODISTORT, projects phonon displacements onto symmetry modes, and outputs mode labels and frequencies.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a PHBST.nc file via abiopen; reads qpoints, displacements, frequencies, and structure data; uses environment variables for temporary directories.",
  "sinks": "Writes CIF files, mode details, and results to specified output files; does not write or transmit data over network or external channels.",
  "flows": "Source: Reading and parsing data from PHBST.nc file; processing phonon mode data and symmetry analysis; projecting modes; writing results to file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses tempfile.mkdtemp() for temporary directory creation; no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure is standard for scientific analysis, with no unusual or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script performs structured data processing: reading phonon and structure data, generating CIF files, executing symmetry analysis with external tools, and projecting modes onto symmetry labels. No code performs network communication, data exfiltration, or suspicious system modifications. No backdoors or hidden behaviors are evident. The use of environment variables and temp directories is standard. The code employs standard scientific Python libraries and external tools without any obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It strictly facilitates phonon mode analysis and labeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific tool for phonon mode analysis and symmetry labeling. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malicious payload, or suspicious activity. It uses standard practices for data handling and file management.",
