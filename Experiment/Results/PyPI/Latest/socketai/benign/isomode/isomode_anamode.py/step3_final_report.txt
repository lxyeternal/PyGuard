  "purpose": "The code analyzes phonon modes from ABINIT PHBST calculations, performs symmetry analysis with ISODISTORT, projects phonon modes onto symmetry labels, and outputs the labeled modes with frequencies and irreducible representations.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the PHBST.nc file via abiopen, extracts structure, q-points, displacements, and frequencies; generates CIF files; runs ISODISTORT; projects modes onto symmetry modes.",
  "sinks": "Writes CIF files, mode labels, and results to output files; no network activity or data exfiltration detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reading (abiopen) to CIF generation, symmetry analysis (isocif, isodistort), mode projection, and finally writing results; no suspicious external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; temporary directories are used in a standard manner; no hidden or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard scientific phonon analysis: reading phonon data, generating CIF files, running symmetry analysis, projecting modes, and outputting labels. External dependencies are domain-specific and open-source. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is well-structured, with clear functions and standard practices. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific tool for phonon mode analysis with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It uses standard libraries and external tools appropriately. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
