  "purpose": "The code analyzes phonon modes from ABINIT PHBST calculations using ISODISTORT, performs symmetry analysis, and labels modes accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a PHBST.nc file via abiopen; reads structure data; reads q-points and displacements; potentially writes CIF files; executes ISODISTORT analysis; reads mode definitions from a file; processes and projects phonon modes; writes results to an output file.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or untrusted data outputs; no network communications, file exfiltration, or system commands executed that could leak data or harm the system.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input file reading (abiopen) through structure and phonon data parsing, into CIF file creation, ISODISTORT analysis, mode projection, and final results output; no external or untrusted data is sent externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious variable names; no unusual or malicious code behaviors detected; temporary directory creation is standard; no suspicious network activity or system commands; commented-out code appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The script performs structured data processing for phonon analysis: reading structure and phonon data, generating CIF files, executing symmetry analysis via ISODISTORT, projecting modes onto symmetry labels, and outputting results. It uses standard scientific Python libraries and external tools in a typical manner. The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious functions, no hidden backdoors, no data exfiltration routines, and no external network activity. The only potential concern is the creation of temporary directories, which is standard for processing. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate scientific analysis tool without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate phonon analysis utility using standard scientific libraries and external tools. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its primary function is scientific data processing with no suspicious operations detected.",
