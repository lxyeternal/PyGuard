{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to analyze structural distortions and symmetry in crystallographic files, upload files to a web service for symmetry and distortion analysis, and process results locally.",
  "sources": "Reads input files (CIF, POSCAR) from disk, and fetches data from remote web services via HTTP POST requests.",
  "sinks": "Uploads CIF files to remote servers; writes output data and analysis results to local files; prints information to standard output.",
  "flows": "Input files are read and uploaded to external servers via HTTP POST; responses are parsed and processed locally; results are saved or printed. Data flows from disk to server and back to local files.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs multiple HTTP POST requests to external servers without validation of the server's safety or legitimacy. It writes responses and analysis results to local files and prints status info. No obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The use of regular expressions to extract filenames from server responses could be exploited if server responses are maliciously crafted.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a well-structured utility for crystallography analysis, involving file conversions, symmetry detection, and distortion analysis through external web services. It handles network operations, file I/O, and parsing of HTML responses. All network interactions are with specific URLs for the 'stokes.byu.edu' domain, with no evidence of data exfiltration or malicious commands. There are no indications of code injection, credential theft, or system harm. The functions utilize standard libraries and common web interaction patterns. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present. While the code interacts with remote services, it does so in a manner consistent with its scientific purpose. There are no backdoors, hidden commands, or suspicious data exfiltration mechanisms identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate scientific utility for crystallography structure analysis. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indicators. Its network communications are targeted and domain-specific, with no signs of data theft, backdoors, or harmful actions. The overall security risk is low, assuming the external services are legitimate and the local environment is secure.",
