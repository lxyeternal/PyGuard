{
  "purpose": "The code performs scientific analysis of crystal structure distortions by converting structure files to CIF format, uploading them to external web services for symmetry and distortion analysis, parsing the HTML responses to extract data, and saving the results locally. It facilitates symmetry determination and mode analysis for crystallography research.",
  "sources": "File input (structure files like CIF, POSCAR), network requests to 'stokes.byu.edu' web services for uploading CIFs, symmetry finding, and analysis.",
  "sinks": "File writes for CIFs and analysis results, network responses from web services, console output for status messages.",
  "flows": "Local files are read and converted; CIF files are uploaded via HTTP POST; HTML responses are parsed with BeautifulSoup; extracted data is used for further analysis and saved locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. External URLs are legitimate academic domains. The code relies on standard libraries and web services for scientific purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward scientific tool for analyzing crystal structures, involving file conversions, web-based symmetry and distortion analysis, and data parsing. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Network interactions are with reputable academic URLs, and exception handling is properly implemented. The data flow is typical for scientific workflows, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The reliance on external web services introduces external dependency risk but is standard for this domain.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The network activity is appropriate for its purpose, and no indicators of sabotage or malware are present.",
