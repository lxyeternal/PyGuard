  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable, serving as package metadata.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a simple string assignment with no input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a direct assignment of a version string to a variable, with no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's purpose appears to be metadata declaration. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no indications of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a version identifier with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's minimal and harmless nature.",
