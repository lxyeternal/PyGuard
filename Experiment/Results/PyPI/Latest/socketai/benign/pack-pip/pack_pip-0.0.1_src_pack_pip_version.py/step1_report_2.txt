{
  "purpose": "The code specifies the version of a package or module, likely for version control or distribution purposes.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present as the code only assigns a version string.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a version string assignment with no additional logic or context; this minimal content does not exhibit anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single assignment of a version string to a variable named 'version'. There are no input sources, no data processing, no sinks, and no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. Given its simplicity, it is likely part of a larger package but by itself does not pose any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
