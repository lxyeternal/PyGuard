  "purpose": "The provided code only specifies a version string, likely part of a larger module or package metadata.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths exist in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a version string declaration with no functional code, suspiciously minimal for a module.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is extremely minimal, consisting solely of a version declaration. It does not include any functions, data processing, input/output, or other behaviors. Due to its simplicity, there are no security issues, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation evident. The only notable aspect is that it appears to be incomplete or a fragment of a larger package metadata file.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this isolated code fragment, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The snippet likely serves as part of package metadata. No suspicious activity detected.",
