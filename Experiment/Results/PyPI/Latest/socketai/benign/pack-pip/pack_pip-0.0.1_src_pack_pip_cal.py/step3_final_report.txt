  "purpose": "Simple addition function performing arithmetic operation",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' passed to the function",
  "sinks": "Return statement output; no external data or untrusted sources involved",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow directly to the addition operation and return",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic addition function with no external dependencies, malicious payloads, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The function performs a simple arithmetic operation without side effects or external interactions. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a high confidence in its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward addition function with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports are consistent and accurate, and the scores reflect the safe nature of the code. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
