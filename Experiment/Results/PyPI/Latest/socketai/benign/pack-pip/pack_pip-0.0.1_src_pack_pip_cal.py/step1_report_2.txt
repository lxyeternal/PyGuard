  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward addition function with no external input handling beyond parameters. It performs basic arithmetic without involving external systems, data storage, or network operations. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns are present. The code is minimal, simple, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility function with no malicious intent or security risks.",
