{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions or variables from two modules, 'cal' and 'version'.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external modules 'cal' and 'version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow targets are present; only imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports; only straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements, bringing in 'add' from 'cal' and 'version' from 'version'. There are no functions, data processing, or other logic present. Import statements alone do not indicate malicious intent or malicious behavior. Since these modules are presumably part of the package or external dependencies, there are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or malicious behavior based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This minimal code snippet appears benign, serving only to import functions or variables. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident. The code does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
