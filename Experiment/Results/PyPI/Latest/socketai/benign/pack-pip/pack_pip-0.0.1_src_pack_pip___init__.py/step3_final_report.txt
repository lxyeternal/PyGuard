{
  "purpose": "Import 'add' from 'cal' and 'version' from 'version' modules, likely for use in subsequent code.",
  "sources": "Modules 'cal' and 'version' imported at the top level.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements with no further logic. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leakage. The modules 'cal' and 'version' are common names; unless these modules are malicious or compromised, the code appears benign. The import statements are standard practice and do not pose security risks in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The minimal import statements do not constitute a security threat. The scores should reflect this benign nature.",
