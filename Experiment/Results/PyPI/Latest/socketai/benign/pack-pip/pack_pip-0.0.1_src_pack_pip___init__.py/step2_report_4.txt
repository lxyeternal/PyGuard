  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code only imports 'add' from 'cal' and 'version' from 'version'. No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious activity are present.\n- **Scores:** Confidence is perfect (1), obfuscated is 0, malware is 0, securityRisk is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Fully benign, straightforward import statements.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, only import statements with no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Confidence is 1, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1.\n- **Note:** The securityRisk is slightly above zero despite no suspicious code. This might reflect a conservative stance, but given the lack of any actual risk, it could be lowered.\n- **Verdict:** The minimal risk score (0.1) seems slightly high given the absence of any suspicious activity. I suggest lowering it to 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above—only import statements, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, only import statements with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9 (slightly less than perfect), obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1.\n- **Note:** Slightly lower confidence may reflect uncertainty due to the minimal code, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Verdict:** The securityRisk score could be lowered to 0, as no actual risk is present. Confidence could remain at 0.9, which is acceptable given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others—only import statements, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1.\n- **Verdict:** The same logic applies; risk score should be 0, confidence can stay at 0.8.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Adjustments:\n- The **malware** scores are all correctly at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- The **obfuscated** scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The **securityRisk** scores are slightly elevated (0.1) in some reports despite no evidence of risk. I recommend lowering these to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n- The **confidence** scores are generally appropriate, given the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no actual security risk based on the provided code)\n\n**Overall,** the code snippets are benign import statements with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores should reflect that.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my recommendations:**\n- Lower the `securityRisk` scores from 0.1 to 0 across all reports.\n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Maintain confidence scores as they are, given the clarity of the code.\n\nThis careful review confirms that the code is safe and typical for modular Python projects.",
