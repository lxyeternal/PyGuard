{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'add' from the 'cal' module and a variable 'version' from the 'version' module, likely for use in calculations or version tracking.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external modules 'cal' and 'version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident, as the code only contains import statements and no further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements with no further logic or data handling; no suspicious or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports from two modules, which is standard practice. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors are apparent. The minimal content and clear purpose suggest benign usage. The lack of additional code prevents any further risk assessment, but based solely on this fragment, no malicious activity is indicated.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple import statement with no malicious intent. There are no security risks or anomalies identified within this limited snippet.",
