{
  "purpose": "Import functions 'add' from the 'cal' module and 'version' from the 'version' module, likely for use in the larger project.",
  "sources": "Modules 'cal' and 'version' being imported.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or data output points are present in the given code snippet.",
  "flows": "Imported functions may be used elsewhere in the program; no direct data flows are observable from this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are evident in these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports of two functions or variables from separate modules. There are no indications of malicious activity, such as dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The minimal code suggests a standard practice of importing dependencies. Since only import statements are present, no security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet contains standard import statements with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a typical setup for further code execution, with no anomalies or security concerns detected.",
