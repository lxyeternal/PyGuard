{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions or variables from external modules named 'cal' and 'version'.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'cal' and 'version' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing shown in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imported data flows into the current module via 'add' and 'version'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements from two modules, 'cal' and 'version'. There is no further logic, data handling, or execution present. Without additional context or code, there are no apparent security risks or malicious behaviors. The import statements are typical in Python for modular code organization.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears benign, performing simple imports with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. Given the limited code, no malicious or suspicious behavior can be inferred.",
