{
  "purpose": "Extends Odoo's 'account.move.line' model to manage expense budget allocations and reversals based on move states and expense attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads expense_id, move_id, analytic_distribution, move.state, expense attributes, and environment models; accesses move and expense records.",
  "sinks": "Calls to expense.commit_budget() for budget adjustments; search().unlink() for record deletions.",
  "flows": "From expense_id and move data as sources, through condition checks and calculations, to commit_budget() or unlink() as sinks depending on move state and attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external network activity; standard ORM operations and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Odoo module extension managing expense and budget states. It performs typical database reads, condition checks, and record modifications. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The operations are controlled and aligned with business logic, with no signs of obfuscation or external malicious activity. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to data modifications, which are expected in such modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and aligns with standard expense management workflows. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
