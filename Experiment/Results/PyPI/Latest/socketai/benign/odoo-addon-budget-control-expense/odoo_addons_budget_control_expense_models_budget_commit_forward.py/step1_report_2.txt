{
  "purpose": "Extend the functionality of budget commitment forwarding to include expenses, with specific handling for 'hr.expense' documents.",
  "sources": "Reads from self.expense, doc.sheet_id, and doc._name; interacts with model fields and methods.",
  "sinks": "Uses dynamic data to generate document numbers and domain extensions, referencing expense records.",
  "flows": "Expense-related data flows from expense fields to document number and domain extension functions, potentially affecting query filtering.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; code appears standard for Odoo model extensions. No obfuscation or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Odoo model extension, adding expense handling features. It modifies document models to include expense documents and customizes document numbering and domain filtering based on expense state. The code does not include any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors are present. The use of dynamic domain and document number generation is standard for such extensions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward extension of an Odoo module to incorporate expense documents into budget commitments. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation appears safe and aligned with typical Odoo development practices.",
