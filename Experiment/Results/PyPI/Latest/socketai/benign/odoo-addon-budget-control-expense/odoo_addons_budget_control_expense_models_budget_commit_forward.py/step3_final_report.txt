  "purpose": "The code extends Odoo models to include 'hr.expense' handling, adding expense-related fields and overriding methods for document numbering and domain filtering.",
  "sources": "Reads class attributes, model fields, superclass methods, and expense-related data.",
  "sinks": "Generates document numbers, filters domains based on expense state, and references expense records.",
  "flows": "Expense data influences document number generation and domain filtering logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical extension of Odoo models, adding expense support via standard ORM fields and method overrides. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations. The logic is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard extension for expense management within Odoo, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are justified and accurate.",
