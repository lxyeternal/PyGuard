  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe extremely minimal code: a license comment and a single import statement.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies are identified.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger project, and the import is standard.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose and analysis are accurate.\n- Confidence is high (1).\n- Malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk is 0.1, possibly due to the license comment, but this is negligible.\n- No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar reasoning.\n- Confidence slightly lower (0.9), but justified.\n- Malware score remains 0.\n- Security risk remains low.\n- No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion.\n- Confidence is 1.\n- Malware score is 0.\n- Security risk is 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Consistent with others.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9).\n- Malware score 0.\n- Security risk 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Fully aligned with others.\n- Confidence is 1.\n- Malware score 0.\n- Security risk 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Are there any issues with the code?**  \n  No. The code is trivial, benign, and standard.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. Malware is 0 across all, which is correct given the code.  \n  Obfuscated is 0, which is also correct.\n\n- **Is the security risk score appropriate?**  \n  Given the minimal and benign nature, a security risk of 0.1 might be slightly high but still acceptable. It might reflect the presence of a license comment, but that is not a security concern.\n\n- **Should any scores be adjusted?**  \n  No. All scores seem appropriate.\n\n- **Any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 is acceptable, but could be lowered to 0 since the code is benign and minimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and well-reasoned. The code snippet is harmless, and the scoring aligns with the content. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or 0.1 if keeping the license comment as a minimal risk factor)\n\n**Final note:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
