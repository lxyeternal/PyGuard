  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only specifies a license and imports a single module from the same package. It does not contain any executable logic, input handling, or data processing. This minimal code snippet appears to be part of a larger codebase. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import statement with an open-source license declaration. No malicious intent or security risks are present based on this snippet.",
