  "purpose": "Minimal code with a license comment and a local import statement, indicating a standard module setup.",
  "sources": "The import statement from the local package (. import budget_monitor_report).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and typical for a Python module.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment and a simple import statement. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The import is from a local module, which is standard practice. No data flows, external interactions, or suspicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the minimal and benign nature of the code. Slight variations in risk scores are acceptable but could be standardized to 0 for consistency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. Minor score adjustments to set the risk score to 0 across all reports would improve consistency. Overall, the code poses no security concern.",
