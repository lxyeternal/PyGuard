  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code defines an Odoo model `expense.budget.move` that extends `base.budget.move`.\n   - It introduces related fields (`expense_id`, `sheet_id`, `move_id`, `move_line_id`) to link expenses, sheets, and accounting moves.\n   - The `_compute_reference` method sets the `reference` field to the `sheet_id` display name if `reference` is not already set.\n   - All fields and methods use standard Odoo ORM practices.\n   - No user input handling, external data fetching, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic.\n\n2. **Report Analysis:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or external data leaks.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is primarily data modeling with related fields and a simple computed method.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis — no malicious code or behavior is detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, standard code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in most reports, justified by the fact that, although no malicious activity is present, the code manages sensitive data relationships. Still, the risk is minimal.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n   - No issues are evident in the code or reports.\n   - The logic is simple, and no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond standard data modeling.\n   - The reference field is set based on related data, which is typical and not suspicious.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, standard for an Odoo module.\n   - The reports' scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, justified by data relationships, not a security concern)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured Odoo model with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No changes are recommended.",
