{
  "purpose": "Define an Odoo model for expense budget moves, linking expenses, sheets, and accounting entries.",
  "sources": "Reads from expense_id, sheet_id, move_line_id, and their related models; depends on sheet_id for reference calculation.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output, network calls, or external data effects.",
  "flows": "Reads data from expense_id, sheet_id, move_line_id; computes reference based on sheet_id display_name.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Odoo model defining relationships between expense, sheet, and account move records. It uses standard fields, relationships, and a dependency method to set a reference field. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The code adheres to typical Odoo development patterns and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Odoo model for expense budget movements with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
