  "purpose": "Standard Odoo model defining expense budget moves with related fields and a simple reference computation.",
  "sources": "Related fields: expense_id, sheet_id, move_id, move_line_id; data stored in related models.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal ORM relations only.",
  "flows": "Related fields link expense, sheet, move, and move line data; no external data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward ORM model with a simple computed method.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, benign Odoo ORM model with related fields and a basic computed method. It does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. All signals indicate no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard data model with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
