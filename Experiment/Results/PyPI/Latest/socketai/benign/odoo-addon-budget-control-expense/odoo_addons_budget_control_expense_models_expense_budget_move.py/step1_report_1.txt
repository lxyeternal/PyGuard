{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for expense budget movements in Odoo, including related fields and computed references.",
  "sources": "Reads from related fields such as expense_id.sheet_id, move_line_id.move_id, and possibly rec.reference if set elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no external data outputs or network communication.",
  "flows": "Related fields (expense_id.sheet_id, move_line_id.move_id) flow into computed reference; no external or malicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual dynamic behavior. Uses standard Odoo ORM features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Odoo model extending base.budget.move with related fields to other expense and accounting models. The _compute_reference method sets a reference based on related record data if not already set. No data inputs from user or external sources are processed in a way that suggests malicious intent. The code adheres to standard practices for defining ORM models and computed fields. There are no indications of obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Odoo model for expense budget management with no malicious or security-compromising elements detected. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious flows.",
