{
  "purpose": "Define an Odoo model for managing expense budget moves with related fields and a computed reference.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'expense_id', 'sheet_id', 'move_line_id', and 'reference' fields.",
  "targets": "Potentially modifies 'reference' field based on 'sheet_id'.",
  "flows": "Uses 'sheet_id' to compute 'reference' if not set, reading related records.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, no dynamic code execution, no external data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Odoo model with fields linking expense, sheet, move, and move line records. The only logic is a dependency on 'sheet_id' to compute 'reference' with a simple conditional. The code appears standard, utilizing typical Odoo ORM features. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows are present. It follows common patterns for data modeling and computed fields in Odoo modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward Odoo model definition with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard implementation for tracking expense budget movements.",
