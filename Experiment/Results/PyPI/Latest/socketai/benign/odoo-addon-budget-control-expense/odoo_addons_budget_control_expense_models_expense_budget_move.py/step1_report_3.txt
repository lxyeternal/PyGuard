{
  "purpose": "Define an Odoo model for managing expense budget moves, including related fields and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads from expense_id, expense_id.sheet_id, move_line_id.move_id, and potentially from self.reference.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data output points; the code does not send data externally.",
  "flows": "expense_id -> sheet_id -> reference field; move_line_id -> move_id (via related fields).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The _compute_reference method only assigns display names based on existing fields.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Odoo model with fields linked to other models via Many2one relations. The _compute_reference method depends on the sheet_id, updating the reference accordingly. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling or obfuscation. All code appears standard for an Odoo module defining data relations and computed fields.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Odoo model implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It serves to manage expense budget movements within the application context.",
