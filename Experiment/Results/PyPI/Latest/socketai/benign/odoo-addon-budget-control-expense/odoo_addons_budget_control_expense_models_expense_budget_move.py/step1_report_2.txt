  "purpose": "Define an Odoo model for managing expense budget moves, linking expenses, sheets, and accounting moves.",
  "sources": "Read operations on 'sheet_id', 'expense_id', and related 'move_line_id.move_id'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is written to external systems, nor are there outputs influenced by untrusted data.",
  "flows": "sheet_id (source) influences reference display name (sink) via _compute_reference method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or obfuscated code, and no use of external untrusted inputs or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up data models with relationships and a dependent computed field. It relies on internal database references and standard Odoo ORM methods. No user input handling, no external data fetching, and no suspicious logic are present. The '_compute_reference' method simply assigns a display name based on related records, which is standard practice in Odoo modules. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Odoo model definition for expense budget management with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely manages data relationships and display logic.",
