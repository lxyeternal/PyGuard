{
  "purpose": "This code extends the 'budget.monitor.report' model in Odoo to add custom expense source data and SQL query modifications for reporting.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Odoo models and methods, specifically from super()._get_consumed_sources(), self._select_statement(), self._from_statement(), self._where_expense(), and super()._get_sql().",
  "sinks": "The code constructs SQL query strings that could potentially be executed against the database; particularly, it formats SQL statements with parameters using the SQL class from odoo.tools.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model methods and SQL query components into the final SQL string that is returned for execution, primarily through string concatenation and parameterized SQL construction.",
  "anomalies": "The method _where_expense returns an empty SQL object, which might suggest incomplete or placeholder code. The code uses string concatenation to build SQL queries, but properly employs parameterized SQL with placeholders, reducing injection risk. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are observed. The use of the SQL class is standard in Odoo for safe query construction.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily extends existing functionality by adding additional data sources and constructing complex SQL queries in a standard, safe manner. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent. The use of parameterized queries via the SQL class suggests adherence to best practices. The only potential concern is the placeholder _where_expense method returning an empty SQL, which could lead to incomplete query logic but not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate extension of an Odoo module for reporting purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The use of parameterized SQL reduces injection risks. The empty _where_expense method may indicate incomplete implementation but does not introduce security vulnerabilities.",
