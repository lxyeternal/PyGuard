{
  "purpose": "Extend the 'budget.monitor.report' model to include additional expense data sources and construct SQL queries for reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "The method '_get_consumed_sources' reads data from internal methods and data structures; the method '_where_expense' is intended to generate SQL conditions but currently returns an empty SQL object.",
  "sinks": "The SQL query construction combines internal SQL fragments and parameters; no untrusted input is directly executed, and parameterization is used to mitigate injection risks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal methods '_select_statement' and '_from_statement' into the SQL query, combined with the output of '_where_expense', which currently is empty, into a union query.",
  "anomalies": "The '_where_expense' method returns an empty SQL object, which may indicate incomplete implementation but does not introduce malicious behavior. The reliance on external methods without provided implementations introduces some uncertainty.",
  "analysis": "The code extends an Odoo report model, adding an expense data source and constructing SQL queries using parameterized objects from 'odoo.tools.SQL'. The use of safe SQL practices reduces injection risk. The '_where_expense' method returning an empty SQL object suggests incomplete logic but not malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The external methods '_select_statement' and '_from_statement' are assumed to be controlled internal methods. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, safe extension with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe extension of an Odoo reporting model, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The placeholder '_where_expense' should be reviewed for completeness but does not pose a security threat. The use of parameterized SQL and controlled internal methods supports a benign assessment.",
