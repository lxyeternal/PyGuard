{
  "purpose": "This code extends an existing Odoo model 'budget.monitor.report' to include additional sources of expense data and constructs SQL queries for reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the method '_get_consumed_sources' and uses methods '_select_statement', '_from_statement', and '_get_sql' which are likely to access database or model data; also, it reads class attributes and method returns.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs SQL query strings which could be executed on the database, but does not execute or run raw input directly; it relies on internally generated SQL components.",
  "flows": "Sources include method calls and class attributes; data flows into SQL string construction via method parameters and internal function calls; the final SQL string could be executed on the database.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'SQL' object for constructing SQL queries suggests some abstraction over raw SQL; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obvious obfuscated code or dynamic code execution; the method '_where_expense' returns an empty SQL fragment, which might be intentional or incomplete but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is an extension of an Odoo model to add reporting features. It manipulates SQL query components by combining inherited SQL with additional UNION ALL statements. The use of the 'SQL' class from 'odoo.tools' indicates safe SQL construction, preventing SQL injection. No hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, and no suspicious network activity are evident. The '_where_expense' method returns an empty SQL object, which might be incomplete but isn't malicious. The code appears structured, using proper methods and conventions; there are no signs of malicious backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension of an Odoo model to enhance reporting with additional data sources. It safely constructs SQL queries using Odoo's 'SQL' helper and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or security risks is detected.",
