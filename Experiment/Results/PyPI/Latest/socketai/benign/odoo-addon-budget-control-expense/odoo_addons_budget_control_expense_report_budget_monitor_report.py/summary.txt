  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe extension of an Odoo reporting model, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The placeholder '_where_expense' should be reviewed for completeness but does not pose a security threat. The use of parameterized SQL and controlled internal methods supports a benign assessment."
