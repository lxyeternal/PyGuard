  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code extends an Odoo model for reporting, adding additional data sources and constructing SQL queries dynamically.\n- The code uses the `SQL` class from `odoo.tools` for parameterized SQL construction, which is a good security practice.\n- The method `_where_expense()` returns an empty SQL object in all reports, which might be placeholder or incomplete but not malicious.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, obfuscated code, or signs of malicious behavior are identified.\n- The code relies on internal methods (`_select_statement`, `_from_statement`) whose implementations are not provided, which introduces some uncertainty about input validation, but overall, the structure appears standard.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- None of the reports identify actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The potential concern about dynamic SQL construction is mitigated by the use of parameterized SQL objects.\n- The empty `_where_expense()` method is noted as possibly incomplete but not malicious.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal concern given the context.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.8–0.9), indicating trust in the assessment.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- Since the external methods `_select_statement`, `_from_statement`, and `_where_expense` are not provided, there is a slight uncertainty about input validation and potential injection points. However, the use of `SQL()` objects suggests adherence to safe practices.\n- The placeholder `_where_expense()` returning an empty SQL object could be a sign of incomplete implementation but does not introduce a security vulnerability.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code appears safe, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The risk and malware scores should remain at 0, given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to reliance on external methods and placeholder methods, but no significant security concern)\n\n**Final note:** The overall assessment confirms that this code is a standard, safe extension of an Odoo reporting model, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities evident from the provided snippets.",
