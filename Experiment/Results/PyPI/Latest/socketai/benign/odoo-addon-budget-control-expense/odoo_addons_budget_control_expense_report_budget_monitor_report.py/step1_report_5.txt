{
  "purpose": "The code extends an Odoo model to add custom SQL query components for budget monitoring, specifically handling expense sources and SQL query construction.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal methods and potentially from database models via inherited methods and SQL queries.",
  "sinks": "SQL string construction and concatenation, including the use of SQL() from odoo.tools.",
  "flows": "Method calls retrieve SQL fragments, which are concatenated into final SQL queries using SQL() objects, then executed or returned for execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of SQL() for dynamic SQL assembly is typical in Odoo; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious hardcoded secrets. The SQL() method is used safely with parameterization to avoid injection. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is an extension of an Odoo model, primarily constructing SQL queries dynamically. It combines inherited method outputs with custom SQL fragments for reporting purposes. No data leaks, credential exposure, or malicious network activity are evident. The use of SQL() indicates a standard practice of safe SQL composition with parameterization. No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malware behavior. The structure and logic follow common Odoo development patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate extension of an Odoo model, focusing on report generation with safe SQL handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malware. The code is well-structured and standard for its purpose.",
