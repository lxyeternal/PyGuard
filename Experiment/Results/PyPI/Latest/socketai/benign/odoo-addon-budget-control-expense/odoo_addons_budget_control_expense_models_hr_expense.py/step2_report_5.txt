  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence or absence of issues, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Extends expense models, manages budget moves, approval, and document workflows.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious external calls, no obfuscation, standard ORM usage, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (low).  \n**Assessment:** The low risk score aligns with the absence of malicious indicators. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar extension focusing on budget moves, approval, and expense management.\n- **Findings:** No external network activity, no suspicious code, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.  \n**Assessment:** The low risk and malware scores are justified. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Extends expense models, handles budget validation, and approval workflows.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, external calls, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.  \n**Assessment:** The scoring is consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on expense workflows, budget checks, and approval processes.\n- **Findings:** No external interactions, no suspicious code, standard ORM usage.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.  \n**Assessment:** The low risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard extension of expense models, with budget and approval workflows.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or external calls.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting typical business logic extension, which is low risk.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, **none of the reports show signs of malware or obfuscation**. The scores are reasonable and aligned with the content.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, typical of business logic extensions)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent, well-justified, and correctly scored. No adjustments needed. The code appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
