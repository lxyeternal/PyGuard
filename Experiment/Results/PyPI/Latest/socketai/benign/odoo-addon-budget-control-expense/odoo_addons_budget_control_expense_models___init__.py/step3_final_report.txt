  "purpose": "Import statements for internal modules related to budget, accounting, and expenses.",
  "sources": "The import statements themselves, which load internal modules without external input or dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports internal modules.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks as the code is static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard import pattern with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for internal modules, with a license comment. There is no dynamic code, external input, network activity, or data processing. The imports are straightforward and benign, typical of a module initializer or package structure. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports (0.1) is likely overly cautious; given the static nature and internal scope, the risk is effectively zero. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score 0, and overall security risk negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The import statements are standard and safe. The scores assigned are appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
