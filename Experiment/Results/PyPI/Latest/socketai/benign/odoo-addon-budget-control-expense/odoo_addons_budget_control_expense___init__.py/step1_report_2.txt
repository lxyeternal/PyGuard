  "purpose": "Import modules related to models, reports, and wizard functionalities, likely part of a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: models, report, wizard",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present; no untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only contains import statements",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only import statements with no execution logic, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports three local modules: models, report, and wizard, with no other logic or data handling. The license declaration is standard and does not influence security. There are no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoors. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement snippet with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It appears to be part of a normal modular application.",
