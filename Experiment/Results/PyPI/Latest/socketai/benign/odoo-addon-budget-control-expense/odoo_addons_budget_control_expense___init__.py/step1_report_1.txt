  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a larger Python module, likely for an application that manages models, reports, and wizards.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: models, report, wizard",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow observed in this snippet; it only imports modules",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license declaration and three import statements from local modules. There are no dynamic executions, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The import of local modules suggests modular design typical for large applications. No signs of malware or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import statement with no malicious or security risks detected. It appears to be a standard part of a larger application framework.",
