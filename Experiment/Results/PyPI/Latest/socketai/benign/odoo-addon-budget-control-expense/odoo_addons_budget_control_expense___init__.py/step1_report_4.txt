{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package, likely an Odoo module or similar, that imports internal components such as models, report, and wizard.",
  "sources": "Imports from the current package (__init__.py style), which are not sources of external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is being processed, stored, or outputted to untrusted environments.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, no processing of untrusted data, or external communication flows evident in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard import statements; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward __init__.py file that initializes the module by importing its components. No runtime logic, external data input, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code structure is typical for Python packages, especially in frameworks like Odoo.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any code that could be exploited or used maliciously. The minimalistic nature and standard pattern suggest no malicious intent.",
