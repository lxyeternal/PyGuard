  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules (`models`, `report`, `wizard`).\n- No runtime logic, data processing, external communication, or obfuscation is present.\n- The license header (AGPL-3.0) is standard for open-source projects and does not imply malicious intent.\n- No signs of malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code snippets are minimal and typical for modular Python applications, especially in frameworks like Odoo.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is just import statements with no apparent issues.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning?**  \n  No. The reasoning in all reports is sound and consistent with the code.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n  - Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n  - Malware scores are 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n  - Security risks are minimal or zero, which is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of scores:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The majority assign 0 or very low (0.1). Given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities, these are appropriate.\n\n- **Potential over/underestimation?**  \n  No. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code is an `__init__.py` or module entry point, its role is purely to import submodules.  \n- No assumptions about hidden malicious code are warranted here.  \n- The license header is standard and does not influence security assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 or 0.1 (appropriate; minimal risk)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, just a standard module import setup)\n\nThis matches the assessments in the reports and aligns with the code's simplicity and transparency.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are justified and consistent across the reviews.",
