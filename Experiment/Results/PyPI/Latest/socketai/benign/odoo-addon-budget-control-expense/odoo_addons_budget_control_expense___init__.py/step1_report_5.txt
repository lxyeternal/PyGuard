{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a larger Python module, importing submodules such as models, report, and wizard.",
  "sources": "Imports submodules within the package, which may load code or data when the package is used.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data handling functions are present; no untrusted data processing or external communication is evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is identifiable; imports are static and do not process runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with standard package structure; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports internal submodules, likely for modular functionality. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. As such, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and typical of Python package initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement setup for a Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. The risk is negligible.",
