  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments, scores, and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code snippet is minimal: only license declaration and three import statements.\n- All reports correctly identify that there is no runtime logic, data flow, or external interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be a standard module initialization or import setup, typical for frameworks like Odoo or similar.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \nYes. All reports accurately describe the code as a simple import statement with no malicious or security risks.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning?**  \nNo. All reports are consistent and reasonable in their analysis.\n\n**Scores review:**\n\n- **Confidence:** Mostly 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Ranges from 0 to 0.1, which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis that no malicious activity is present.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above 0 in some reports (0.1), possibly reflecting the minimal risk of import-based modules if misused, but given the simplicity, this is acceptable.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. Given the code's simplicity, the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are made, only that the code is benign.\n- No false positives or assumptions about malicious intent are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n  (No malicious activity detected or implied.)\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n  (Code is clear and straightforward.)\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 to 0.1  \n  (Minimal, given the code's nature; I would set it at 0.0, as the code itself does not introduce any security concern.)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nI agree with the current assessments. The code is benign, and the security risk is negligible. No changes needed.",
