  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of straightforward import statements from local modules (`models`, `report`, `wizard`).\n- No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be part of a modular Python application, possibly an Odoo module or similar.\n- No external data handling, no runtime logic, and no signs of malicious activity are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  The code is minimal and only contains import statements. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in this snippet.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in report logic:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and non-malicious.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n  - Malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n  - Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- **Malware score (0):**  \n  The code contains only import statements with no suspicious behavior. No malware or malicious intent is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated score (0):**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Given the benign nature, a very low risk score (0 or 0.1) is appropriate. The minimal risk is due to the code being part of a larger package, but the snippet itself is safe.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- No issues are present; all assessments are accurate.\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions and stick to observable facts.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n**Based on the provided reports and the code snippet:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Score | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score   | **0**             | No malicious activity or code detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated Score| **0**             | Code is clear, no obfuscation present.                       |\n| Risk Score      | **0.1**           | Very minimal, considering the code's context within a package. |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and standard.**  \nNo further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a typical import setup with no security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate, and I agree with their assessments.",
