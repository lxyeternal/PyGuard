  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package installation using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; relies on setup configuration parameters if provided elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or source-to-sink flow observed in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "Code is extremely minimal; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation or complex logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setup function from setuptools and calls setup() with no arguments. This is a standard minimal setup script used for packaging Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. It does not perform any actions beyond invoking the setup process.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical minimal setup configuration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended for standard package installation purposes.",
