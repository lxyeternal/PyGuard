  "purpose": "This code is intended to define package installation settings using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the setup() call executes without data input.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no suspicious or unusual constructs; the setup() function is called with default parameters, which is common in package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() without arguments. This is typical in minimal setup scripts used for Python packaging. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling. The script's simplicity reduces the risk of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard minimal setup script for Python packages with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
