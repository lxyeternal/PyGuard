  "purpose": "Defines a module that imports TinyImageNet from a dataset package and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "The code reads a module import from .dataset and assigns a version string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; no flow from source to sink identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hidden or suspicious constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a dataset class and sets a version string, which are standard practices. There are no indications of malicious behavior, no external network activity, or suspicious code paths. The import is relative and appears to be part of a larger package. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module definition with a version string and an import statement. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
