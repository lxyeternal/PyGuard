  "purpose": "Minimal module import and version declaration, likely part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module '.dataset', static version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "Import of local module, no data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local dataset module and sets a version string. It contains no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The import is from a relative local module, typical in package development. The static version string is harmless. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence levels. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. All reports are accurate and consistent with the code content. No modifications are necessary.",
