{
  "purpose": "Import all definitions from the WebsocketServer module, likely to utilize websocket functionalities within the project.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are directly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; it does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the import brings symbols into the namespace but does not execute code or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported components, but no malicious or suspicious code is evident in this line.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the WebsocketServer module. This practice is discouraged due to potential namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious. No code execution, data leakage, or obfuscation is present. The security risk depends on the content of the imported module, which is not provided. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, given the straightforward import statement. The risk score is low (around 0.2), reflecting concerns about wildcard imports but not indicating immediate danger. Confidence in this assessment is moderate to high, as the code is simple and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and does not contain malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious components if the module is compromised. No evidence suggests malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and a low risk score around 0.2. It is recommended to review the contents of 'WebsocketServer' for security, especially if the module is untrusted or third-party.",
