{
  "purpose": "The code imports all definitions from the WebsocketServer module, likely to set up or manage websocket connections.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package: 'from .WebsocketServer import *'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the import itself is not a sink but may lead to execution of code in the WebsocketServer module when used.",
  "flows": "The flow depends on how the imported WebsocketServer is used later; the import simply makes its contents available.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be suspicious as it obscures what is imported, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a relative import from the WebsocketServer module. There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors present. The import could be used to facilitate websocket functionality, which is common in server applications. The lack of further code limits the ability to detect malicious intent definitively. Given the minimal context, this appears standard but warrants further review of the WebsocketServer module itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet performs a basic import from a module named WebsocketServer. On its own, it does not contain malicious behavior but the use of 'import *' can be considered a minor security concern for obscurity. Further review of the WebsocketServer module is recommended to ensure its safety.",
