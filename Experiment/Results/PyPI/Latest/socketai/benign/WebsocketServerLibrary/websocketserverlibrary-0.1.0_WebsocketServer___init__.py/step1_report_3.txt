{
  "purpose": "The code imports all components from the WebsocketServer module, likely for implementing websocket server functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement indicates source data could come from the WebsocketServer module, which may include network data, client inputs, or other runtime data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include any functions or methods called within the imported WebsocketServer module that handle data processing, network communication, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs (clients or network) through the WebsocketServer module into application logic; the imported module may process or forward data to other system components.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no additional logic or obfuscation. No signs of hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs an import of a module named WebsocketServer. Without further code or context, it is a straightforward import statement. It does not contain any malicious code or behavior on its own. Since WebsocketServer likely handles network communications, its security depends on its internal implementation, but nothing suspicious is evident here. The import pattern is standard and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks apparent. Its security implications depend on the imported module's internal code, which cannot be assessed here.",
