  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports are about the same code snippet: `from .WebsocketServer import *` (or similar).\n- The code is a simple relative import with a wildcard, which is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n- No actual code execution, data handling, or network activity is shown in these snippets.\n- The reports consistently assign low malware scores (0) and low security risks (~0.1–0.3), which aligns with the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code is just an import statement; **no malicious code or vulnerabilities are present in this snippet**.\n- The use of `import *` is a bad practice, as it obscures what is imported, but it does not directly cause security issues unless the imported module is malicious or compromised.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports generally recognize the use of `import *` as a bad practice but not malicious.\n- They assign a `malware` score of 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are low, which is consistent.\n- The confidence levels are moderate (0.6–0.8), which seems reasonable given the limited context.\n\n**No significant logical flaws or mistakes** are evident in the reasoning. They correctly identify that without inspecting the `WebsocketServer` module, no malicious activity can be confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review and justification:\n\n**Malware score:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate.\n- Since the code is only an import statement with no embedded malicious code, this score should remain at 0.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n- All reports assign `obfuscated: 0`.\n- The code is straightforward; no obfuscation is present.\n\n**Security risk score:**\n- Ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 across reports.\n- Given the minimal code, this is reasonable. The use of wildcard import is a concern but not a security risk per se.\n\n**Potential for change:**\n- I agree with the current scores; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- **Not applicable here**. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that.\n\n### Challenges to assumptions:\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the reports are cautious and acknowledge the limitations.\n- They correctly state that the security implications depend on the content of `WebsocketServer`, which is not provided.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No anomalies or contradictions are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.3 (low, due to use of `import *` but not dangerous)\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code snippet is a simple, standard import statement with no malicious activity. The main concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide imported components and potentially facilitate malicious code if the module is compromised, but there's no evidence of that here.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to reflect the minor concern about import practices)\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Review the contents of `WebsocketServer` for security, especially if it is a third-party or untrusted module.\n- Avoid using `import *` in production code to improve clarity and security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign but should be reviewed for best practices. The scores are appropriate, and no major adjustments are necessary.",
