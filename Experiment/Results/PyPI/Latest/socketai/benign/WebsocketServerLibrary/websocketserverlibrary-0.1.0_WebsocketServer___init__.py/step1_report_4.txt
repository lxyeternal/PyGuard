  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the WebsocketServer module, likely to facilitate WebSocket server functionalities within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.WebsocketServer)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external communication shown",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; only a module import is present",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) can obscure what is being imported, but this is not inherently malicious; no other anomalies present",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with a relative import syntax. It indicates reliance on a local module named WebsocketServer. No data handling, network activity, or malicious code is visible. The use of wildcard import might hinder code clarity but is not malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a minimal, standard import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security issues. It simply brings in functionality from a local module, which is common practice in Python projects.",
