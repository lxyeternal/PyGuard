  "purpose": "Import all classes, functions, and variables from the WebsocketServer module in the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package importing WebsocketServer",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; depends on how imported components are used elsewhere in the codebase",
  "flows": "Potential use of imported components from WebsocketServer, but no explicit data flow shown in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can obscure which components are imported, increasing risk of hidden malicious code or conflicts; no other anomalies detected from this line alone",
  "analysis": "This code performs a relative import of all symbols from the WebsocketServer module. The wildcard import can hide which specific parts are imported, potentially importing malicious or unintended code if the module is compromised. However, this snippet alone does not contain executable logic or evidence of malicious activity. The actual risk depends on the content of WebsocketServer. The code itself is minimal and standard, with no explicit security issues, but the use of wildcard import is considered bad practice and could facilitate malicious code inclusion if the module is malicious or compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no immediate malicious behavior. The use of wildcard import warrants caution, as it can hide malicious code or unintended behavior if the imported module is compromised. Overall, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity in this snippet, but the import style should be reviewed in context.",
