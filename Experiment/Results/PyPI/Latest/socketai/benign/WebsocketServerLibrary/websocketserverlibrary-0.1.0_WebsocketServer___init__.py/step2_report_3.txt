  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom .WebsocketServer import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### **General observations:**\n- The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the `WebsocketServer` module.\n- No other code, data, or logic is present.\n- Use of `import *` is generally discouraged due to obscurity and potential for hidden imports.\n- The security implications depend heavily on the contents of `WebsocketServer`, which are not provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import all definitions from `WebsocketServer`.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.6\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, just an import. Minor concern about `import *`.\n- **Assessment:** The score seems reasonable. The risk is low; the confidence is moderate.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.6\n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Import for websocket functionality.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.8\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity; the module's internal code is unknown, but the import alone is benign.\n- **Verdict:** The risk score could be slightly lower (e.g., 0.1), but 0.1 is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.7\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; just an import.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3, confidence=0.6\n- **Analysis:** Use of wildcard import can be risky if the module is compromised, but on its own, it's not malicious.\n- **Verdict:** The risk score of 0.3 is reasonable, considering the potential for hidden imports.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the import alone does not indicate malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations, but generally low, reflecting the minimal risk of this import statement itself.\n- **Confidence:** Moderate to high, as the import pattern is clear.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n- Since the content of `WebsocketServer` is unknown, the risk scores could be slightly conservative, but given the data, they are reasonable.\n- The use of `import *` is a known bad practice but not inherently malicious; it warrants caution but not a high risk score.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Based on the provided reports and code snippet, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (small concern due to wildcard import, but generally low risk)\n- **Confidence:** **0.7** (moderate confidence in these assessments)\n\n**Note:** The actual security impact hinges on the internal implementation of `WebsocketServer`. If it contains malicious code, the risk could be higher, but based solely on the import statement, the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which should be flagged for review in the context of the full module.\n- No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and consider a slightly higher risk score if the context of `WebsocketServer` is unknown or untrusted.",
