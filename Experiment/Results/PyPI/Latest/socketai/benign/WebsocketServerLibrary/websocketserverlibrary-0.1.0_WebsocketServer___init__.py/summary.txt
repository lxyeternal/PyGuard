  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and does not contain malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious components if the module is compromised. No evidence suggests malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and a low risk score around 0.2. It is recommended to review the contents of 'WebsocketServer' for security, especially if the module is untrusted or third-party."
