  "purpose": "Import all classes, functions, or variables from the WebsocketServer module in the current package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the WebsocketServer module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this single line of import; no untrusted data is being processed or executed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as this is only an import statement without further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a wildcard import (*) can be considered a bad practice as it makes code harder to analyze and can introduce hidden dependencies, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import of all contents from a local module named WebsocketServer. There are no embedded malicious behaviors, data leaks, or suspicious constructs in this line. However, wildcard imports can sometimes hide malicious or unintended code if the module itself is compromised. Without inspecting the WebsocketServer module, no malicious activity can be confirmed. This line alone does not show any malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior. The use of wildcard import is not recommended but does not indicate malicious intent by itself.",
