{
  "purpose": "Implement a basic WebSocket server that handles client connections, message framing, and handshake procedures.",
  "sources": "Input sources include client handshake requests and WebSocket frames received via socket.recv().",
  "sinks": "Outputs include socket.send() for handshake responses and framed messages sent to clients.",
  "flows": "Input data (handshake request) flows through create_accept_key and parse_websocket_frame functions, leading to socket.send() responses. Message data from clients flows from recv() to parse_websocket_frame(), then to _message_received().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious domain connections, or malicious obfuscation detected. Functions such as create_accept_key and parse_websocket_frame are standard for WebSocket protocols. No dynamic code execution or unusual variable misuse observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard WebSocket server functionality, including handshake handling, frame parsing, and message sending. The create_accept_key method correctly generates the Sec-WebSocket-Accept key. parse_websocket_frame correctly processes masked and unmasked frames. The server uses threading for concurrent client handling. No suspicious code behaviors such as network exfiltration, data leakage, or hidden backdoors are present. The code appears to follow standard protocols without malicious modifications or obfuscation. All data flows are consistent with expected WebSocket operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical WebSocket server implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard protocol operations securely. No malware, data exfiltration, or sabotage features are detected.",
