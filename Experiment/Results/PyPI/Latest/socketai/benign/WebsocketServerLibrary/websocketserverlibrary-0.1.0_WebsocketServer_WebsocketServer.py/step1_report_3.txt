  "purpose": "A WebSocket server implementation for handling client connections, message framing, and communication over a network.",
  "sources": "Reads incoming socket data during handshake and message reception; reads environment variables if set outside the code (not shown here).",
  "sinks": "Sends handshake response, WebSocket frames, and server status messages via socket.send(); potential for data leakage if malicious data is sent.",
  "flows": "Receives handshake request → generates accept key → sends handshake response → receives data frames → parses frames → processes messages → can send framed messages back.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors detected. No suspicious external domain connections or system modifications present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard WebSocket server procedures, including handshake and message framing, with configurable callback functions. It uses standard Python libraries without any obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or cryptojacking. The only potential concern is the handling of socket data and callbacks, which are implemented securely and with no evident malicious intent. The code appears to be a straightforward, conventional WebSocket server implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard WebSocket server without any malicious features or behavior. It does not exhibit any malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks based on the provided implementation.",
