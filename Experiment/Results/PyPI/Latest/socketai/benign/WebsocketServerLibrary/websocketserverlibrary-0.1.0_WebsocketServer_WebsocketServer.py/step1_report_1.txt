{
  "purpose": "Implement a WebSocket server that handles client connections, message framing, and communication using standard WebSocket protocol procedures.",
  "sources": "Reading incoming HTTP handshake request, receiving WebSocket frames from clients, accessing socket data.",
  "sinks": "Sending handshake responses, sending framed messages to clients, closing sockets.",
  "flows": "HTTP request parsing -> handshake acceptance -> WebSocket frame parsing -> message handling -> socket closure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external connections, no data leakage mechanisms, no backdoors or covert channels present. Code appears to follow standard WebSocket protocol without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic WebSocket server with functions for handshake, message framing, and client handling. It correctly generates accept keys, parses frames, and manages client connections. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as unauthorized data exfiltration, hidden network communication, or backdoors. The use of threading for concurrency is standard. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or secret data are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a WebSocket server without malicious intent. It follows typical protocol procedures and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior based on the provided code. No security risks or malware signals identified.",
