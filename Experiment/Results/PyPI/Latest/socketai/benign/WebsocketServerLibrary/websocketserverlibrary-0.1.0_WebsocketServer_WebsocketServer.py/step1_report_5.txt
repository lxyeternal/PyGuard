  "purpose": "Implement a WebSocket server that handles client connections, message framing, and handshake processes.",
  "sources": "Reads incoming socket data during connection handshake, message reception, and socket recv calls.",
  "sinks": "Sends handshake response, framed messages, and handles socket send operations.",
  "flows": "Input socket data (handshake request or WebSocket frames) flows to parsing functions, then to message handling functions, with outgoing data for handshake responses and framed messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors detected. The code appears standard for WebSocket implementation. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical WebSocket server with standard procedures for handshake, message framing, and client management. Functions for handling new clients, disconnections, and message reception are placeholders and should be implemented properly. No malicious or maliciously crafted code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior identified. The code relies on standard Python libraries and does not contain any suspicious network calls or data leaks. It performs expected socket operations and message handling in a straightforward manner. The creation of accept keys uses standard hashlib and base64 functions, with no hardcoded secrets or secrets extraction. No evidence of malware or malicious data exfiltration is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign WebSocket server implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is structured properly, with no anomalies or suspicious features. Proper implementations of the placeholder methods are necessary for full operational use but do not impact security analysis.",
