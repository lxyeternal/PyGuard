{
  "purpose": "This code implements a standard WebSocket server with handshake, message framing, and client management, designed for real-time communication.",
  "sources": "The server reads incoming handshake requests via socket.recv(), and incoming WebSocket frames via socket.recv() during message handling.",
  "sinks": "Parsed messages are passed to the _message_received callback; outgoing messages are sent via socket.send() after framing.",
  "flows": "Handshake request received -> create_accept_key() generates response -> socket.send() sends handshake response -> subsequent frames received -> parse_websocket_frame() extracts message -> _message_received() invoked -> send() frames and transmits messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external connections, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors detected. Placeholder methods are unimplemented but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements WebSocket protocol procedures, including handshake, frame parsing, and message framing. It uses threading for concurrency and provides hooks for custom behavior. No malicious or suspicious code is present; the implementation aligns with standard practices. The placeholder methods (_new_client, _client_left, _message_received) are intended for extension and do not introduce security risks. No obfuscation or malicious activity is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign WebSocket server implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments across reports are consistent and justified.",
