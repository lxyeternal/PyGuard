  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward WebSocket server with correct handshake, framing, and client management. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues detected. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The code implements standard WebSocket procedures, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The scoring (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard implementation, no backdoors, suspicious code, or obfuscation. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No issues detected. The security risk score (0.1) is low but acceptable for a standard server.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard WebSocket server functions, no hardcoded secrets, suspicious external connections, or malicious code. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code is a typical implementation, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard procedures, no anomalies or malicious behavior. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears benign and correctly implemented.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard WebSocket server, placeholder functions for client handling, no malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is a typical WebSocket server implementation, with no evident vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation. All reports agree on this point.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent in the reports. They uniformly conclude the code is benign.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of malicious behavior.\n  - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, standard implementation.\n  - **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent security risk in a server code, but no significant vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:** No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious activity are made; the analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — No obfuscation or code hiding present.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Slight inherent risk typical for server code; no exploitable vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign WebSocket server implementation with no malicious or suspicious features.**",
