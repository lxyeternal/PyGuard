  "purpose": "Implement a WebSocket server that handles client connections, framing, and messaging.",
  "sources": "Reads incoming WebSocket handshake request, WebSocket frames, and socket data from clients.",
  "sinks": "Sending handshake responses, WebSocket frames, and messages to clients via socket.send().",
  "flows": "Handshake request received -> accept key generated -> handshake response sent -> incoming frames parsed -> messages processed and responded to.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious functions present. No evidence of malicious code, code injection, or privacy leaks. The code appears standard for a WebSocket server implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation of a WebSocket server, including handshake processing, message framing, and threading for handling multiple clients. Functions for setting callbacks are present but not used internally to perform any malicious actions. The message parsing and framing are consistent with WebSocket protocols. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. The use of threading is typical, and no obfuscation or malicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward WebSocket server implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for a server handling WebSocket connections, with no anomalous or malicious behavior detected.",
