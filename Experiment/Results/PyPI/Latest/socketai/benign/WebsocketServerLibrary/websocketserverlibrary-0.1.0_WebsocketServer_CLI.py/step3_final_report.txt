{
  "purpose": "Set up a WebSocket server with user-defined callback functions and launch an interactive console exposing the environment.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for server name, host, port; user-defined callback functions; environment variables; imported modules.",
  "sinks": "The interactive console (`code.InteractiveConsole`) which can execute arbitrary code; dynamic globals assignment via `globals()`.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence server creation and callback assignment; environment variables and globals are accessible in the console; console can execute arbitrary code affecting the environment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `globals()` for dynamic variable assignment based on user input; launching an interactive console exposing the environment; no input validation on command-line args; no sanitization or access control for console.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically creates a WebSocket server instance based on user input, assigns callback functions, and launches an embedded interactive console exposing the environment. While there is no malicious payload or obfuscated code, the use of `globals()` for dynamic variable creation and the embedded console pose significant security risks if exposed to untrusted users. The console allows arbitrary code execution, which could lead to system compromise. The code does not contain malware or malicious payloads, but its design inherently introduces security vulnerabilities. The primary concern is environment exposure rather than malicious intent within the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard server setup with significant security considerations due to the interactive console and dynamic globals, but it does not contain malicious code or payloads. The main risk arises from potential misuse if the console is accessible to untrusted users. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscated score is zero; the security risk score should be high (~0.75) reflecting the environment's exposure risk.",
