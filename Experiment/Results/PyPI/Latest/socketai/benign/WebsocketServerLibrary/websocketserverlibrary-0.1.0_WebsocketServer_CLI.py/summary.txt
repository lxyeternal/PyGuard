  "conclusion": "The script is a standard server setup with significant security considerations due to the interactive console and dynamic globals, but it does not contain malicious code or payloads. The main risk arises from potential misuse if the console is accessible to untrusted users. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscated score is zero; the security risk score should be high (~0.75) reflecting the environment's exposure risk."
