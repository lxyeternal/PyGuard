  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and assess the scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code dynamically creates a server instance based on user input via `globals()`, which is inherently risky if inputs are untrusted.\n- The use of `code.InteractiveConsole` to launch an interactive shell that exposes the environment is a significant security concern because it allows arbitrary code execution.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are explicitly present.\n- The main security risks stem from the environment's design, not from malicious code embedded within.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code sets up a WebSocket server, assigns callbacks, and launches an interactive console. No malicious activity is detected; risks are from dynamic globals and console exposure.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — **Reasonable**, no malware.\n- **Security risk:** 0.4 — **Moderate**, due to globals() and console.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear code.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The moderate security risk is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the potential risks of globals() and interactive console.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — **Appropriate**.\n- **Security risk:** 0.3 — Slightly lower, but still significant.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent. The reasoning is sound; the risk score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the high security risk due to dynamic globals and interactive console, noting the environment's potential for misuse.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — **Correct**, no malware.\n- **Security risk:** 0.9 — **High**, justified because of arbitrary code execution capability.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** The high risk score is justified given the environment's capabilities. The reasoning is valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizes the risk of arbitrary code execution via console.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — **Appropriate**.\n- **Security risk:** 0.75 — High, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Concludes that the code is standard, with no malicious payloads, and the main concern is the interactive console's potential for misuse.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — **Correct**.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — Low, reflecting minimal risk if environment is secured.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Reasoning is consistent; the low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusions:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or payload.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all, as code is clear.\n- **Risk scores:** Varying from 0.2 to 0.9, depending on emphasis on environment risks. The highest (0.9) in Report 3 is justified due to the high potential for arbitrary code execution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- The reports are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The scores are reasonable, with the exception of the very high risk score in Report 3, which is justified.\n- The main security concern is the use of `globals()` and `code.InteractiveConsole`, which can be exploited if the environment is exposed to untrusted users.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** ~0.75 — Considering the environment's potential for misuse, especially if the console is accessible to untrusted users.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The primary security concern is environment exposure, not malicious code embedded within. Proper safeguards (e.g., restricting console access, validating inputs) are necessary to mitigate risks.",
