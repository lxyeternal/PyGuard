  "purpose": "To set up and run a WebSocket server with customizable callback functions.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from command-line arguments parsed by argparse; server host and port are provided by user input.",
  "sinks": "The server instance is stored in a global variable based on user input; the interactive console allows code execution with access to globals.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> server creation -> callback functions assignment -> interactive console execution with access to globals.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of globals() to assign server instance dynamically based on user input, and launching an interactive console that exposes local environment. No direct use of untrusted input in critical security-sensitive operations beyond standard command-line parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a WebsocketServer module and creates a server instance based on command-line parameters. It assigns callback functions for client events and starts an interactive console. The server instance name is determined by user input via command-line arguments, stored in globals(), which could potentially be manipulated to override or shadow existing variables. The interactive console, provided by code.InteractiveConsole, exposes the globals dictionary, which includes server object references, allowing arbitrary code execution in the context of the script. No malicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The dynamic assignment via globals() and the interactive console pose potential risks of code injection or misuse if misused by an attacker.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to set up and run a WebSocket server with user-specified configurations. While it does not contain explicit malicious behavior, the use of globals() for dynamic variable assignment and the interactive console can be risky if misused, as they allow arbitrary code execution and manipulation of server objects. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent beyond these security considerations.",
