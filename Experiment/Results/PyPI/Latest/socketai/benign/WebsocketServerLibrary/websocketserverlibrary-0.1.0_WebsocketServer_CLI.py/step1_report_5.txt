{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and runs a WebSocket server with customizable callback functions for client connection, disconnection, and message receipt, providing an interactive console for server management.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for server configuration, imports external modules (code, sys, argparse, WebsocketServer), and initializes the WebSocket server object.",
  "sinks": "Uses globals() to assign server instance, calls methods on the server object, and initiates an interactive console; no direct untrusted data sink evident.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> server setup via ws.WebsocketServer -> callback functions (client_left, message_received, new_client) -> interactive console, no untrusted data flow outside inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of globals() for dynamic variable assignment; reliance on an interactive console which can execute arbitrary code; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious strings; standard library functions used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily initializes a WebSocket server with user-defined callback functions, based on command-line arguments. The use of 'globals()' for dynamic server naming is flexible but potentially risky if untrusted input is provided for server_name; however, in normal operation, it is controlled by the user. The interactive console allows code execution within the script's context, which is intended for server management but could be exploited if misused or exposed improperly. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious external network activity. The code does not perform data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or contain obfuscated/malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for a WebSocket server with configurable callbacks and an interactive console. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from the provided code. The use of an interactive console could pose security concerns if improperly exposed, but within this context, it is for server management. Overall, low suspicion of malware or malicious behavior.",
