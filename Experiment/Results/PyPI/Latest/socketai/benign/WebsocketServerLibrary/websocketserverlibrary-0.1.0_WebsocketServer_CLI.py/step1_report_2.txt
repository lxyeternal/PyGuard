  "purpose": "This script sets up and configures a WebSocket server instance with user-defined callback functions.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for server name, host, and port; imports WebsocketServer module; accesses sys and code modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses dynamic global variable assignment to create server instances; calls methods on WebsocketServer objects; initiates an interactive console.",
  "flows": "Command-line inputs → dynamic server instance creation → method calls to set callback functions → starting server → launching interactive console.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'globals()' for dynamic variable assignment; launching an interactive console with 'code.InteractiveConsole', which could allow code execution if exploited.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines callback functions for client connection, disconnection, and message receipt. It uses argparse to parse command-line arguments for server configuration. The server instance is created dynamically using the server name provided, and callback functions are set via method calls. It then starts an interactive console for further user interaction. The use of 'globals()' for dynamic variable assignment and launching an interactive console are potential security concerns, as they can allow execution of arbitrary code if manipulated maliciously. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or malicious code injection is present. The code appears primarily to be a configurable server setup with an interactive interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or malicious behavior but includes potentially unsafe practices such as dynamic global variables and an interactive console, which could be exploited if manipulated. It is a typical server setup script with moderate security considerations.",
