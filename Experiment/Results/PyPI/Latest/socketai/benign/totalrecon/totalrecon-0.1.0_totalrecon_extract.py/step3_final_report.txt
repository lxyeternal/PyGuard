  "purpose": "Extracts domain names, email addresses, S3 buckets, and recon summaries from text, PDFs, and TXT files for reconnaissance purposes.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns for domains, emails, S3 URLs; file reading operations; external summarize_recon function.",
  "sinks": "None; data is only extracted and summarized, no data leaks or external transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Input text or file content → regex extraction and summarize_recon → output data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external summarize_recon function without implementation details; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard regex-based extraction and file reading with error handling. External libraries used are common and benign. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The summarize_recon function's behavior is unknown but assumed benign based on context. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign analysis. No anomalies or malicious indicators are identified. The code's purpose aligns with reconnaissance data collection, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data extraction utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. External dependencies are standard, and no suspicious activity is evident. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
