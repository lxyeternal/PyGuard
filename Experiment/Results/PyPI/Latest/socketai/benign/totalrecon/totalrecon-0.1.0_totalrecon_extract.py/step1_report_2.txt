  "purpose": "Extract recon data such as domains, emails, S3 buckets, and summaries from text, PDFs, and TXT files.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for extract_from_text, extract_from_pdf (file path), extract_from_txt (file path); reading text content from PDF pages and text files.",
  "sinks": "Data returned in dictionaries; no untrusted data is written or transmitted; external libraries (fitz, totalrecon.ai) are used but do not perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from files or passed as text; regular expressions parse domains, emails, buckets; summaries generated via summarize_recon; data is returned as structured JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code uses external libraries appropriately without any suspicious behavior. No network calls or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data extraction tasks, utilizing regex for pattern matching and external libraries for PDF processing and summarization. No dangerous data flows, code injections, or malicious activities are evident. The only external interactions are reading files and invoking functions that appear to process data locally. Summarization is presumably benign, and no suspicious behavior such as network transmission or credential theft is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard extraction utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It is designed to parse and summarize recon data securely. No signs of malware, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
