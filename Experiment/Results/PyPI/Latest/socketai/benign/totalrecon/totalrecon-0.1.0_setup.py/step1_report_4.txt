  "purpose": "Setup script for the totalrecon Python package, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, or obfuscated segments detected; standard setuptools usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads a local README file for the long description but does not perform any network operations, code execution, or handling of untrusted data. All dependencies are standard, and no suspicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate package setup code.",
