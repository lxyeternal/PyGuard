  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'totalrecon' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "File reading of 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no external data sinks or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Reads the README file during setup; dependencies are specified but not executed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns detected. The code is straightforward setup logic.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to configure package installation, including reading a long description from a file and listing dependencies. No code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs beyond package setup. Dependencies are standard and related to machine learning and web requests. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to package and distribute the project metadata and dependencies without any malicious intent.",
