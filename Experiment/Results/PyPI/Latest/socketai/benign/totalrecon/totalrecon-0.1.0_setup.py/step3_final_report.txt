{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project using setuptools, defining metadata, dependencies, and reading README.md for description.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; dependencies listed in install_requires; static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script employing setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and reads a README file. There are no dynamic operations, network calls, or untrusted data handling. Dependencies are standard for AI and PDF processing tools. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. Multiple reports confirm its benign nature with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores at 0, and high confidence. The code's simplicity and standard practices indicate no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a legitimate, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
