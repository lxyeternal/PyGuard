{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'totalrecon', intended for passive reconnaissance and AI summarization tasks related to security and open-source tooling.",
  "sources": "Reads metadata from the setup script, including package data, README.md content, and dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "targets": "The dependencies ('transformers', 'torch', 'requests', 'PyMuPDF') are installed; README.md is read but not executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reads package description and dependencies during setup; no external data or untrusted input is processed at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code strictly adheres to standard setup script patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' functions to configure package installation. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The dependencies are standard for AI and security tooling. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious code constructs are present. All operations are typical for Python package setup, with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and legitimate.",
