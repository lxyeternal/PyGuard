  "purpose": "Load a pre-trained Hugging Face model and tokenizer to perform text summarization on recon data.",
  "sources": "Model and tokenizer loading from Hugging Face; input text provided to summarize_recon function.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network transmissions; processing occurs locally within the function.",
  "flows": "Input text -> tokenizer -> model inference -> tokenizer decode -> output summary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard NLP tasks: loading a reputable pre-trained model, validating input, tokenizing, generating summaries, and decoding. It uses common libraries (transformers, torch) without any external communication beyond model download, which is typical. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The input validation is appropriate, and the inference process is straightforward. The model source is a trusted public repository. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing a standard summarization pipeline with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is acceptable but could be lowered to 0, as no external communication or sensitive data handling occurs. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.",
