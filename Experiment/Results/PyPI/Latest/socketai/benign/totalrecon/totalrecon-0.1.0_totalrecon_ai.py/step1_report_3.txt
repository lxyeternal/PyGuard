  "purpose": "AI summarization for recon data using a fine-tuned flan-t5-small model.",
  "sources": "Loading pretrained model and tokenizer from the internet, reading input text provided to the summarize_recon function.",
  "sinks": "Model generate method potentially outputs text; no data is sent externally in this code.",
  "flows": "Input text -> tokenizer -> model -> generate -> decode -> output summary",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The code performs standard NLP summarization tasks. No use of insecure environment variables or unsafe SQL. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries from transformers, loads a pretrained model and tokenizer from Hugging Face, and defines a function to generate a summary of input text. It includes input validation and uses torch.no_grad() for inference, which are standard practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All functions are typical for NLP summarization, and no unusual code patterns or suspicious data flows are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for text summarization using a pretrained transformer model. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. It simply processes input text to produce a summary without external data leaks or harmful behavior.",
