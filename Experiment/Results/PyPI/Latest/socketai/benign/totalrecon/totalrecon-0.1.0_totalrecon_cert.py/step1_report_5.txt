  "purpose": "Fetches subdomains for a given domain from Certificate Transparency logs via crt.sh.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to https://crt.sh/?q=%25.{domain}&output=json and response.json() parsing",
  "sinks": "Processing data returned from crt.sh, printing errors to standard output",
  "flows": "Request URL construction -> HTTP request -> JSON response parsing -> Extracted subdomains returned",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors, standard usage of requests library",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a URL with the input domain, performs a GET request with a user-agent header, and processes the JSON response to extract subdomains containing the input domain. It handles exceptions by printing error messages. No suspicious code or malicious behavior is present; the function only performs data retrieval and basic processing. No hidden network communications or sensitive data access are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of fetching subdomains from crt.sh with no malicious intent. It operates within expected parameters, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The security risk is minimal.",
