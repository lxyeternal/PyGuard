  "sinks": "Processing 'name_value' entries, filtering for domain matches, and returning sorted list of subdomains.",
  "flows": "Request to crt.sh (source) -> JSON response -> parsing 'name_value' -> filtering for domain -> output list (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling that catches all exceptions, but no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a URL to query crt.sh for subdomains, performs a GET request with a user-agent header, parses the JSON response, and extracts subdomain names. It handles errors broadly, printing errors without exposing sensitive data. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The network activity is limited to a trusted, public API. The code is straightforward and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for fetching subdomains from crt.sh. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
