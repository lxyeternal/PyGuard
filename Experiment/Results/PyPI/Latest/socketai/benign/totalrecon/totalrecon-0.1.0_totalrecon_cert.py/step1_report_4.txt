  "purpose": "Fetches subdomains for a given domain from crt.sh using Certificate Transparency logs.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameter 'domain', makes HTTP GET request to crt.sh API endpoint.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs error messages to standard output, processes JSON response data.",
  "flows": "Input domain -> request URL -> response -> JSON parsing -> extraction of domain names.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or unusual code structures. Uses standard requests library. No obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a URL for querying crt.sh with the provided domain, makes an HTTP GET request with a custom User-Agent, and processes the JSON response to extract subdomains containing the input domain. Exception handling captures request failures and logs an error message. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No use of untrusted inputs beyond the domain parameter; no evident data leaks or malicious actions. The approach is straightforward and aligns with standard API consumption patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured module for querying subdomains from crt.sh without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations securely and transparently.",
