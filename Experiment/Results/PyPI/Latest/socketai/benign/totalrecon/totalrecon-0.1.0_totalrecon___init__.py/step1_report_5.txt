{
  "purpose": "Defines module exports for functions related to certificate domain retrieval, document extraction, and AI summarization.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .cert, .extract, and .ai",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data processing, output, or network activity present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only imports and exports are present",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures detected; simple import/export statements",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements and an __all__ list defining exported functions. No data input/output, no network or system calls, and no dynamic execution present. It appears to be a standard module setup for exporting functions from local modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module export setup with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
