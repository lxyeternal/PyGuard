{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define the public interface for a Python package, exporting specific functions from internal modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .cert, .extract, .ai",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed; code mainly imports and defines __all__",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely sets exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward module interface definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from local modules and defines an __all__ list to specify public API. There is no logic, data handling, or external communication. The imports suggest functionality related to certificate domain extraction, PDF and text extraction, and AI summarization. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as an interface aggregator for internal functions and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard, benign module definition for a Python package.",
