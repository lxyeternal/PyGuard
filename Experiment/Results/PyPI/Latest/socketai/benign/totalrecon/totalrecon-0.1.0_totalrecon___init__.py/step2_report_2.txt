  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content:**\n```python\nfrom .cert import get_cert_domains\nfrom .extract import extract_from_pdf, extract_from_txt, extract_from_text\nfrom .ai import summarize_recon\n\n__all__ = [\n    \"get_cert_domains\",\n    \"extract_from_pdf\",\n    \"extract_from_txt\",\n    \"extract_from_text\",\n    \"summarize_recon\"\n]\n```\n\nThis code is a typical `__init__.py` or module interface file, importing specific functions from internal modules and defining an explicit public API via `__all__`. There is no logic, data processing, or external communication.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the reports:\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** All reports agree that this code is a straightforward module interface, importing functions from internal modules and exporting them via `__all__`. They emphasize the absence of data handling, network activity, or suspicious code patterns.\n\n- **Security & Malicious Behavior:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity detected. The reasoning is consistent: the code only exports functions, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious imports.\n\n- **Obfuscation & Risks:** All reports correctly identify that the code is not obfuscated and does not contain suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1, reflecting high certainty based on the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code is exactly as described—importing functions and defining `__all__`. No issues or malicious activity are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as a benign interface module.\n\n- **Scores and justifications:**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0  \n  - `obfuscated`: 0  \n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n  These are appropriate given the code content.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions. They do not speculate about potential vulnerabilities without evidence.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain **0**.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain **0**.  \n- **Risk score:** Should remain **0**, as there's no indication of security risk.\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code, I agree with the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- The code is a standard module interface with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis is a safe, benign module setup with no security concerns.",
