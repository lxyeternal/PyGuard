{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define the public API of a module by importing specific functions from local submodules for certificate domain retrieval, PDF/text extraction, and AI summarization.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from local modules: .cert, .extract, and .ai.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no external communication, data output, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports functions and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package's __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from internal modules and defines __all__ for exports, typical for a package's initialization file. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious imports, or malicious behaviors such as network activity, data theft, or system modifications. The modules imported are likely related to certificate processing, PDF/text extraction, and AI summarization, which are common functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer for a Python package, importing specific functions and defining its public API. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this snippet.",
