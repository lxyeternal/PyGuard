  "purpose": "This code exports functions for certificate domain retrieval, PDF and text extraction, and summarization, likely for a larger processing or analysis tool.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .cert, .extract, .ai",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network or file operations are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks within this snippet; functions are only imported and exported",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected; the code is straightforward module interface definition",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from local modules and exposes them via __all__, indicating an interface for a larger application. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or network operations here. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observable in this snippet. The structure is typical for a Python module defining public API functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module interface definition with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious behavior. Overall, it appears safe.",
