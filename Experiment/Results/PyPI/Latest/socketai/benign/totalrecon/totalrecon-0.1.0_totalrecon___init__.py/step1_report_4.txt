  "purpose": "The code appears to define module exports for a package, exposing functions related to certificate domain retrieval, PDF and text extraction, and AI summarization.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from local modules: cert, extract, and ai.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident; the code only imports functions and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible within this snippet; no untrusted data handling or processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs module import statements and sets the __all__ list for exports. It does not include any data input, network operations, or processing logic. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent can be inferred from this minimal module declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup, exporting functions for use elsewhere. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
