  "purpose": "Exports the 'timer' context manager from the gadsqlalchemy library module for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing 'timer' from gadsqlalchemy.contextmanagers.time.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or user input processing present.",
  "flows": "Importing 'timer' but not using or executing it within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single 'timer' object from an external package and declares it in __all__ for export. It does not execute any functions, handle data, or include dynamic code. The import path appears legitimate for a SQLAlchemy context manager. No suspicious activity or malicious behavior is evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module exporting an imported context manager, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided code.",
