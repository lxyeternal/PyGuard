  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a 'timer' context manager and exposes it via __all__. No suspicious logic, code injection, or malicious behavior is visible. The package source 'gadsqlalchemy' could be a legitimate or malicious package, but this cannot be determined solely from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module exporting a 'timer' context manager with no apparent malicious intent. No security issues are evident within this code fragment.",
