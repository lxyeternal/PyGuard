  "purpose": "Exports the 'timer' context manager from the gadsqlalchemy library for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from gadsqlalchemy.contextmanagers.time import timer'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "N/A - code only imports and exports a symbol.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and export statement.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a 'timer' object from a specific module within a third-party library and then exposes it via '__all__'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. It does not perform any data processing, external connections, or code execution. The structure is minimal and typical for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export statement with no malicious intent or security issues. It is likely part of a larger module that provides timing functionality. No suspicious activity detected.",
