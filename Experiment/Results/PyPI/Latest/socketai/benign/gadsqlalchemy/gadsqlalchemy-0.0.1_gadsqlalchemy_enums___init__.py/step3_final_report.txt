  "purpose": "Re-export of the 'Isolation' enum from 'gadsqlalchemy.enums.engine' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'Isolation' from a submodule.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Import of 'Isolation' as a source; export via '__all__' as a sink.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal, straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import and re-export of an enum, with no data processing, dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation. No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or anomalies are present. The scores assigned in the reports, particularly the malware and obfuscated scores, are appropriate at 0. The security risk score in report 5 (0.1) is an overestimation; given the benign and static nature of the code, it should be adjusted to 0. Overall, the code is benign, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module re-export with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The security risk score in report 5 should be revised from 0.1 to 0 to accurately reflect the absence of risk.",
