  "purpose": "This code is used to expose the 'Isolation' enum from the 'gadsqlalchemy.enums.engine' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'Isolation' from another module",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or processing occurs",
  "flows": "Import source flows directly into the module's namespace and into the __all__ list",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and export declaration",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific enumeration ('Isolation') from a submodule and declares it as part of the public API via __all__. There are no inputs, data processing, or suspicious constructs. The code is minimal and typical for Python module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign module that re-exports an enum for public use. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
