{
  "purpose": "The code imports an enumeration named Isolation from a module within the gadsqlalchemy package and exposes it for external use.",
  "sources": "The import statement from gadsqlalchemy.enums.engine",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output is present",
  "flows": "No data flows, as this code only performs a static import and defines an __all__ variable",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports a specific enumeration and sets its public interface. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The imported module appears to be a standard part of the gadsqlalchemy library, which is likely an ORM-related package. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a simple module that exports an enum. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks in this snippet.",
