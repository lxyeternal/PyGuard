  "purpose": "The code exports the 'Isolation' enumeration from the 'gadsqlalchemy.enums.engine' module for use elsewhere in the application.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'Isolation' from an external module 'gadsqlalchemy.enums.engine'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs an import and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of an import statement and an export declaration. It appears to be a standard module that exposes an imported enumeration. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module that re-exports an enumeration for modularity purposes. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
