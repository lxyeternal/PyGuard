  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and any underlying assumptions.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward import and export of an enum, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The only report assigning a non-zero security risk score is report 5, citing a risk of 0.1, which appears to be an overestimation given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as a simple import/export, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No issues. The confidence is 1, which is justified.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No issues. Confidence is 1.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Accurate, emphasizes the minimal nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No issues. Confidence is 1.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Also accurate, consistent with others.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No issues. Confidence is 1.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Slightly more cautious, assigns a security risk of 0.1.\n- **Analysis:** The report states that the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, but assigns a small security risk.\n- **Score justification:** Given the code's simplicity, the security risk should be zero. The assigned 0.1 seems to be an overestimation, perhaps assuming potential for future issues or overgeneralizing from the presence of an external package.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Should be 0, not 0.1, because there's no evident vulnerability or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n- The malware scores are all appropriate (0).\n- The security risk scores are all 0, except report 5, which overstates it as 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n- **Malware Score:** I agree with 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 for all, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Should be 0 for all, including report 5, because there's no actual risk demonstrated.\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and the analysis provided. The only correction needed is in report 5's security risk score, which should be lowered from 0.1 to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities exists in this code snippet. The reports are consistent in their benign assessment, with the minor exception of the security risk score in report 5.",
