{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to define and expose the 'Isolation' enumeration from the 'gadsqlalchemy.enums.engine' module, likely for use in database transaction isolation levels.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'Isolation' from an external module 'gadsqlalchemy.enums.engine'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; the code only defines '__all__' for module exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or user data; the code merely sets an export list.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no unusual constructs or suspicious patterns. It references an external package, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific enumeration from an external library and specifies it for export. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation. It does not contain hardcoded secrets or executable code beyond the import and export definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and contains no malicious elements. It serves as a module to expose an imported enumeration for external use, with no security concerns identified.",
