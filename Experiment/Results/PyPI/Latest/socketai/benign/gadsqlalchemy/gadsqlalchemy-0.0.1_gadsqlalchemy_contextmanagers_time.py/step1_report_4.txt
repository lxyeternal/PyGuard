  "purpose": "Provides a context manager to measure elapsed time during code execution.",
  "sources": "Reads system time via time.perf_counter() at the start of the context.",
  "sinks": "Returns a lambda function that, when called, reads system time again; no external sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Source (start time) -> yield lambda function -> sink (call to lambda at later point) to measure elapsed time.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard library functions in a typical pattern for timing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager 'timer' that records the start time with time.perf_counter(). It yields a lambda function that, when invoked, calculates the elapsed time by subtracting the start from the current time. There are no external data inputs, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior. The pattern is typical for measuring execution duration. No obfuscation or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a simple timing utility using standard Python features. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
