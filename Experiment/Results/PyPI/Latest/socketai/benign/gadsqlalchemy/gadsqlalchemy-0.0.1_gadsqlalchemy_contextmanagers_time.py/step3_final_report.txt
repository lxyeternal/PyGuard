  "purpose": "A context manager that measures elapsed time during code execution by capturing start time with time.perf_counter() and providing a lambda to compute the difference.",
  "sources": "Reads start time from time.perf_counter() at context entry.",
  "sinks": "Yields a lambda function; no external data sinks or leaks.",
  "flows": "Source: start time; Sink: lambda function invoked later to get elapsed time.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple timing utility using standard Python libraries. It captures the start time upon entering the context and yields a lambda that calculates elapsed time when called. No external inputs, data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, utility pattern with high confidence. No suspicious signals or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard timing context manager with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
