{
  "purpose": "Provides a context manager to measure elapsed time during code execution.",
  "sources": "Reads the system clock using time.perf_counter() at start and during the yield.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Records start time with time.perf_counter(), then the yielded lambda function calculates elapsed time using time.perf_counter() - start.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward implementation of a timing context manager.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a timing context manager that captures the start time when entering the context and yields a lambda function to calculate elapsed time when invoked. Uses standard Python library functions with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, no data leaks, no malicious code, and no obfuscated logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for measuring elapsed time within a context and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
