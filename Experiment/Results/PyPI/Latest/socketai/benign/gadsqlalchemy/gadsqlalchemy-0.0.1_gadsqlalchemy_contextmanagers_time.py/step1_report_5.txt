{
  "purpose": "Provides a context manager to measure execution time of code blocks",
  "sources": "Reads system time via time.perf_counter() at the start of the context",
  "sinks": "Returns a lambda function that, when called, retrieves the elapsed time; no external data sinks or leaks present",
  "flows": "Starts timing at entry, upon yield returns a function that can be called later to get elapsed time",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code; simple timing utility with standard library functions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager 'timer' that captures the start time using time.perf_counter() when entering the context. It yields a lambda function that calculates the elapsed time when invoked. The implementation is straightforward, utilizing standard library modules without any obfuscated or malicious behavior. No external input, data leaks, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign timing utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code is simple, clear, and uses standard practices for measuring elapsed time.",
