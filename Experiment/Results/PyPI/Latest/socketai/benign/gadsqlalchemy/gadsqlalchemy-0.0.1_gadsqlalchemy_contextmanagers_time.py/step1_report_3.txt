{
  "purpose": "The code defines a context manager for timing code execution durations.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time via time.perf_counter() at the start of the context.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process or output external data.",
  "flows": "The start time is captured, and the lambda returned yields the elapsed time when invoked.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python modules to create a timing context manager. It records the start time with time.perf_counter(), yields a lambda function that calculates and returns the elapsed time upon invocation, which is typical for performance measurement. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign utility for measuring code execution time. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
