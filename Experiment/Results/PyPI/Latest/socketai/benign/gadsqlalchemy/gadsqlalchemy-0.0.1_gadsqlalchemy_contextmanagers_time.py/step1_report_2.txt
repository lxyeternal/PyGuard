  "purpose": "Define a context manager to measure elapsed time during code execution.",
  "sources": "time.perf_counter() is called at the start; the lambda function returns elapsed time when invoked.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only measures and reports elapsed time internally.",
  "flows": "Start time recorded by perf_counter() -> yield lambda that computes current perf_counter() minus start -> caller can invoke lambda to get elapsed time.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for timing operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a context manager that captures start time and yields a lambda function to calculate elapsed time. No external input handling, no data leakage, no suspicious behavior, and no complex or obfuscated code. The purpose is benign performance measurement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard timing utility without malicious intent or security risks.",
