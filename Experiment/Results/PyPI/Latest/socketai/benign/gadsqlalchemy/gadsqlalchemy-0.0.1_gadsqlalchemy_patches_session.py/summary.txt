  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious utility for profiling SQL queries in SQLAlchemy's AsyncSession. It logs detailed SQL statements with embedded parameters, which could expose sensitive data if logs are not properly protected. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The security risk score is around 0.2-0.3, justified by the potential data leakage through logs. Proper log handling practices are recommended to mitigate this risk."
