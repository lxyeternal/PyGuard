  "purpose": "The code aims to wrap and profile the execution time of SQL statements executed via an asynchronous SQLAlchemy session.",
  "sources": "Reads the SQL statement being executed (via 'statement' parameter) and the session's execute method.",
  "sinks": "Logs the compiled SQL query as a string, potentially exposing sensitive query data in logs.",
  "flows": "The 'execute' method is overridden with '_execute', which compiles the statement to a string and logs it before executing.",
  "anomalies": "The code converts the SQL statement into a string with 'literal_binds=True', which may include sensitive data in logs. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a profiler function that monkey-patches the session's execute method to add timing and logging. It uses context managers to measure execution time and logs the full SQL query with literal binds. This could leak sensitive data if logs are not properly secured but does not perform any malicious actions. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code is standard for profiling and logging SQL queries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a profiling utility for logging executed SQL statements along with their execution time. It does not contain malicious behavior but may leak sensitive query data through logs. No malware or security risks are evident besides potential data exposure if logs are insecure.",
