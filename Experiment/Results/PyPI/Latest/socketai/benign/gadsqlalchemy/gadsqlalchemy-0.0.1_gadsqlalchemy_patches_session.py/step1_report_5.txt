{
  "purpose": "To wrap and profile the execution time of SQL statements executed via an AsyncSession in SQLAlchemy.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'session' object and the 'statement' parameter passed to the '_execute' inner function.",
  "sinks": "The code converts 'statement' to a string and logs it; no external sinks are used for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The 'session.execute' method is replaced with '_execute', which compiles the statement to a string and logs it, measuring execution time.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The compilation of the SQL statement with 'literal_binds=True' could potentially expose sensitive data if the SQL contains secrets, but this is standard in profiling and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies an SQLAlchemy AsyncSession object by replacing its 'execute' method with an asynchronous wrapper that profiles execution time and logs the actual SQL query with bound parameters. It uses 'statement.compile' with 'literal_binds=True' to produce a full SQL string with parameters embedded, which can be useful for debugging but may expose sensitive data if such data exists in the statements. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or malicious data handling. The code is a typical profiling utility, relying on standard libraries and patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a profiling wrapper for SQLAlchemy AsyncSession's 'execute' method, primarily intended for performance monitoring. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The use of 'literal_binds=True' could be sensitive if used with untrusted data containing secrets, but this is common in profiling contexts. Overall, it appears to be a benign, purpose-specific utility.",
