  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a declarative base for SQLAlchemy ORM models and defines a type variable for ORM tables. No input processing, data manipulation, or network interactions are present. The code is straightforward and follows standard patterns for SQLAlchemy usage. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard setup for SQLAlchemy ORM models with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
