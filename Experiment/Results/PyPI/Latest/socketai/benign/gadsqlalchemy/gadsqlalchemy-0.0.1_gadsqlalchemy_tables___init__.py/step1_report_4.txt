  "purpose": "Defines a SQLAlchemy declarative base class and a type variable for ORM models.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from source to sink identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TypeVar for ORM class, but no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing and SQLAlchemy's declarative_base, then creates a base class for ORM models and a type variable bound to this base. It also defines an __all__ list for module exports. There are no input handling, external data sources, or sinks that could be exploited. No obfuscated code, no malicious logic, and no suspicious patterns detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for setting up SQLAlchemy ORM base classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for SQLAlchemy ORM models with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply prepares the environment for database model definitions.",
