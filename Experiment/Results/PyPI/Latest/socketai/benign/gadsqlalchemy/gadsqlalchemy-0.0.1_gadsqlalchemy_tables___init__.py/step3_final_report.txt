  "purpose": "Setup for SQLAlchemy ORM models with a declarative base and a type variable for ORM classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements, declaration of 'Base' via 'declarative_base()', and definition of 'Table' as a TypeVar bound to 'Base'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only defines classes and type variables.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional use of 'typing.TypeVar' bound to SQLAlchemy's 'Base', but this is a pattern for type hinting and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, standard, and intended for ORM setup. It imports necessary modules, defines a declarative base, and a type variable for ORM models. No data processing, input handling, or external data sources are present. The use of 'TypeVar' with 'Base' is somewhat unconventional but not malicious. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected. The code is clear, straightforward, and aligns with common ORM patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are justified and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup for SQLAlchemy ORM models with no security concerns or malicious intent. The current scores are accurate and justified.",
