  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy declarative base class and a type variable for ORM models.",
  "sources": "Import statements for typing and SQLAlchemy, declaration of Base using declarative_base().",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leakage or execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only sets up ORM base classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a SQLAlchemy declarative base, and creates a type variable bound to this base for type hinting. The __all__ variable specifies exported names. The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for setting up ORM models. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for SQLAlchemy ORM models with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
