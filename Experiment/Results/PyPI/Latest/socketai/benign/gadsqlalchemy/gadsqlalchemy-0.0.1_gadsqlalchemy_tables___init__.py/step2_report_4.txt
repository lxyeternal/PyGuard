  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, standard setup for SQLAlchemy ORM models.\n- No reports identify any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code is minimal, with only imports, a Base class, a type variable, and an __all__ list.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources involving untrusted data are present.\n- The usage of TypeVar with the ORM base is somewhat unconventional but not suspicious or malicious.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is consistent across reports; all confirm that it’s a benign setup.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), indicating certainty in the benign assessment.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, consistent with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk scores are 0, as the code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n\n**Potential issues or overestimations:**\n- None of the reports suggest any potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The usage of TypeVar with the ORM base is noted as unconventional but not harmful or suspicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, safe setup for SQLAlchemy ORM models.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code’s nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately. No changes are necessary.",
