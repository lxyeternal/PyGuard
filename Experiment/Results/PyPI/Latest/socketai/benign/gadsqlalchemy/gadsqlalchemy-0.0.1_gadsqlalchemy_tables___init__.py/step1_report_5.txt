  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy declarative base class and a type variable for ORM models.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; only module-level definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; code is static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of typing.TypeVar with the SQLAlchemy declarative base is unconventional but not inherently malicious; no suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing and SQLAlchemy modules, defines a declarative base 'Base' for ORM mappings, and a type variable 'Table' bound to 'Base'. It also defines __all__ for module exports. The code is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious control flow. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs are present. The usage pattern is typical for setting up ORM models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for SQLAlchemy ORM models with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is a safe, minimal configuration with no anomalous or malicious patterns.",
