  "purpose": "Define a base class for SQLAlchemy ORM models and declare a type variable for ORM tables.",
  "sources": "The import statements for 'typing' and 'declarative_base', and the assignment of 'Base' and 'Table'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data is used; the code only sets up ORM base class and type variable.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is merely setting up class definitions and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'typing' for type annotations and 'declarative_base' from SQLAlchemy to create a base ORM class. It assigns this to 'Base'. Then it defines a type variable 'Table' bound to 'Base', indicating that ORM table classes should conform to 'Base'. The __all__ list specifies the public API. There are no hidden behaviors, obfuscated elements, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for SQLAlchemy ORM models using type annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
