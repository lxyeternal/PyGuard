  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class for different database isolation levels as strings.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static enumeration definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum class definition with no dynamic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple enumeration class 'Isolation' inheriting from 'str' and 'enum.Enum', representing common database isolation levels. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The structure is clear and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an enumeration for database isolation levels with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
