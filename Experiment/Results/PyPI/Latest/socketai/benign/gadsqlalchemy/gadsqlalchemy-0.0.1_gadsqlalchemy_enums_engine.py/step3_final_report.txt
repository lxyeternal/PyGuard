  "purpose": "Defines a static enumeration of database isolation levels as string constants.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static constants only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum class with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static enumeration inheriting from str and enum.Enum, listing standard database isolation levels. It contains no dynamic behavior, external dependencies, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign, static nature. No signs of malicious activity, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0, with full confidence (1). The code poses no security risks or malicious intent, and the assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enumeration defining database isolation levels. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
