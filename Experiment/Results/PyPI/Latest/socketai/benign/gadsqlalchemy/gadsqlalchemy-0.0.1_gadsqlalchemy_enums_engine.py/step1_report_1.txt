{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class 'Isolation' representing different database isolation levels as string constants.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; only class definition with static string members.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no data processing or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static code with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Python Enum class inheriting from str, listing standard database isolation levels. There are no dynamic operations, external data reads, or potential malicious patterns. The code appears to be purely for defining constants. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign enumeration class for database isolation levels with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
