{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for isolation levels in database transactions",
  "sources": "None, as the code only declares an enum class",
  "sinks": "None, no data flows or external interactions present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code solely defines constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of an enum class named Isolation with string values representing different database transaction isolation levels. It uses standard Python enum syntax and appears to serve as a configuration or constant reference. There are no indications of malicious behavior, external data access, or obfuscation. The code does not include input/output operations, network access, or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely defines constants for database isolation levels. No malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks are present.",
