  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward Python enumeration class defining constants for database isolation levels.\n   - All reports agree that the code is static, contains no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all evidence points to benign, static code with no malicious or suspicious behavior, the `malware` score should remain at 0.\n   - The `securityRisk` score should also stay at 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is correctly at 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make any unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on static analysis.\n   - No suspicious behaviors are inferred or claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a simple, static enumeration class defining database isolation levels. All reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code. There are no issues requiring concern.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
