  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class for database isolation levels as strings.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enum class named Isolation with string values representing database transaction isolation levels. It imports the enum module, which is standard for creating enumerations. There are no functions, data input/output, or external interactions. The code appears to be a simple, static enumeration without any dynamic or obfuscated behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign enumeration definition with no malicious intent or security risks.",
