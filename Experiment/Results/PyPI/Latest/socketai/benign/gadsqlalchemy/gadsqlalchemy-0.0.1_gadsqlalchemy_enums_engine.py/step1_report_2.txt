  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for various database isolation levels as string constants.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code is a static class definition.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or operations that process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code declares an Enum class with string values representing database isolation levels. It is a straightforward implementation without dynamic code execution, input handling, or external dependencies. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent in this static code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enumeration definition for database isolation levels with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
