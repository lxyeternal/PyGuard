  "purpose": "This code imports a profiler function from a specific module within the gadsqlalchemy library and exposes it for external use.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'gadsqlalchemy.patches.session' for 'profiler'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks where untrusted data could be exploited or cause harm.",
  "flows": "The source is the import of 'profiler', which is then exported via __all__ for external use.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only importing and exporting a single function. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script's only action is to import a 'profiler' from a module within 'gadsqlalchemy.patches.session' and make it available externally via __all__. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious commands. The code's simplicity suggests it's intended to provide profiling capabilities for database sessions. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily acting as a module that re-exports the 'profiler' function. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet.",
