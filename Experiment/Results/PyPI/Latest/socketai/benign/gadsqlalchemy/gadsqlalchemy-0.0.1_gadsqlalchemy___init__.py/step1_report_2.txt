{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define an interface or module exports for a package involving SQLAlchemy setup, enums, and table definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'gadsqlalchemy' package modules: enums, setup, tables, and specific objects like Base and Table.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is primarily import/export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from an external 'gadsqlalchemy' package and re-exports some of these objects via __all__. It contains no dynamic execution, user input handling, or network activity. The package seems to be a structured ORM setup for SQLAlchemy models, enums, and configurations. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code is static, clean, and standard for a module export in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as an interface or module declaration for a SQLAlchemy-related package. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
