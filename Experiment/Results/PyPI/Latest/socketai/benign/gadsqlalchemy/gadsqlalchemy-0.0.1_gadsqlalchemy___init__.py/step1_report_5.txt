{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes and enums from the gadsqlalchemy package and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "Import statements from gadsqlalchemy modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs; the code only imports and exports modules",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an export list definition. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code patterns. The imported modules could be part of a larger application, but based on this fragment alone, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import and export setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
