{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and enums from the gadsqlalchemy package and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "The import statements are sources where the code reads external modules and their components.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The code imports components from the gadsqlalchemy package, establishing dependencies but not executing any untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscated code are present. The code simply imports modules and defines an export list.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from the gadsqlalchemy package, which appears to be a SQLAlchemy-based ORM utility. It only defines what will be exported and does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execution of dynamic code. There are no hardcoded secrets, no code injection, and no malicious behavior detectable. The code is straightforward and typical for module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely imports and exposes certain components from a package.",
