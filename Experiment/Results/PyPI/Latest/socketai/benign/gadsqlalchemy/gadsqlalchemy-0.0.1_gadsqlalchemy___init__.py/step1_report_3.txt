  "purpose": "The code imports specific components from the 'gadsqlalchemy' package and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'gadsqlalchemy.enums', 'gadsqlalchemy.setup', and 'gadsqlalchemy.tables'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; code only imports modules and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths; only static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific components from an external package and defines an export list. No dynamic code execution, no user input handling, and no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It appears to be a standard module initialization or interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and appears to serve as a public interface for a larger package. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
