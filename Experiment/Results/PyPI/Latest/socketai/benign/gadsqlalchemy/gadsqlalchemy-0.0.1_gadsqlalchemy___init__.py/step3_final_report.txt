{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and enums from the gadsqlalchemy package and defines an __all__ list for module exports.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from gadsqlalchemy modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static import and export only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements and a definition of __all__, with no dynamic execution, data processing, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is a typical module setup for re-exporting components. Given the simplicity and static nature, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No improvements or changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
