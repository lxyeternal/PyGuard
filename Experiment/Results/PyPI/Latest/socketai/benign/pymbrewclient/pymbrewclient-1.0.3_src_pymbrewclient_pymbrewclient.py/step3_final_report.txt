{
  "purpose": "A client for interacting with the Minibrew Pro Portal API, providing methods to obtain tokens, brewery overviews, and session info.",
  "sources": "User credentials (username, password), base_url parameter, internal call to _get_token() method",
  "sinks": "Return of token and session data, API calls to external server",
  "flows": "Credentials provided during initialization → internal call to _get_token() → data fetched from API endpoints",
  "anomalies": "Use of a protected method _get_token(), but this is a common internal pattern and not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client wrapper with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. It relies on an external RestApiClient, which is not provided but assumed to be standard. The use of _get_token() is an internal detail, not indicative of malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code handles credentials at runtime, which is typical, and no vulnerabilities are apparent within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign API client with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
