  "purpose": "This code contains only licensing and legal notices embedded as comments, with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "The comments themselves serve as the source, providing license and attribution information.",
  "sinks": "There are no data inputs or outputs; no untrusted data flows or external data handling occur.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code is purely static comments without runtime or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the content is standard legal/license text.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static block of comments containing licensing and disclaimer notices. No executable code, data flows, or network activity are present. The content is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign licensing and legal notices embedded as comments. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concern. The current scores and analysis are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
