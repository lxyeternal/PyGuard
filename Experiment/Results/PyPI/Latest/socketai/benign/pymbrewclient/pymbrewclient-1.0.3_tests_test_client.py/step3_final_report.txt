{
  "purpose": "The code is a suite of unit tests for the RestApiClient class in the pymbrewclient package, validating token management, data retrieval, and error handling through mocked API responses.",
  "sources": "Requests to requests.post, requests.get, and time.time functions, as well as internal methods like _get_token and _ensure_token.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; all data is mocked and confined within the test environment.",
  "flows": "Input data (mocked responses) flows through methods like _get_token, get_brewery_overview, get_session_info, and get, with no external data or secrets involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard testing practices with extensive mocking, ensuring no real network or data leaks. It validates functionality and error handling without executing malicious payloads or obfuscated code. All responses are mocked, and no sensitive data is processed outside the test scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured unit test suite with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0 are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
