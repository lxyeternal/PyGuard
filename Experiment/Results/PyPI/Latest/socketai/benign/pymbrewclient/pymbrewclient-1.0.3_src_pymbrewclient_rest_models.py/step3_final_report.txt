  "purpose": "Defines data models for devices, brewery overview, beer, device details, sessions, and API responses in a brewing system.",
  "sources": "Dictionary unpacking during object initialization (e.g., in Session constructor).",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; data is stored in class instances only.",
  "flows": "Dictionary data flows into class instances via unpacking; no further data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected. Use of modern syntax is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions modeling entities in a brewing system. The Session class constructor converts dictionaries into objects via dictionary unpacking, which is typical for deserialization. No functions process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The code is straightforward, readable, and uses standard Python features. The absence of external I/O, secrets, or dynamic code execution indicates minimal security risk. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the low inherent risk of data models. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard data models with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
