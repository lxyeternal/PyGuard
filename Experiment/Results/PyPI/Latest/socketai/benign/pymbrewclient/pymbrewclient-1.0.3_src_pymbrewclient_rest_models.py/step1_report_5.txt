  "purpose": "Define data structures for managing brewery devices, sessions, beers, and API responses in a brewing management application.",
  "sources": "None. The code solely contains class and data structure definitions; no input reading or external data handling is present.",
  "sinks": "None. No data processing, output, or untrusted data handling occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "None. As there are only data class definitions, no data flow from source to sink is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses modern Python features such as type hints with union operators (e.g., str | None), but this is standard and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely composed of data class definitions representing entities like Device, BreweryOverview, Beer, DeviceDetails, Session, TokenResponse, and ApiResponse. It uses typical Python dataclass syntax and standard type annotations. There are no functions performing I/O, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are detected. The code appears to be a standard data model setup for a brewing system.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward definition of data classes used for a brewing management system. It contains no input handling, output, or data processing logic, and no suspicious or malicious code components are present. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
