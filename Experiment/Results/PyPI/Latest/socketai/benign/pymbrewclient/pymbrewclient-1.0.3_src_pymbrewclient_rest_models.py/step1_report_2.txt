{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for managing brewery devices, sessions, beers, and API responses within a brewing application.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading mechanisms present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily data class definitions and object initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code consists solely of class definitions and data modeling with no runtime or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple data classes using @dataclass, representing entities such as Device, BreweryOverview, Beer, DeviceDetails, Session, TokenResponse, and ApiResponse. The Session class includes data validation via constructor, but no external input processing, insecure code, or malicious logic. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices are evident. The code is straightforward and primarily serves as data models.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard data modeling module with no malicious intent, no obfuscated or suspicious code, and no security risks identified. It appears to be safe and purely for internal data handling.",
