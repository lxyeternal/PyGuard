  "purpose": "Define data structures for managing brewery devices, sessions, beers, and API responses in a brewing application.",
  "sources": "None; the code solely contains class and data structure definitions with no input reading or external data fetching.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no functions or methods that process untrusted input directly or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there are no data processing or input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code strictly defines data models with no dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of Python data classes and a class with an initializer and a __repr__ method. It models entities such as Device, BreweryOverview, Beer, DeviceDetails, Session, TokenResponse, and ApiResponse, with no functions that perform input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. All class attributes are standard types, and no sensitive information or secrets are embedded in the code. The code appears to be a straightforward data schema for a brewing application.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of data model definitions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
