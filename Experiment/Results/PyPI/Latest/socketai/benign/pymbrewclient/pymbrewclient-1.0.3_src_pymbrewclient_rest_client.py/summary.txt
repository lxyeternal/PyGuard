  "conclusion": "The primary security issue is the hardcoded authorization token, which could be exploited if leaked. The code does not contain malware or obfuscation. The risk score of 0.6 is appropriate, reflecting the security vulnerability. Best practice would be to remove the static token and implement secure, dynamic credential management."
