  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the consistency of the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports identify the same core anomaly: a hardcoded authorization token ('TOKEN 4c433da015985d17669c604a5a4e2c906083e815') embedded in the `_get_token()` method.\n- The code appears to be a standard API client with token management, request handling, and data parsing.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection is detected.\n- The main security concern is the static token, which could be misused if exposed.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of hardcoded authorization token:** This is consistently reported and is a valid concern. It is suspicious and could be exploited if the code is leaked or shared.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The use of a hardcoded token in `_get_token()` is an **anti-pattern** and a security flaw, but not necessarily malicious code.\n- No other errors, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`. Correct, as the code is clear and readable.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.4 to 0.6. Given the presence of a hardcoded token, which is a security vulnerability, these scores seem reasonable. They reflect a moderate security concern but not an active malware threat.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- The hardcoded token could be exploited if exposed, leading to unauthorized API access. While not malware, this is a security vulnerability that warrants a higher risk score (around 0.6).\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports, all recognizing the security concern but not indicating active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the security concern due to the hardcoded token, I would assign a **risk score of 0.7**. This reflects a significant security vulnerability, especially if the token is active or could be leaked.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The core issue is the static, hardcoded authorization token.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n- The security risk is moderate to high due to potential misuse of the static token.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code should be modified to remove the hardcoded token, replacing it with a secure, dynamic credential management approach.\n\n---\n\n**Work out complete, step-by-step, and reasoned.**",
