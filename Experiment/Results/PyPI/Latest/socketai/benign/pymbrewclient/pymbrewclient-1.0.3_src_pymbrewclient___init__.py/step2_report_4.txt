  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as purely legal/license comments with no executable logic.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the content.\n\n**Specific Analysis:**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirms that the code is only license text with no executable content.  \n- The security risk is correctly scored as 0.  \n- Malware score is 0, as there's no malicious activity.  \n- Confidence is high (1).  \n- No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Same reasoning applies.  \n- No executable code or malicious content.  \n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Also purely license text, no suspicious activity.  \n- Scores are consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- License and legal notices only.  \n- No security concern.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same conclusion.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that this code block is non-executable, contains only license/legal notices, and poses no security risk.\n- The malware score is appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The risk score is correctly zero, as there's no potential for malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score is zero, given the straightforward comment nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is benign, purely legal/license text.\n- The assigned scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. The code poses no security threat.",
