  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports identify that the code is purely license and legal notices, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity.\n- The scores assigned are consistently zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which aligns with the nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), which is appropriate given the static, non-executable nature of the content.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Report 1-6:**\n- Confirmed: The code is only license comments; no executable code, data flows, or suspicious constructs.\n- Errors/Flaws: None identified; the reasoning is sound.\n- Scores: All zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk, which is reasonable.\n- Justification for scores: Since there is no code execution, no data handling, and no obfuscation, the scores are appropriate.\n- Potential vulnerabilities: None; claims are accurate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are thorough and accurate. They correctly interpret the license text as benign.\n- No changes needed to the scores or reasoning.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code present)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the static license comments, the code poses no security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate, and I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
