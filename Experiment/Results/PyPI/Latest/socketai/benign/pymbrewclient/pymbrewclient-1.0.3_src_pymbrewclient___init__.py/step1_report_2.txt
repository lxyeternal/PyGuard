  "purpose": "License and legal notice documentation for the 'pymbrewclient' Python package, including licensing terms, permissions, and disclaimers.",
  "sources": "The license and disclaimer comments at the beginning of the code, which are static text blocks.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing present; the code is purely documentation and license information.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths, as the code contains only comments and license text without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive license and legal text in comments, which is typical for license headers, not suspicious or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments that describe licensing terms, permissions, disclaimers, and copyright information. There are no executable statements, data processing, or any form of input/output handling. Since it is purely textual license information, there are no typical source-to-sink data flows or anomalies indicating malicious intent. No suspicious behavior or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a license header with legal notices and contains no executable code or malicious behavior. It poses no security risk.",
