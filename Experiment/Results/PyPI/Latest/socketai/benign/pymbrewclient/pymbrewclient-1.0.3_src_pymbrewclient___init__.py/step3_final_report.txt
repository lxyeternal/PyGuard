  "purpose": "Legal and license notices embedded as comments in the source code.",
  "sources": "Comment blocks containing license, copyright, and legal disclaimers.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow; static comments only.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static comment blocks with licensing and legal notices. There are no executable statements, data processing, network activity, or embedded code that could pose security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the content. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the content is straightforward and static. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is purely legal/license comments with no executable logic or malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the code poses no security threat.",
