  "purpose": "A hyperparameter tuner using a nature-inspired optimization algorithm for sklearn-like models.",
  "sources": "Reads model class, parameter bounds, data (X, y), and random seed.",
  "sinks": "Creates model instances with chosen parameters; evaluates models via cross-validation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> generate solutions -> evaluate models -> update solutions -> output best parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Uses random number generation for solution creation and population updates; no unusual code patterns or obfuscation; no hardcoded secrets; no suspicious external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a hyperparameter optimization routine based on a population-based method. It clones models, performs cross-validation, and updates candidate solutions iteratively. It uses numpy's random seed for reproducibility and numpy's uniform distribution for solution initialization and update steps. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of an optimization algorithm for hyperparameter tuning. No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard hyperparameter tuner for sklearn-like models, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It functions as intended for hyperparameter optimization without any suspicious features.",
