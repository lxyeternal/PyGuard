{
  "purpose": "A hyperparameter tuner that uses a nature-inspired optimization algorithm to find optimal parameters for sklearn-like models.",
  "sources": "Reads input data (X, y) during cross-validation scoring and parameter initialization.",
  "sinks": "Returns best parameters; uses cross-validation scores for evaluation; no evident data leaks or external untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, y) -> model evaluation via cross_val_score -> determination of best parameters -> return best parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors. Uses standard libraries and practices. No obfuscated or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for hyperparameter optimization, utilizing numpy and sklearn for model evaluation. It performs iterative population-based search, updating solutions towards the best candidate. No network operations, no data exfiltration, no code injection, and no malicious behavior are evident. The logic appears consistent with an intended hyperparameter tuning approach. No anomalous or suspicious code segments are present. The data flow and method implementations are standard and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a benign, standard hyperparameter tuning algorithm with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It uses common libraries and approaches, and there are no suspicious data sinks or external connections.",
