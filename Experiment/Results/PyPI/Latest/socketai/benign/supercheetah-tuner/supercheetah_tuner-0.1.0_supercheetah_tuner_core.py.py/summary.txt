  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured hyperparameter tuner with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects the inherent randomness but does not indicate any threat."
