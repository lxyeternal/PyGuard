  "purpose": "A population-based hyperparameter tuner using a nature-inspired algorithm to optimize model parameters via cross-validation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data (X, y), model class, and parameter bounds; generates random solutions and evaluates models with cross-validation.",
  "sinks": "Returns best parameters; no external data transmission or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "Randomly generates solutions -> evaluates models via cross-validation -> updates best solution -> iterates until stopping criteria -> outputs best parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a stochastic hyperparameter optimization algorithm. It clones models, evaluates via cross-validation, updates solutions towards the best, and stops early if no improvement. Uses common libraries (numpy, sklearn). No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication is present. Random seed ensures reproducibility. The logic and structure are straightforward and align with legitimate optimization routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured hyperparameter tuner with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects the inherent randomness but does not indicate any threat.",
