  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n- It uses `setuptools` to define package metadata, dependencies, and description.\n- It reads `README.md` for the `long_description`.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted user input.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior.\n- The data flow is limited to reading a local file (`README.md`) into a variable, which is a common and safe practice.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The use of `open(\"README.md\").read()` without explicit error handling could cause the setup to fail if the file is missing or inaccessible. However, this is a common pattern in setup scripts and not inherently malicious or risky.\n- No other flaws are apparent.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n- The confidence score of 1 is appropriate, as all reports agree on the benign nature.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- No report suggests any assumptions about malicious intent.\n- The only potential concern is the lack of error handling when reading `README.md`, but this does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a typical, safe setup script with no security issues.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis package configuration is benign and poses no security threat.",
