{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'supercheetah_tuner', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'README.md' to populate 'long_description'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing is present.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' (source) flows into 'long_description' parameter in setup().",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'open' to read a file without error handling or validation, which is common but not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging. It imports 'setuptools', defines package metadata, dependencies, and reads the README file for the long description. There are no external network calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic. The use of 'open' for reading a local file is typical and does not pose security risks. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It performs standard package configuration with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
