{
  "purpose": "Configure and package the 'supercheetah_tuner' Python project for distribution, specifying dependencies, metadata, and package information.",
  "sources": "Import statement for setuptools; setup() function parameters including package info, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; the code primarily reads a file (README.md) during setup.",
  "flows": "Read from 'README.md' -> included in long_description; no data flows to insecure or malicious endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The setup script appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools. It invokes setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and description info. The long_description reads from 'README.md', which is common practice. No user input handling, network connections, or executable code present. The code follows typical packaging conventions without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
