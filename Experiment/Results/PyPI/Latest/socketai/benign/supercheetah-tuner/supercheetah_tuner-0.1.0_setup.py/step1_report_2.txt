{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'supercheetah_tuner' for distribution, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Code reads the 'README.md' file for long_description, and gathers package info and dependencies from the setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; standard setup configuration does not process untrusted data at runtime.",
  "flows": "The only potential data flow involves reading 'README.md' content into 'long_description', which is safe if the file is trusted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Use of open() for 'README.md' is typical and safe in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools for packaging. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and other setup options. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or untrusted data handling. The only I/O operation is reading a markdown file for the package description, which is standard practice. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is well-formed, and all operations are standard for package distribution.",
