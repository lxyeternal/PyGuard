{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and reading a README file for description.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for 'long_description'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Source: reading 'README.md' file; sink: assigning content to 'long_description' parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with standard practices; no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. It reads a local README file to set the long description, which is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only potential issue is the lack of error handling when opening 'README.md', but this does not impact security. All signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious or security concerns. The analysis confirms no suspicious activity or vulnerabilities. The scores are correctly assigned as malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, with high confidence.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
