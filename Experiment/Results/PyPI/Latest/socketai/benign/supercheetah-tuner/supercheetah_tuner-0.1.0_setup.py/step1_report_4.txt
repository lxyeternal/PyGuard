  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup process for the 'supercheetah_tuner' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing data through setuptools functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations are present.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content during setup, which is a static file read, with no untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution or external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and other configurations. All operations are typical and safe, including reading a local README.md file and defining package requirements and classifiers. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network communication, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The script is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is benign and contains no malicious behavior. It serves to prepare the package for distribution with no security risks identified.",
