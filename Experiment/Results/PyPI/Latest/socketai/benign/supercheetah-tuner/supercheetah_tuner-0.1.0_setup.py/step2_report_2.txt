  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified across the reports.\n- The only operation involves reading 'README.md' for the long_description, which is a common and safe practice.\n- No external code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data is present.\n- The code is not obfuscated, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected.\n\n**Issue Presence:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious or security-compromising elements.\n- The reported issues are all consistent: the code is benign.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The only minor point is that the `open(\"README.md\").read()` lacks error handling, but this is typical in setup scripts and not a security concern.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence scores are 1, which is reasonable.\n\n**Potential Risks and Malware:**\n- Since no malicious activity is detected, the malware score remains at 0.\n- The risk score is also 0, aligning with the assessment that there's no security threat.\n\n**Challenging Assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that reading 'README.md' and standard setup practices are safe, which is correct.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all observations are factual.\n\n**Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: all zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on review:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, well-formed setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent with the actual code.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nNo changes needed. The code is safe and appropriate for distribution.",
