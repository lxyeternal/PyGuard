  "purpose": "Module initialization and export of the SuperCheetahTuner class",
  "sources": "Import from local module (.core), version string assignment, __all__ declaration",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external communication, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Import source to class usage (if any), but none are present in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and variable assignments, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a local import, a version string, and an __all__ declaration. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no external data flows, and no suspicious behaviors are evident. The import from a relative module is standard for package __init__.py files. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard boilerplate for module setup, with no malicious or security issues detected. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
