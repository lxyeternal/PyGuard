  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module initializer that imports a class from a local module, sets version info, and defines `__all__`.\n- No suspicious patterns, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are identified.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 and malware/security risk scores of 0, indicating they see no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present\n- The code is minimal and standard; no issues are detected in any report.\n\n### Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning\n- The reasoning is consistent across reports; no flaws are evident.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign boilerplate.\n\n### Step 3: Review scores\n- All reports assign:\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- No evidence suggests any risk or malware, so higher scores are unjustified.\n\n### Step 5: Malware score considerations\n- Since the code does not perform any dynamic or malicious actions, malware score remains 0.\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions\n- The reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis, which is reasonable here.\n- No assumptions about hidden behaviors are warranted given the code.\n\n### Step 7: Consistency of scores\n- The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard module import and export pattern with no suspicious or malicious behavior. All indicators point to a benign, boilerplate initialization file.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, with no security issues or malware present. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
