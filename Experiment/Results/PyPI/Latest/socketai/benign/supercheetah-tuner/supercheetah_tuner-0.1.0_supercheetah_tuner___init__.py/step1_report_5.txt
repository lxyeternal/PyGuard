  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static assignments and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement, version declaration, and an export list. It appears to be a typical package initializer. No external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no hidden behaviors are present. The import is from a local module, which is standard practice. The version string is static. Overall, the code is straightforward with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign module initializer with no malicious or security risks detected.",
