  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is straightforward, consisting of import statements, version assignment, and `__all__` declaration. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The code is typical for a package's `__init__.py` or module setup file.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \nNo logical errors or flaws are identified in any report. The code's simplicity reduces the likelihood of mistakes or vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Issues:**  \n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- Confidence is 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \nSince all reports unanimously indicate no malicious activity, no reason exists to assign higher risk scores. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \nAll reports base their conclusions on static code analysis, which is reasonable given the simplicity. No assumptions about hidden behaviors are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**  \nScores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious code detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Expert Judgment:\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the consistent findings across all reports, I agree with the current scores. The code appears to be standard module boilerplate with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**However,** considering the possibility of malicious code hidden elsewhere (e.g., in the `core` module), the analysis should be cautious. But based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence to suggest any threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                      |\n| Security Risk    | 0                      |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current report scores are appropriate and justified.",
