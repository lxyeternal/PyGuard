  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is extremely minimal, consisting solely of an import statement, a version string, and an __all__ declaration.\n- All reports agree that there are no suspicious patterns, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The import is from a local module (.core), which is standard practice.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or external communications are involved.\n- The purpose appears to be module initialization and export, with no logic that could introduce security issues.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned for malware (0) and obfuscated (0) are consistent with the code content.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Assessment of the scores:**\n- The \"malware\" score of 0 is justified; there's no malicious behavior.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score of 0 is appropriate; the code is straightforward.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score of 0 is correct; no vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Potential issues or misjudgments:**\n- None. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is standard module boilerplate with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n- The assigned scores are reasonable and should not be adjusted.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware score: **0** (no malicious activity)\n- Obfuscated score: **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- Risk score: **0** (no security issues)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code snippet is safe and typical for Python package initialization. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
