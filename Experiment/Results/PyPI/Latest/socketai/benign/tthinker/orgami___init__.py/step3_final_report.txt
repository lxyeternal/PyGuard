{
  "purpose": "The code performs a relative import of 'codes' from the 'main' module, likely as part of a package's internal structure.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply imports a module component.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import with no embedded logic, data leaks, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with scores reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. Confidence in benignity is high (1), and the minimal context supports a malware score of 0. The slight security risk score (~0.1) in some reports accounts for potential downstream misuse but is justified given the limited scope. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident, and the code's simplicity aligns with a safe, standard pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the minimal import statement. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
