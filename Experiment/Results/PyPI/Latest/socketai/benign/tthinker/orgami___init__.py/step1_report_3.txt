  "purpose": "Import the 'codes' object or function from the 'main' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement at the start of the module, which reads the 'main' module.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of 'codes' elsewhere in the project; this line itself does not perform data sinks.",
  "flows": "Import statement may facilitate access to 'codes' for further processing, but no explicit data flow in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in this single import statement; it is a standard Python import syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports 'codes' from a relative module 'main'. This is a straightforward import statement with no embedded malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no unusual code constructs. There are no suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution or obfuscated code. Since this is a minimal fragment, it cannot be conclusively malicious, but based solely on this line, there are no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a standard Python module import, and no malicious activity can be inferred from this code alone.",
