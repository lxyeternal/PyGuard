  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the provided details.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .main import codes\n```\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code performs a **simple relative import** of `codes` from a module named `main`.\n- No additional logic, data processing, or external communication is present.\n- The import syntax is standard Python, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs.\n- The code is minimal and appears to be part of a larger package structure.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Reports 1, 2, 4, 5:\n- All describe the import as benign, straightforward, with no anomalies.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 0.8), which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 (or very close to zero).\n\n**Assessment:** These reports are consistent and accurate. The import is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3:\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a security risk score of 0.1.\n- The reasoning suggests that while the import is benign, there is a minor concern about potential misuse or future context.\n- **Potential issue:** The report hints at the possibility that `codes` could be used maliciously later, but the snippet alone doesn't support this.\n\n**Justification for scores:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious behavior shown).\n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation).\n- Security risk: 0.1 is acceptable given the minimal context, but perhaps slightly high; the code itself isn't risky.\n\n---\n\n### Critical analysis:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and the import is standard. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident in the snippet.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  No. The reasoning is sound and consistent across reports.\n\n- **Scores suggestion:**  \n  Since there's no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk, the scores should remain at zero or near-zero.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The malware score should be 0 because the code performs no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  0, as the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Should be 0, given the lack of any security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify that this code snippet is benign and standard. The scores should reflect zero risk, malware, or obfuscation. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Confirm the scores are all zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.  \n- Maintain high confidence in the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Work completed.**",
