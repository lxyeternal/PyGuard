  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is a simple relative import: `from .main import codes`.\n- The report correctly states that this is benign, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The confidence is high (1), and all scores (obfuscated, malware, securityRisk) are 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above, a straightforward import.\n- The report again correctly concludes no malicious activity.\n- Confidence is 1; scores are all 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar import statement, with slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk score (0.1).\n- The report emphasizes that this is a standard import with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The minor security risk score might reflect the possibility that, in a different context, such an import could be misused, but based solely on this line, it's benign.\n- **Justification for scores:** Since the import is standard and there's no evidence of malicious intent, the low securityRisk score is reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same import statement, with confidence 1 and no malware or obfuscation.\n- The report correctly identifies this as a standard, benign import.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, a simple import, with slightly lower confidence (0.8).\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk mostly 0 or very low) are consistent with the minimal code snippet.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- Since the code is only an import statement, there's no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The minimal code snippet cannot hide malicious intent unless the imported module itself is malicious, but that is outside the scope of this import line.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk based on this code snippet)\n\n**In conclusion,** I agree with the assessments provided. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.",
