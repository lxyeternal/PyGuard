  "purpose": "Import the 'codes' object or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module file 'main' to import 'codes'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output functions present that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'codes' from 'main' to any subsequent usage (not shown here).",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; it appears as a simple import statement with no apparent anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement in Python, importing 'codes' from a relative module 'main'. There is no evidence of code execution, data handling, or obfuscated behavior. No suspicious or malicious behavior can be inferred from this single line alone. The simplicity suggests a standard import, assuming the 'main' module exists and is legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this minimal code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The import appears normal, with no anomalies or malicious intent evident.",
