  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is a simple import statement: `from .main import codes`.\n- The report correctly identifies that there are no suspicious patterns, no anomalies, and no malicious behavior.\n- The confidence is high (1), and all scores are appropriately zero.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, it notes a straightforward import.\n- The confidence is again high (1), and scores are zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) but still indicates a benign import.\n- The report mentions a small security risk (0.1), perhaps due to the potential for the imported object to be used maliciously downstream.\n- However, based solely on this import line, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The malware score remains at 0.\n- **Potential issue:** The report assigns a minor security risk, which seems reasonable given that imported objects could be misused later, but no actual malicious activity is evident here.\n- **Recommendation:** The security risk score of 0.1 is acceptable, but it should be clarified that the risk is minimal and depends on downstream usage.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous reports, with high confidence (1) and no anomalies.\n- The conclusion is appropriate.\n- **No changes needed.**\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.8), but still concludes benign behavior.\n- All scores are zero, indicating no suspicion.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The security risk scores are minimal, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code snippet is a straightforward relative import: `from .main import codes`.\n- It is benign, with no malicious activity or security concerns evident from this line.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal potential risk due to downstream usage, but not from this line alone)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and thorough. The scores are appropriate given the minimal code and lack of suspicious activity. No modifications are necessary.",
