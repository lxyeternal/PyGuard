  "purpose": "Import the 'codes' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a symbol from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present as there is no data processing or output in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible due to minimal code; the import itself is benign.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a simple import statement from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no data leakage, no external communication, or malicious code. The import is standard Python syntax for modular code organization. Without additional context, the code appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard import statement with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
