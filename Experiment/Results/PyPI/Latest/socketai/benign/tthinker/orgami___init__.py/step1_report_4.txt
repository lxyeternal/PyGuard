  "purpose": "Imports 'codes' from the local 'main' module, likely for internal use within a package or application.",
  "sources": "The import statement sourcing 'codes' from the local 'main' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing 'codes' for subsequent use within the package; no data flows or external communications are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with a simple relative import; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement importing 'codes' from a sibling module named 'main'. There are no additional operations, no data manipulation, and no external communications. As such, it appears to be a standard part of a package structure. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior are observable in this fragment. Given its simplicity, the risk of malicious intent or security issues based solely on this snippet is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic import statement for internal module usage and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a Python package structure.",
