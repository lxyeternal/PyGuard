{
  "purpose": "The code comprises multiple scripts for data visualization, analysis, NLP, graph/tree manipulation, clustering, and GUI interactions, primarily reading CSV files and user inputs for processing and display.",
  "sources": "File reads from 'Housing.csv', 'Customers (1).csv', 'shop.csv'; user input via dialogs; data variables within scripts.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects; uses visualization libraries and file I/O, but no network or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Data is read from CSV files into pandas DataFrames, processed or visualized, with some functions (notably in Expno6) using eval() to parse data structures from files, which can execute arbitrary code if input is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() to load data structures from external files in Expno6, which is unsafe and can lead to code execution if the file content is malicious; no other suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The scripts are primarily for data visualization and analysis, with straightforward code and no signs of obfuscation or malware. The main security concern is the use of eval() in load_tree_from_file(), which can execute arbitrary code if the input file is maliciously crafted. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as no malicious intent is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.3), reflecting the potential danger of eval() usage. Replacing eval() with safer parsing methods (e.g., json.loads() or ast.literal_eval()) is recommended to mitigate this risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is mainly benign with a significant security concern due to unsafe eval() usage in data loading functions. No malware or malicious activity is detected. The overall security risk is low but should be addressed by replacing eval() with safer alternatives to prevent potential code execution vulnerabilities.",
