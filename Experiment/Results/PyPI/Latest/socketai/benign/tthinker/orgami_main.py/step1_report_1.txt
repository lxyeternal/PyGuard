{
  "purpose": "The code contains multiple independent scripts for data visualization, analysis, and graph manipulation, including file operations, text processing, and clustering.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files ('Housing.csv', 'Customers (1).csv', 'shop.csv'), user inputs via GUI dialogs, and external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable functions include file reading (eval), user input handling, and data display. Graph and visualization generation do not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Data is read from CSVs and user inputs, processed through visualization and analysis functions. No external data is transmitted or executed remotely.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() for loading tree data from file presents security risk. No other suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or code injections are detected. No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data visualization, file I/O, and user interactions. The only notable concern is the use of eval() to parse data read from a file, which can execute arbitrary code if the file contents are maliciously crafted. All other operations rely on standard libraries and user inputs, with no evidence of malware behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for data analysis and visualization tasks, with a significant security concern arising from the use of eval() on external file data, which could be exploited to execute malicious code. Otherwise, there are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The overall security risk is low, aside from the eval() usage.",
