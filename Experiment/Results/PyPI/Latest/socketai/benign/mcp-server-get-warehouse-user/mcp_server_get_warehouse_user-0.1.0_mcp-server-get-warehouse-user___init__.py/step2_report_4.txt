  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same import statement: `from .server import mcp_server_get_warehouse_user`.\n- The import is from a local module, which is standard practice.\n- None of the reports identify any suspicious behavior, anomalies, or malicious intent directly associated with this line.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.8–1.0), but given the simplicity of the code, this is appropriate.\n- Malware scores are all zero, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0 to 0.2), consistent with benign import statements.\n\n**Key points:**\n- The code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no data processing, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The function name suggests it retrieves warehouse user data, which could be legitimate.\n- Without additional context or usage, there's no evidence to suggest malicious intent.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and no anomalies are found, there is no basis to challenge the scores.\n- The only slight concern is the security risk score of 0.2 in report 4, but this could be justified if the imported function interacts with external systems or handles sensitive data in the larger codebase. However, based solely on this import line, that risk is minimal.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The import statement is benign.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks in this isolated snippet.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- I agree with the provided scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk mostly low.\n- The risk score could remain at 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just a benign import statement)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code snippet appears safe and standard. No adjustments to the scores are necessary based on the provided information.",
