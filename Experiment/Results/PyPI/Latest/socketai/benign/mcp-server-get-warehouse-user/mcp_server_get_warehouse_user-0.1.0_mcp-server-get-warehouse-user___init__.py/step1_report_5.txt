  "purpose": "Import the function 'mcp_server_get_warehouse_user' from the local server module, likely used for retrieving warehouse user data from a server component.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which loads a specific function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks or data outputs in this snippet; it is solely an import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable here; the code only imports a function, so no untrusted data flow can be assessed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "This snippet is a straightforward import statement importing a function from a relative module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The function name suggests it retrieves warehouse user data, which could be legitimate. Without additional context or code execution, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns. It appears to be a normal part of a larger codebase, and no malicious behavior can be inferred from this fragment.",
