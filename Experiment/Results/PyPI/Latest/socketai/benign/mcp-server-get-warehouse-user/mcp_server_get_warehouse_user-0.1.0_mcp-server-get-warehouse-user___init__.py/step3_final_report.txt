{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'mcp_server_get_warehouse_user' from a local server module, likely to retrieve user data related to a warehouse system.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.server), which may be invoked elsewhere in the codebase.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of the imported function could lead to data retrieval or external system interaction, but no direct sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import from the local module; actual data flow depends on subsequent code calling the function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in this import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import of a function from a local module, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. Given the lack of context, no malicious activity can be inferred. The function name suggests data retrieval, which appears legitimate. The absence of code execution, data handling, or network activity in this snippet supports a benign assessment. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This import statement is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
