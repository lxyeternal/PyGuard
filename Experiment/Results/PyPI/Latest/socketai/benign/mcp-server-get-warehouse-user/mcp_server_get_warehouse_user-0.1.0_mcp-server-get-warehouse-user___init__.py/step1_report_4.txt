{
  "purpose": "The code imports a specific function 'mcp_server_get_warehouse_user' from a local module named 'server'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the 'server' module, which may contain functions or variables that handle data or perform operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are any subsequent use of the imported function or data it retrieves, especially if it interacts with untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported function 'mcp_server_get_warehouse_user' to any part of the code that calls or processes its output; however, this snippet does not show such usage.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and only involves an import statement. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a simple import statement, which by itself is not suspicious. It references a function that might interact with system or network resources, but no such activity is evident here. Without additional context or usage, there are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or unusual patterns. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It is a standard part of modular Python code with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
