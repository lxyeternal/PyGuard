  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable access",
  "flows": "Reading the README file during setup execution, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'README.md' is standard, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, reads a README file for long description, and sets package requirements and classifiers. No malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no insecure practices are evident. The only operation is reading a local markdown file during setup, which is common practice.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not include any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
