  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package setup process for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setuptools for setup functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content during setup, then executing setup() to configure package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. Use of open() to read a local file is standard for package description.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, specifies package metadata, reads the README.md file for long description, and calls setup() with configuration parameters. No external input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior detected. The setup script is typical for Python packages. No indications of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is straightforward and safe for use.",
