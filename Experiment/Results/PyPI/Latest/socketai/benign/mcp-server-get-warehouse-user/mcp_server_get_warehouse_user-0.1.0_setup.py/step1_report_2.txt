  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package setup script for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Open and read 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' content into 'long_description' during setup execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and find packages. It reads a README file for the long description without any manipulation or external inputs. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling present. The structure and content are typical for a Python package setup script. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The code appears benign and intended solely for package distribution purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
