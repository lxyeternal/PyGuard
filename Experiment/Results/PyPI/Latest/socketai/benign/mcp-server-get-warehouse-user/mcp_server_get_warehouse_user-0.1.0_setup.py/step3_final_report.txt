  "purpose": "Configure package metadata and setup for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Reading local file 'README.md' during setup; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools to define package information. It reads a local README file for the long description, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, typical packaging script. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent, and no modifications are necessary.",
