  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data retrieval utility with significant security flaws, notably transmitting passwords in plaintext over HTTP and using hardcoded server addresses. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.6) due to insecure practices."
