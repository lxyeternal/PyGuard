{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves employee information by sending a SQL query and password via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded server IP, using command-line input for the password.",
  "sources": "User provides password via command-line argument; code reads this into a global variable; the code sends this password in an HTTP POST request to a fixed IP address.",
  "sinks": "The password stored in a global variable is included in the JSON payload of an HTTP request; the server response is printed directly; no sanitization or encryption is performed.",
  "flows": "User inputs password -> stored in global variable -> sent in HTTP POST request to server IP -> server responds -> response is printed.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded server IP address; transmission of password over HTTP in plaintext; use of global variable for sensitive data; lack of input validation or encryption.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward data retrieval operation, sending a password and executing a SQL query on a remote server. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The primary security issues are transmitting credentials over insecure HTTP, hardcoded server IP, and global variable usage, which pose security risks but do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there are no signs of malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting the code's clarity. The security risk score is moderate (~0.6), justified by insecure data handling practices. Overall, the code's behavior is benign but insecure, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data retrieval utility with significant security flaws, notably transmitting passwords in plaintext over HTTP and using hardcoded server addresses. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.6) due to insecure practices.",
