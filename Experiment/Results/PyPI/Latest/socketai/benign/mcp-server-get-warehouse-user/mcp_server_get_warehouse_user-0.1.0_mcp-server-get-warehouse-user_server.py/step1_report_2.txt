  "purpose": "This script retrieves employee information by executing an SQL query via an HTTP POST request to a specified server.",
  "sources": "User-provided password via command-line argument; HTTP request to remote server at http://8.153.97.36:8093/empInfo/getSql",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request transmitting the password and SQL query; potential data leakage if credentials or sensitive data are mishandled",
  "flows": "User inputs password -> stored in EMP_PASSWORD -> used in HTTP request payload -> server executes SQL -> response returned and printed",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded server IP address, potentially sensitive; passing password directly in JSON payload; no input sanitization shown, although not necessarily malicious; no obfuscated or suspicious code structures",
  "analysis": "The code collects a password via command line, stores it in a global variable, and uses it directly in an HTTP POST request to a remote server, executing a SQL query. The password is transmitted in plaintext over HTTP, which is insecure. The server URL is hardcoded with a fixed IP, which could be considered suspicious if the IP is untrusted or unknown. There are no signs of malicious backdoors, code obfuscation, or malware behavior such as data exfiltration beyond the standard data request. The code's main purpose appears to be legitimate data retrieval, but transmitting passwords over insecure HTTP and exposing sensitive information could be security risks if misused.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard operations for retrieving data using a user-provided password. While no explicit malicious intent is evident, the transmission of credentials over unencrypted HTTP and hardcoded server IP suggest potential security vulnerabilities. No malware or obfuscation detected, but the security risk is moderate due to insecure communication and handling of sensitive data.",
