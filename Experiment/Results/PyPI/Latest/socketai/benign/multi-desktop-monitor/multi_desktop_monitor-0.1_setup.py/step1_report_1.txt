  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the multi_desktop_monitor package, including dependencies and entry points for command-line scripts.",
  "sources": "No direct sources of untrusted data; static configuration only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; purely static package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard use of setuptools for package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, dependencies, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious URLs, or external data handling is present. The dependencies listed are common for a monitoring/dashboard application but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. Entry points define scripts that will run functions from specified modules; without access to these modules, we cannot determine their behavior, but the setup script itself appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard and contains no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures package metadata and entry points for execution.",
