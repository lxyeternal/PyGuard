  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'multi_desktop_monitor' Python package, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Package metadata, package discovery via find_packages(), and dependencies listed in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "Entry points for console_scripts that execute main functions from specified modules.",
  "flows": "The setup script installs dependencies and registers command-line entry points which, when invoked, run the main functions of the agent and dashboard modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. No malicious or hidden code present. Usage of common packages and straightforward entry point definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, specifying package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points. The dependencies are common for monitoring and web applications. The entry points invoke main functions from specific modules, which are not provided here but appear to be structured normally. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious code, or suspicious network behavior are present. The script does not perform any runtime operations or data handling itself; it merely defines installation parameters.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be legitimate and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior based on the provided content. It is a typical package configuration for a monitoring dashboard and agent system.",
