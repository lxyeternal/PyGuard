  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration defining dependencies and entry points for CLI tools.",

  "sinks": "Invocation of functions 'multiple_desktop_monitor.agent.agent:main' and 'multiple_desktop_monitor.dashboard.dashboard:main'.",
  "flows": "Setup script registers entry points; actual execution depends on external modules' 'main' functions.",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py is a typical, benign configuration script. It specifies dependencies and entry points without executing or embedding malicious code. The actual behavior and potential risks depend on the implementation of the 'main' functions in the referenced modules, which are not provided. The code itself shows no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security flaws. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified considering potential runtime behavior. Confidence in static analysis is high, as the script is straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is safe and standard. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The main security concern is the content of the invoked modules, which cannot be assessed here. The scores should reflect the benign nature of the setup configuration, with minimal risk due to external dependencies.",
