  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for the 'multi_desktop_monitor' Python package, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Read package dependencies from 'install_requires'; read entry point definitions from 'entry_points'.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of entry point scripts ('start_agent', 'start_dashboard') which could execute untrusted code if the source code of those scripts is malicious.",
  "flows": "Installation dependencies are loaded at setup time; entry points invoke 'main' functions from specified modules, which could be malicious if those modules contain malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration using setuptools, specifying package info, dependencies, and entry points. No code that processes user input or network data is included. The 'entry_points' suggest executable scripts, but their content is not shown; if those scripts are malicious, they could perform harmful actions. The dependencies listed are common packages for monitoring and web display, but they could also be used maliciously. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The script itself appears safe; potential risk depends on the content of the modules referenced in entry points.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script itself is standard and does not contain malicious code or obvious security risks. However, the actual behavior depends on the implementation of the 'main' functions in the specified modules. No malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies are evident in this setup configuration.",
