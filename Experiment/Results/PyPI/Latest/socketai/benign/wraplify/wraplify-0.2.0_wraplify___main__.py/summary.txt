  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate sandbox setup utility with insecure practices such as unvalidated inputs and permission changes, but no malicious behavior or malware. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a moderate security risk (~0.2-0.3) due to insecure system calls and input handling."
