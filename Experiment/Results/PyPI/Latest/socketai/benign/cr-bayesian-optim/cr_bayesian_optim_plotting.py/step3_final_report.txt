{
  "purpose": "This code visualizes extracellular data and cell positions from simulation outputs, generating images and compiling them into a movie.",
  "sources": "Data is read from external functions load_cells_at_iteration and load_subdomains_at_iteration; paths are used in os.system() calls for ffmpeg and firefox.",
  "sinks": "External commands executed via os.system() to generate and display videos, which could be exploited if input paths are manipulated.",
  "flows": "Data loaded -> visualization (images) saved -> external commands (ffmpeg, firefox) invoked to create/play movie.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with formatted strings containing output_path, which could be exploited if paths are untrusted; no input sanitization implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward visualization utility with no malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of os.system() with paths that may be influenced externally, posing a potential command injection risk if inputs are not validated. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are appropriate, reflecting the low but present risk associated with external command execution. To mitigate this, sanitizing input paths or replacing os.system() with subprocess.run() with argument lists is recommended. Overall, the code is benign, with the main concern being external command injection if inputs are untrusted, which can be addressed with proper validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization script with a minor security concern related to external command execution. The current scores are appropriate; no malicious activity is detected. Ensuring input sanitization would further reduce risk.",
