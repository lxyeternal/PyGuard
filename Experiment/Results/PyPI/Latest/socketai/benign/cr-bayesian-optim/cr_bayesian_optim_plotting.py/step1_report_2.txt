{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate visualizations and animations of cellular and extracellular data over multiple iterations, likely for simulation or analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from output_path directories using load_cells_at_iteration and load_subdomains_at_iteration functions; also reads image files for movie generation.",
  "sinks": "The code executes system commands to generate and play a video file using ffmpeg and firefox, which could be exploited if input paths are manipulated.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from files into numpy arrays, visualized with matplotlib, saved as images, then compiled into a video. System commands run at the end for video creation and playback.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the direct use of os.system() calls with formatted strings that include paths. If these paths are externally controlled, it could lead to command injection.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily processes and visualizes data with standard libraries, using functions to load data, generate plots, and create videos. It dynamically constructs system commands for ffmpeg and firefox without sanitizing input paths, which could pose a security risk if input paths are user-controlled. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors like data exfiltration are present. The code does not perform any network operations or contain obfuscated code. The use of multiprocessing for parallel plotting is standard. Overall, the code appears legitimate with a potential security concern related to os.system() usage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is intended for visualization and video creation from simulation data. It contains no evident malicious intent or malware. The only potential security risk is the unsanitized use of system commands with user-controlled paths, which could lead to command injection if input paths are externally manipulated.",
