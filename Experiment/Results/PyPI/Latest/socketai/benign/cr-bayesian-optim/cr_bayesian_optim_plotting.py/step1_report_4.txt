{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for visualizing simulation or computational data, specifically plotting cellular and extracellular information from multiple iterations, and optionally generating a video of the results.",
  "sources": "Reads data via load_cells_at_iteration and load_subdomains_at_iteration functions, and file inputs for images in 'images' directory.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system calls for executing ffmpeg and Firefox to create and play videos, which can potentially execute arbitrary commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from loading functions to visualization and image generation; external commands are invoked to generate and display videos.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes system commands for media processing and playback without validation, which could be exploited if input paths are manipulated. However, the command strings are hardcoded with variables, not user input, reducing risk. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard visualization techniques with matplotlib, handles multiple iterations for plotting, and generates videos using ffmpeg through os.system. The system commands use user-supplied paths but do not incorporate untrusted user input directly into commands without sanitization. The functions are structured logically, with no obfuscated or malicious code detected. The visualization and media generation are typical of scientific workflows. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical visualization utility for simulation data, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The use of os.system for media processing is standard but should be reviewed for path validation in a broader security assessment. Overall, the code appears benign and aligned with its intended purpose.",
