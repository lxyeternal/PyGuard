{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing simulation data, including plotting cell distributions and extracellular data, and generating movies from image sequences.",
  "sources": "Reads data via load_cells_at_iteration and load_subdomains_at_iteration functions, and accesses filesystem for images and output directories.",
  "sinks": "Executes system commands to generate and play movies; uses os.system to call ffmpeg and firefox.",
  "flows": "Loads data from files, generates plots, saves images, then calls system commands to create and display videos.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with string concatenation for executing external commands. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling observed. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors detected. No unusual data flows or obfuscation apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs visualization and video creation tasks based on simulation data. Data input sources are from data loading functions, and output sinks are filesystem writes and system calls. The system commands are straightforward, calling ffmpeg to create videos and optionally opening them in Firefox. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns detected. The external command execution via os.system with string formatting could be a minor security concern if inputs are not sanitized, but in this context, parameters are controlled within the code, not external inputs. Overall, the code is a typical visualization utility with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign visualization and media generation utility for simulation data, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of external system commands is standard for such tasks but warrants cautious handling if parameters are externally influenced.",
