{
  "purpose": "The code performs scientific data processing, including loading simulation results, discretizing spatial positions, plotting discretizations, and calculating fractal dimensions.",
  "sources": "File system reads for options files, data loading functions (load_cells, load_cells_at_iteration), and image saving routines.",
  "sinks": "Saving images of discretizations, reading options files, and writing output data locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads to in-memory processing, then to visualization outputs; no external network communication or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Usage of standard scientific libraries and straightforward code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code handles standard scientific tasks: loading options, checking existing files, running simulations if needed, discretizing spatial positions, plotting images, and calculating fractal dimensions. No external data transmission, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns. The functions operate on local files and data, with no network activity or external command execution. The code is clear, well-structured, and relies on common scientific libraries, indicating benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical scientific data analysis module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
