{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for loading, computing, and analyzing simulation data related to bacterial positions, including discretization and fractal dimension calculations.",
  "sources": "Reading options from file system, glob for file search, loading options via Options.load_from_toml, loading simulation results, and reading positional data (last_pos).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no data outputs or network connections observed. No untrusted data is being written or transmitted within this code.",
  "flows": "Inputs from file system or function parameters (options, last_pos). Data processed locally for discretization and plotting. No external data flows or transmission paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Functions perform standard file checks, data processing, and plotting.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily concerned with loading and processing simulation data, discretizing spatial positions, plotting images, and fitting curves for fractal analysis. It uses standard libraries such as numpy, scipy, tqdm, and PIL. No data is transmitted externally, and no hidden or malicious behaviors are evident. No suspicious code patterns, credential leaks, or backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward, focusing on scientific computation and visualization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard scientific data processing module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs file operations, data computations, and visualization tasks without suspicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
