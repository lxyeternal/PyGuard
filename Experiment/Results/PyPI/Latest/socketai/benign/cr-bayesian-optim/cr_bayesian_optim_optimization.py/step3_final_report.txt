  "purpose": "The code loads the last iteration data from disk, extracts positional information from simulation cells, and computes the fractal dimension and its uncertainty using external functions.",
  "sources": "load_or_compute_last_iter function reading data from storage_location; extraction of cell mechanics positions from cells.values()",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; no external network or file modifications beyond reading",
  "flows": "Data loaded from disk -> positional array created -> fractal dimension calculated -> results returned",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward scientific computation with clear data flow; no obfuscation or suspicious code constructs",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard scientific analysis routine: loading data, extracting positions, and computing fractal dimensions. It relies on trusted external modules and performs no network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The data flow is transparent, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The external functions used are typical for scientific workflows and are presumed trustworthy. Given the absence of malicious behaviors, external communication, or obfuscation, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific computation routine with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal risk associated with disk data loading in trusted environments.",
