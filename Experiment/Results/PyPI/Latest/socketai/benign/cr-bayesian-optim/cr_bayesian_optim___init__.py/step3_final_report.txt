{
  "purpose": "The code imports and utilizes functions from the 'cr_bayesian_optim' package to run a simulation with specified options.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'Options' object created via 'crb.Options()'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data; it primarily executes a simulation run, so no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input from 'Options' flows into 'run_sim_branching', which executes the simulation process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical usage example importing functions and executing a simulation with given options. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are evident. The code appears benign and aligns with expected usage of the package. The reports are empty, indicating no issues or concerns have been documented or identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not suggest any issues. Overall, the package appears secure and well-behaved.",
