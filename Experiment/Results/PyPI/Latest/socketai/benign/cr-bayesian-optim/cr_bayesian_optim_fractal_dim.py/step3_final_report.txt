{
  "purpose": "The code performs scientific analysis and visualization of fractal dimensions, loading data from files, computing fits, and generating plots, with no external command execution or network activity.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files, file modification times, and data from custom modules; no untrusted input handling or external commands.",
  "sinks": "Saves figures locally; no data exfiltration or external communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads into analysis functions, then into plotting routines, with results saved as figures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard scientific analysis script utilizing common libraries and custom modules for data processing and plotting. It reads local data, performs computations, and saves visualizations without network activity or suspicious behavior. External modules are used for legitimate scientific purposes. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The code's operations are typical for research workflows, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign scientific analysis script with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attack vectors. It operates solely on local data, with no external communication or obfuscation. The existing security scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
