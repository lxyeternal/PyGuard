{
  "purpose": "This code is for analyzing fractal dimensions, runtime, and diffusion constants in a simulation, generating plots and saving results.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files from specific directories, loads simulation data, and reads file modification times using os.path.getmtime.",
  "sinks": "Uses file operations for reading JSON files and file modification times; saves plots as PDF files to specified directories.",
  "flows": "Reads data from JSON files and file system metadata, processes and analyzes data, then outputs plots and saved files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious data leakage observed. No unusual code or backdoors present. External library usage appears standard for scientific analysis.",
  "analysis": "The script performs data loading, numerical computation, and plotting for scientific analysis. It accesses files for modification times and data files, but these are part of normal data processing workflows. No code executes external commands, network communications, or hidden behaviors. Use of third-party libraries like numpy, scipy, matplotlib, tqdm, and glob are typical for data analysis tasks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious injections, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific analysis script with no indications of malicious intent or supply chain security risks. It processes local data, generates plots, and saves files without suspicious behavior.",
