  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for configuring and installing a package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description, static metadata fields in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no dynamic code or network activity",
  "flows": "Static data read from file and passed to setup(), no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "Redundant import of both setuptools and distutils.core, but benign; no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools, with static metadata and a CLI entry point. It reads a local README.md file without validation, which is typical. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted data processing are present. The use of both setuptools and distutils.core is redundant but harmless. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious activity. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
