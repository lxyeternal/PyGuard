  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard setup script. It reads 'README.md' without validation, which is common practice.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Comments:** No issues. The reasoning is sound, and the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; standard setup code with static data. No suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Comments:** Correct conclusion; no security issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Also a typical setup script, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The use of both setuptools and distutils is redundant but benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Comments:** Well justified; no concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Standard package setup, reading 'README.md' without validation. No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Comments:** Appropriate assessment.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Typical setup script, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Comments:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code content:** All reports confirm the code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected across all reports; scores are appropriately zero.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** None evident; the code performs no network, data processing, or dynamic actions.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores.",
