  "purpose": "Fetches, maintains, and queries historical download information for Python packages from public APIs, storing data locally for analysis.",
  "sources": "Network responses from https://pypistats.org/api/packages/{package}/system and .../python_minor, local JSON files in user directory.",
  "sinks": "Local JSON files storing fetched data, output to console for user queries.",
  "flows": "Network response -> JSON parsing -> local storage or console output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data fetching from trusted APIs, processes JSON data, and stores it locally. No obfuscation or malicious activity is evident. Network requests are to reputable endpoints, and data handling is straightforward. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for managing package download statistics, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified by external network interactions, which are typical for such data collection tools.",
