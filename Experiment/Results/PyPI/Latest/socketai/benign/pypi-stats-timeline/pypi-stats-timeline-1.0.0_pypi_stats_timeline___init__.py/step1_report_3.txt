  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific function which is not explicitly stated, but appears to be related to data processing or utility operations.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, input parameters, and possibly from network sources if present. Specific source points are not explicitly shown in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output, file writing, network communication, or database queries if present. No explicit sinks are observed in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through processing functions to sinks such as output functions or network calls. No explicit flows are visible without additional context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are evident. The code does not contain obfuscation, unnecessary dynamic execution, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code appears clean, with standard usage of Python features. No malicious or suspicious patterns, such as code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices, are detected. Usage of third-party libraries is typical, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are identified within the analyzed fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to perform its intended function without malicious intent. The confidence level is high that this code is benign.",
