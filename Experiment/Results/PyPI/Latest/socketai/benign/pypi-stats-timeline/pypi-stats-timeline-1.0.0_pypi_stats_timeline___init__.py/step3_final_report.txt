{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be for benign data processing, module initialization, or system interaction without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules, defining functions/classes, handling input/output data.",
  "sinks": "Potential network or file operations, environment variable access, data output, but no malicious or suspicious functions identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs through functions to outputs or network/file sinks, with no suspicious or malicious pathways detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The confidence is high that the code is benign. No suspicious data flows or sinks are present. The scores reflect the benign assessment, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score of 0.1 to account for minimal inherent risk in benign data processing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no indicators of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the analysis is confident in this assessment. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
