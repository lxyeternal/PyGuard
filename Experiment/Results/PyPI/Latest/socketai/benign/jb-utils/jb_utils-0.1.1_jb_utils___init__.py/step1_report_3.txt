  "purpose": "This code acts as an export module for utility functions from the 'jb_utils' package, making them available for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports 'utils' module from 'jb_utils', which contains various utility functions and classes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling is evident within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions and re-exports them via __all__, with no internal data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from a utility module and defines an explicit __all__ list for exports. No data input, output, or processing occurs within this snippet. All functions are standard utility functions, and there is no evidence of malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and typical of a module export pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module that re-exports utility functions from 'jb_utils.utils' for external use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, or anomalies. It appears to be a standard, benign export module.",
