  "purpose": "This module re-exports utility functions and constants from jb_utils.utils for simplified external access.",
  "sources": "Imports from jb_utils.utils",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "None",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward re-export module with no runtime logic, data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. It imports functions and constants from a utility module and exposes them via __all__, serving as an interface for other modules. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate benign intent, with no data flows from untrusted sources or external effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for organizing utility functions. There are no security issues, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
