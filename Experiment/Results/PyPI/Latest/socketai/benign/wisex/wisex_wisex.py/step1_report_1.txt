  "purpose": "Definition of a class WiseX with a docstring and an empty constructor.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reads present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond class and method definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The constructor is empty; no code is executed beyond class structure. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class WiseX with a docstring describing its purpose and a method display_info() in the docstring, but no implementation of display_info() is provided. The constructor (__init__) is empty and does not perform any actions. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The structure appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple class skeleton with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. It does not perform any operations that could be exploited or malicious. Overall, it is a benign, incomplete class definition.",
