{
  "purpose": "Defines a class WiseX with a display_info method and an __init__ constructor, intended to represent an object with potential display capabilities.",
  "sources": "The __init__ method is a source, but it does not read or process any external input; no other data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform data output, external communication, or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs in this code; the class is incomplete and contains only a constructor with no operations.",
  "anomalies": "The __init__ method is a placeholder with no implementation, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with a docstring and an empty constructor. It lacks any logic, data handling, or external interactions. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The class appears incomplete or a stub, possibly for future development.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be a placeholder or template with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It does not perform any actions or handle sensitive data.",
