{
  "purpose": "A class to represent a WiseX object with a display_info() method.",
  "sources": "None, as the code contains only class and method definitions without data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None, since there are no data outputs, external communications, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; the class is a structural placeholder with no operational logic.",
  "anomalies": "The class has a docstring referencing a display_info() method that is not implemented; constructor is empty, indicating incomplete code but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class WiseX with a docstring and an empty constructor. No data inputs, outputs, external calls, or malicious patterns are present. The missing implementation of display_info() is benign and likely a placeholder. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code is a benign skeleton with no security or malicious concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, incomplete class skeleton with no malicious or security issues. The absence of implementation and operational logic indicates it is a placeholder, not malicious. The scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
