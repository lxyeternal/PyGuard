  "purpose": "Define a class WiseX with a method to display its information.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; class and method definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class is simply a structural definition.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only a class skeleton with no implementation details or data handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class WiseX with a docstring explaining its purpose and a method display_info() that prints class info, but neither method is implemented beyond the docstring. The __init__ method is empty, doing nothing upon instantiation. There are no data inputs, no external calls, no environment variables, or suspicious code constructs. It appears to be a simple skeleton for a class without malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic class skeleton with no operational logic, no input/output handling, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks.",
