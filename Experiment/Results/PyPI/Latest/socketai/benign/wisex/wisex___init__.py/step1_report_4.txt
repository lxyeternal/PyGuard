  "purpose": "The code imports a class or function named WiseX from a local module and a version string from another local module, likely for package initialization or API setup.",
  "sources": "Local module files: .wisex and ._version",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks present in the snippet",
  "flows": "Imports do not create data flow paths involving external or untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed in these import statements",
  "analysis": "The code only performs module imports, which are standard in Python packages. It references local modules to access classes and version info. No external data is read, no untrusted data is processed, and there are no suspicious patterns. The simplicity and typical structure suggest benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard module import statements with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
