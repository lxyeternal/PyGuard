  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive functions are identified",
  "anomalies": "Only straightforward import statements; no unusual code or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for internal modules. There are no functions, data processing, or external communication. This minimal structure indicates a standard module initialization or versioning setup. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign module import with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is a typical component of a package’s internal structure.",
