  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is just a set of straightforward import statements from internal modules (`wisex` and `_version`). There are no signs of data processing, external communication, or dynamic behavior. The code appears benign and typical for package setup.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is simple imports with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious behavior.  \n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1. Since the code is just internal imports, even a 0.1 might be slightly overstated. A value of 0 seems more appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nNo report indicates any suspicious activity, external communication, or dynamic code execution. Therefore, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified. The minimal risk should be 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll assessments are based on the code snippet provided, which is purely import statements. No assumptions about hidden behavior are made; the evaluations are appropriate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's nature. The only minor inconsistency is the one report with a 0.1 security risk score, which could be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (more appropriate than 0.1 in one report)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard module import block with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**In conclusion, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and best practices for assessing such code snippets.",
