{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes and version information from internal modules, likely for use within the package.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; imports from internal modules",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; merely imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module import statement, importing a class 'WiseX' from a local module 'wisex' and a version string from '_version'. There are no external network calls, no processing of untrusted input, and no suspicious behavior. The code structure appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module file. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of straightforward imports for module functionality and version tracking. No malicious intent or security risks are identified.",
