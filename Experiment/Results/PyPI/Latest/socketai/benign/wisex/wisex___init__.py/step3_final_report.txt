{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class 'WiseX' and a version string '__version__' from local modules, serving as part of package initialization or API exposure.",
  "sources": "Internal module files 'wisex' and '_version' providing class and version data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data flow present.",
  "flows": "Import statements load internal modules; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard import statements and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of internal import statements, typical for package setup. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors. The minor risk score of 0.1 in one report appears overly cautious; it should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module import pattern with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments are accurate; the minimal risk and malware scores should be 0, and obfuscation is absent.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
