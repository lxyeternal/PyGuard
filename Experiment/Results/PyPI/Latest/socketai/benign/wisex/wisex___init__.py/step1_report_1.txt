{
  "purpose": "Importing classes and version information from internal modules, likely for package initialization or setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads internal modules: 'wisex' and '_version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks; imports are static and for internal use.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be straightforward imports with no unusual or suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class 'WiseX' from a local module 'wisex' and a version string '__version__' from a local '_version' module. There is no input handling, data processing, or external communication. The simplicity and standard nature of these imports suggest normal package setup or initialization code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical import statement block used in Python packages for module setup. No malicious or security risks are present based on this snippet.",
