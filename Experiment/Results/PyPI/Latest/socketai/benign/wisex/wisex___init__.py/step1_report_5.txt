{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes and variables from internal modules, likely for use within the package or for exposing API features.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing 'WiseX' from '.wisex' and '__version__' from '._version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is being written, sent, or processed in a manner that leads to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways evident; the code only imports symbols for internal use or for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs imports of internal module components: 'WiseX' and '__version__'. These are standard practices for exposing functionality and package versioning. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling. The simplicity suggests it's part of package initialization or public API setup.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal code snippet, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard package code for exposing internal classes and version info.",
