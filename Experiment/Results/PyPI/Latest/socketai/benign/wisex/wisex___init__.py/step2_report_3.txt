  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code snippet is:\n     ```python\n     from .wisex import WiseX\n     from ._version import __version__\n     ```\n   - This is a standard import pattern in Python, typically found in `__init__.py` files or module setup scripts.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - They uniformly conclude the code is benign, with no security risks or malware indicators.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the code's simplicity.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The minor security risk score of 0.1 in report 3 seems slightly overcautious but not unreasonable given the context; it might be a default or conservative estimate.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, no malicious activity is evident.\n   - **Security Risk Score**:\n     - Most reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n     - Report 3 assigns 0.1; this could be a conservative placeholder but isn't justified by the code snippet.\n   - **Recommendation**: Keep the security risk at 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports assume the modules `wisex` and `_version` are safe, which is reasonable given the context.\n   - No assumptions about external data or network activity are made, which is correct.\n\n6. **Overall Risk and Malware Estimation**:\n   - Based on the code snippet and reports, the actual malware score should be **0**.\n   - The obfuscated score remains **0**.\n   - The security risk score should be **0** for consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Final Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a typical, benign module import statement with no security concerns.",
