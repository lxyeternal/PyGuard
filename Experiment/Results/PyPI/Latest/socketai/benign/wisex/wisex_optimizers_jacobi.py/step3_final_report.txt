  "purpose": "Assess the security and malicious potential of the provided Python code or dependency, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include code snippets, data processing routines, or external data reads within the dependency.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or sensitive operations), potentially through malicious or obfuscated code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is absent or minimal, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators detected. Scores for malware and obfuscation are zero, and security risk remains very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal potential threat. Confidence in benign assessment is high due to lack of evidence. No anomalous behaviors or suspicious data flows are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code or suspicious activity, the dependency poses negligible security risk. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
