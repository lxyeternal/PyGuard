Overall, the supply chain risk remains low, with no definitive malicious activity detected."

      "conclusion": "The code in the most suspicious report (Report 2) demonstrates behaviors consistent with moderate malicious intent, warranting a malware score of 0.6 and a security risk of 0.75. Benign reports are correctly scored with low or zero values. The overall assessment supports maintaining these scores, with the main concern centered on Report 2's suspicious patterns. No further adjustments are necessary at this stage."
