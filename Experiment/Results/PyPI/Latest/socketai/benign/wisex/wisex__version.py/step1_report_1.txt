  "analysis": "The code assigns a string to the variable '__version__', which is a common way to specify the version of a Python package or module. There are no input reads, no data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious constructs. The code is extremely simple and standard, with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical in open-source Python packages and does not raise any security concerns.",
