  "sources": "Assignment of string to __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted input/output",
  "flows": "None; simple assignment",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard code",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard assignment of a version string to __version__, with no input reads, network calls, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious behavior are present. The code aligns with common practices in Python packaging, and the scores are consistent with its simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
