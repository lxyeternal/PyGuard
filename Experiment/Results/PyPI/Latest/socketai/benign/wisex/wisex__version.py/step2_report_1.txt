  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the underlying code, which is a simple assignment:\n\n```python\n__version__ = '0.0.1'\n```\n\n**Step 1: Confirm presence of issues in the code**\n\n- The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no input reads, no data processing, no network calls, no obfuscation, and no suspicious constructs.\n- No malicious code, no obfuscation, no hidden behavior. The code is typical for Python packages.\n\n**Step 2: Review each report's reasoning and scores**\n\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, citing its simplicity and standard practice.\n- All assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- All assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is also correct given the code's clarity.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the reasonableness of scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent and appropriate. The code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty based on the simplicity.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any higher risk scores**\n\n- No reason exists to assign a higher risk score; the code is purely a version string declaration.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge assumptions**\n\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here, as the code is minimal and standard.\n- No hidden behaviors or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Step 6: Final assessment**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- Keep the scores as they are.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.**",
