  "purpose": "Analysis of Python package code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, imported modules, external URLs, hardcoded strings, dynamic execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable access, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs/env vars) to sinks (network/file operations) via code execution paths, including eval/exec or obfuscated code segments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, hardcoded credentials/URLs, dynamic code execution, unvalidated inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as eval/exec and obfuscated variables, indicating potential malicious intent. Hardcoded secrets and suspicious URLs further raise suspicion. No overt malicious actions like network exfiltration or system damage are confirmed, but risky practices are present. Benign code shows straightforward data processing without anomalies. Suspicious patterns justify higher malware and security risk scores, while benign code maintains low scores. The overall assessment aligns with the evidence, with Report 2 being the primary concern due to obfuscation and dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code in the most suspicious report (Report 2) demonstrates behaviors consistent with moderate malicious intent, warranting a malware score of 0.6 and a security risk of 0.75. Benign reports are correctly scored with low or zero values. The overall assessment supports maintaining these scores, with the main concern centered on Report 2's suspicious patterns. No further adjustments are necessary at this stage.",
