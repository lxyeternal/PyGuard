  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code sections involving dynamic execution, network connections, hardcoded secrets, environment variable reads, and import statements.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication functions, file modifications, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into functions that could send data or execute code, leading to sinks like network sockets or file system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded IPs/URLs, or suspicious import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks concrete snippets but suspicion arises from described behaviors such as obfuscation and dynamic execution. Without actual code, the suspicion remains speculative. The scores in the reports generally reflect this, with Report 1 indicating moderate suspicion (malware 0.4, obfuscated 0.6, risk 0.5). Other reports are consistent with benign code, showing low scores. Given the absence of confirmed malicious activity, the overall assessment should lean towards low likelihood of malware. The initial scores are reasonable, but to align with evidence, the malware score for Report 1 should be slightly reduced from 0.4 to around 0.2-0.3, and the obfuscation from 0.6 to about 0.2-0.3, unless concrete evidence of malicious code is provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears mostly benign with some suspicion in Report 1 due to obfuscation and dynamic features. Scores are generally appropriate; minor adjustments could be made to reflect the lack of confirmed malicious code. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low, with no definitive malicious activity detected.",
