  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Configuration data for package name, version, author, description, URL, classifiers, and Python requirement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration data is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "Package description mentions 'obfuscation test lib' and describes 'token obfuscation using string reversal with a flag,' but no such code is present; the description suggests possible obfuscation intention but not implemented here.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script that defines package metadata for distribution. No malicious or suspicious code is present. The description hints at obfuscation, but the script itself contains no actual obfuscation or malicious activity. No external inputs, secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be benign, serving solely as package configuration with no malicious or security-related issues. The mention of obfuscation is only in the description, with no actual obfuscation implemented.",
