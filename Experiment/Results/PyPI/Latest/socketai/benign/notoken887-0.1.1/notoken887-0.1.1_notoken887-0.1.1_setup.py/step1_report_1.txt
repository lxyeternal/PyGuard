{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887', primarily used for obfuscation demonstration.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata such as name, version, author info, description, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None of the data reads lead to data leaks or untrusted data processing within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Package metadata is defined and passed to the setup() function; no flow of untrusted data or malicious actions detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present; code appears straightforward and typical for a setup script. The description hints at obfuscation, but no actual obfuscation logic is implemented here.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with metadata parameters. No external input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed. The description mentions obfuscation, but the script itself does not perform any obfuscation or malicious activity. The URL provided is a placeholder and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears benign and typical for packaging purposes.",
