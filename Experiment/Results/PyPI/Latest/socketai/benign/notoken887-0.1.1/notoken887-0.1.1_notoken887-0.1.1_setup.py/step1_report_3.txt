{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library, primarily to specify package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata such as package name, version, author, description, URL, classifiers, and Python requirements.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this code; it does not handle untrusted input or perform data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the script only defines package metadata without processing user input or external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The package description mentions 'obfuscation' but the code itself is standard setup configuration with no malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata and dependencies. There is no code execution, no data handling, and no suspicious behavior. The description referencing 'token obfuscation' appears to be a comment about the package's purpose, not an actual malicious feature. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The mention of 'obfuscation' is related to package description, not code obfuscation or malicious intent.",
