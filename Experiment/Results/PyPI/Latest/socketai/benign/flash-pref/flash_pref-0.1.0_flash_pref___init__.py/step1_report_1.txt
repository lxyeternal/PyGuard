  "purpose": "The code is intended to import the 'shared_prefix' function or variable from the 'flash_pref.shared_prefix' module and expose it for external use, along with setting a version identifier.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'shared_prefix' from a specific module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code only performs a straightforward import and assignment; no data flow analysis is applicable beyond initial import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal, importing a specific component from a package and defining module-level variables. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing that could pose security risks. The import appears standard, assuming the package is legitimate. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module setup with an import statement and versioning; it does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
