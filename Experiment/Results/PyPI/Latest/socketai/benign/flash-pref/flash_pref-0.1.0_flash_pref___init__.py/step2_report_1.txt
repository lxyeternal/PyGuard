  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided reports and the original code.\n\n1. Confirm if issues are present:\n- The code is a straightforward module that imports 'shared_prefix' from 'flash_pref.shared_prefix', sets a version, and exposes it via __all__. \n- All reports agree that there are no data flows, no untrusted input handling, and no suspicious patterns.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, minimal, and standard for module setup.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. Scores evaluation:\n- All reports assign maximum confidence (1) and zero scores for obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk.\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since the code is purely import/export with no data processing, no external input, and no side effects, a risk score above 0.5 is unjustified.\n- The current score of 0 for securityRisk and malware is correct.\n\n5. Malware score:\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, does not execute dynamic code, and does not handle untrusted data.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions; they rely on code inspection and standard security reasoning.\n\n7. Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal, benign module setup.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports' evaluations are accurate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Security risk score: 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, standard module import/export pattern with no security issues. All scores should remain at zero, reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.",
