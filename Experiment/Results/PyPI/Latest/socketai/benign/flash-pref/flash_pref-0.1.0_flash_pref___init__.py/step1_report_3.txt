{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named shared_prefix from a module within the flash_pref package and defines versioning information and export variables.",
  "sources": "Import statement from flash_pref.shared_prefix",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the import is static and does not process external data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of an import statement, version declaration, and export list. It does not contain any data processing, user input, or external communication. The imported module is part of a package, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply re-exports a function and defines package metadata.",
