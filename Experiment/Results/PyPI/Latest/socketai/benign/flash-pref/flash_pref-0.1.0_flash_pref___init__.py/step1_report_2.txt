{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'shared_prefix' from a module 'flash_pref.shared_prefix' and exposes it via __all__, likely as part of a package's interface.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'shared_prefix' from another module within the package.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import statement reads the 'shared_prefix' function; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a version string, specifies exports, and imports a function from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. It appears to be standard package setup code. No external input, no data processing, and no side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be a standard module import and export setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
