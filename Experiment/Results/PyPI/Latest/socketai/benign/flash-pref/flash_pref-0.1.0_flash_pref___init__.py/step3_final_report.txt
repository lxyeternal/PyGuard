  "purpose": "A minimal Python module that imports 'shared_prefix' from 'flash_pref.shared_prefix', sets a version, and exposes it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'shared_prefix' from 'flash_pref.shared_prefix'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling, external communication, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import source to module namespace; no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup: importing a function, defining a version, and exposing the function via __all__. No data processing, user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is syntactically correct, simple, and standard. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. All reports agree on its benign nature, with high confidence (1). The malware score is justified as 0, as no malicious actions are performed. The security risk score is 0, given the lack of vulnerabilities or risky operations. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module import/export pattern with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. All reports' assessments are accurate and justified. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
