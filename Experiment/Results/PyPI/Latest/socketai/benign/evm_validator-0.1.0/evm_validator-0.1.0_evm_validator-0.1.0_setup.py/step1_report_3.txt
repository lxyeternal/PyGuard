  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package named 'evm_validator' for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "N/A - The code does not read external input or untrusted data; it reads static configuration data for package setup.",
  "sinks": "N/A - The code does not process or output untrusted data; it only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code purely defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard setup procedures with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and other configuration options. It reads the README.md file for long description, which is standard practice. No code injection, dynamic execution, or malicious logic is present. The dependencies are explicitly listed with no signs of obfuscation or malicious imports. The code structure and content follow common Python packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is a typical package configuration file with no indications of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intended solely for packaging purposes.",
