  "purpose": "Configure the packaging and installation parameters for the 'evm_validator' Python project.",
  "sources": "Read the package dependencies from the 'install_requires' list and read the long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or executed in a risky manner.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; package configuration does not process external input during execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads a long description from a local 'README.md' file and specifies package requirements. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or data leaks. No obfuscation or malicious logic detected. The script adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves its intended purpose of package configuration safely.",
