{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description, defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or system modifications; only static metadata assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open(\"README.md\").read()' without exception handling; typical in setup scripts but could cause errors if file missing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input processing. It relies on standard libraries and practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The only minor issue is the lack of exception handling when reading the README file, which does not impact security but could affect robustness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
