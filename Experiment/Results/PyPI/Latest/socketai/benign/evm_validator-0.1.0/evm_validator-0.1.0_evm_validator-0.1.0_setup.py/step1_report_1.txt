  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'evm_validator' Python package including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "User input through setup() parameters, reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None that directly lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No untrusted data flows to potentially dangerous sinks.",
  "flows": "Input data from package configuration flows to package metadata and description fields; reading 'README.md' as file input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() without exception handling could be problematic if file is missing, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. It imports only standard and widely used libraries. No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no network activity. The only file I/O is reading a README file for description, which is typical. The dependencies are standard, and no unusual code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate package configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical setup tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
