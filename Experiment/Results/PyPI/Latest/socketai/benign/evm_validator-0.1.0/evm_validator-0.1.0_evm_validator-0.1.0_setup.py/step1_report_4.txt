{
  "purpose": "Configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution of the 'evm_validator' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading package information (name, version, author, description), reading 'README.md' for long description, calling find_packages() to list packages, importing 'requests' as a dependency.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or inputs; the code primarily sets up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; package setup commands do not process external input at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Open reading of 'README.md' without sanitization or validation; no validation or filtering of the file content, but this is standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for packaging Python modules. It imports 'setuptools', defines package metadata, specifies dependencies, and reads the long description from a file. There are no dynamic code evaluations, no user input processing, and no suspicious code constructs. The only potential concern is reading 'README.md' without error handling, but this is standard practice and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging Python software with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any obfuscated code, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
