{
  "purpose": "To configure and set up the 'evm_validator' Python package for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads package requirements from the 'install_requires' list and reads the long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly interacts with untrusted input or data sinks that could cause leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The package setup information flows from static code definitions; no external untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and description files. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident. The 'install_requires' only lists the 'requests' library, which is a common dependency. The code reads 'README.md' content for the long description, which is typical. No suspicious code patterns or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign package setup script for distributing a Python package. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
