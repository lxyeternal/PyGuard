  "sinks": "None directly present; no data processing or output functions shown.",
  "flows": "None demonstrated in this snippet; no source-to-sink data flow observable.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of context; the import appears straightforward. No suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import from a module named 'valid' to bring in 'validator'. There are no dynamic imports, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. It doesn't perform any operations or data handling itself; it merely imports a component. Without additional code, there are no evident security issues, malicious behavior, or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a benign import statement with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard import of a validator component from a local module.",
