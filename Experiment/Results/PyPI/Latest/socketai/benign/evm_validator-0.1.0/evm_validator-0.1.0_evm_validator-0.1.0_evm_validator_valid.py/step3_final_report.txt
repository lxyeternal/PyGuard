{
  "purpose": "The code constructs a URL with untrusted input and makes an HTTP GET request to that URL.",
  "sources": "The function takes 'data' as input and uses it directly in the URL string for requests.get.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends data over the network to an external domain, potentially exposing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input 'data' flows directly into the URL used in requests.get, which is then sent over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No validation or sanitization of 'data'; exception handling is silent; no obfuscation or malicious payloads present.",
  "analysis": "The code takes untrusted input and embeds it directly into an external URL, making an HTTP request. It catches request exceptions but ignores errors, always returning None. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is potential SSRF if 'data' is maliciously crafted. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The risk stems from unvalidated external requests, which could be exploited but do not constitute malicious behavior themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign but poses a potential SSRF risk due to lack of input validation. No malware or obfuscation is detected. The security risk score of approximately 0.2–0.3 is appropriate, reflecting low to moderate concern over misuse. All reports correctly identify these aspects and assign consistent scores.",
