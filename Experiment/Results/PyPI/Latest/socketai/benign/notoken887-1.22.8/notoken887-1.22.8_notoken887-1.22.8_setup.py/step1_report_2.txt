  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Package metadata such as name, version, author info, description, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows that process untrusted input; static setup configuration.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static package metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual author email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org' may be suspicious or unprofessional; no actual malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata. No dynamic code, user input handling, or execution of untrusted data is present. The only notable anomaly is the author email and URL, which are inappropriate and could be considered malicious or unprofessional, but do not constitute malicious code. No suspicious code behavior, obfuscated code, or malware patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no malicious code or malware. The main concern is the inappropriate contact information, which may be intended for misrepresentation or malicious intent outside the code itself but does not involve malicious programming constructs.",
