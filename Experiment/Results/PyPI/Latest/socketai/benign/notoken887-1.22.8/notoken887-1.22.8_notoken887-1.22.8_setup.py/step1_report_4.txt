  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data is hardcoded in the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; no data output or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious email address ('hitler@gmail.com') used as author contact; the URL 'https://thugging.org' is potentially malicious or inappropriate. No obfuscation or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging using setuptools, with typical fields such as name, version, packages, author, and description. The only anomalies are the author email and URL, which could be considered unprofessional or malicious in nature, but they do not pose a direct security threat or contain malicious code. No suspicious code execution, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal setup script with intentionally unusual contact information and URL. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware within the code itself.",
