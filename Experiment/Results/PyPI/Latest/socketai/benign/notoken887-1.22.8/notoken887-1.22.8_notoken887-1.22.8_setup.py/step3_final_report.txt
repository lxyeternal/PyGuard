  "purpose": "This setup.py script defines package metadata for the 'notoken887' Python package, including name, version, author info, description, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirement.",
  "sources": "Static strings in the setup() call: name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data handling beyond static configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks as the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of suspicious contact info: author_email='hitler@gmail.com' and url='https://thugging.org', which are unprofessional and provocative but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with static metadata. No dynamic code, input handling, or malicious payloads are present. The only anomalies are the provocative contact details, which do not constitute security threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.2) due to unprofessional contact info. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior is found. The contact info could be flagged for social or reputational concerns but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard, with unprofessional contact details. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
