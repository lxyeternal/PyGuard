{
  "purpose": "To define and configure a Python package named 'notoken887' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments in the setup() function, including package name, version, author, email, description, URL, classifiers, and Python requirement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration with no dynamic or input-driven data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org'), which may be suspicious or inappropriate; no code obfuscation or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools, with typical configuration parameters. The author email and URL are potentially malicious or inappropriate but are static strings and do not pose security risks by themselves. No dynamic code, input handling, or suspicious behaviors are detected. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The code appears benign but contains potentially offensive or unprofessional contact details.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected based on the provided code. The main concern is the inappropriate email and URL, which are not inherently malicious but may warrant review for trustworthiness.",
