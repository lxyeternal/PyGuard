  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly clear due to lack of comments and context. It appears to be a minimal or incomplete snippet.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not evident; there are no explicit data reads, user inputs, or external data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications are present in the visible code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable due to the absence of input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no noticeable anomalies, suspicious constructs, or hardcoded secrets. It appears to be an incomplete or trivial snippet.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is either an empty file or a non-functional fragment with no operational logic. Without any imports, functions, or data handling, it is not possible to assess malicious behavior or security risks. No sources or sinks are present, and the structure offers no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit any signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be benign or incomplete. Due to the lack of substantive content, confidence in this conclusion is high.",
