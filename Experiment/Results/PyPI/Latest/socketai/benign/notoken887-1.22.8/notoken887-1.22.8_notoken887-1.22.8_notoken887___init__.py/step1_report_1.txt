  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is not explicitly clear without more context.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly defined; if present, they could include environment variables or external file reads (not shown in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but none are explicitly observed in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flow can be identified due to the absence of data input or output operations in the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious API calls, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure is straightforward with no unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python without signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. It lacks external data sources, sinks, or suspicious operations. Without additional context or external dependencies, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious operations identified.",
