  "purpose": "A simple class to perform basic character replacements for encryption and decryption of strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the methods only perform string replacements without external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input string → 'encrypt' method → replaced string; Input encrypted string → 'decrypt' method → original string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code constructs, no dynamic execution or obfuscation. The code performs straightforward character replacement.",
  "analysis": "The class provides basic 'encryption' by replacing specific characters with symbols and 'decryption' by reversing these replacements. There are no external data inputs, network connections, or sensitive operations. The approach is simplistic and not secure as encryption, but there are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple character-mapping utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or contain malicious code. Its purpose appears to be obscuring strings in a very basic manner, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
