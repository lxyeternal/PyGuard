  "purpose": "The class provides simple string-based encryption and decryption methods using character replacement.",
  "sources": "Input strings to encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "Return values of encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via character replacement and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of character replacement for encryption is weak and reversible; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods that perform character substitutions for 'encryption' and 'decryption'. The process is straightforward, replacing specific characters with other characters. There are no external data sources, no network activity, no handling of environment variables, and no other signs of malicious behavior. The simplicity suggests it is not meant for secure encryption but possibly obfuscation or a trivial encoding. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. No data leakage, unsafe SQL, or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple reversible character substitution with no malicious intent or security risks. It is not secure encryption but rather a basic obfuscation method. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
