  "purpose": "A simple class providing basic string obfuscation by replacing certain characters with symbols and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "Returns from encrypt and decrypt methods, potentially used elsewhere in a larger system.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace characters -> output string; Encrypted token -> reverse replacements -> original string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no external data access, no network activity, and no obfuscation or malicious code patterns. The replacement logic is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The class implements basic character replacement for obfuscation purposes. The methods operate solely on input strings, replacing specific characters with symbols and vice versa. There are no external inputs, no data leakage, and no code injection points. The logic appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or hidden backdoors. The code’s simplicity and lack of external interactions suggest it’s intended for simple obfuscation or encoding.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and designed for basic character substitution obfuscation without any malicious behavior. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is likely to obscure strings minimally. No security issues are identified.",
