{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be simple string obfuscation or encoding, transforming specific characters into symbols and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings to perform character replacements during encryption and decryption.",
  "sinks": "The functions return modified strings; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace certain characters -> output obfuscated string; encrypted token -> reverse replacements -> decrypted original string.",
  "anomalies": "The methods perform straightforward character replacements with no external data handling, environment interactions, or security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present. The code lacks any network, file I/O, or privilege escalation features.",
  "analysis": "The class provides two methods: 'encrypt' and 'decrypt', which perform character substitutions to obfuscate and recover strings. The implementation is simplistic and does not include any security mechanisms like cryptographic encryption. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic character substitution utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be intended for simple obfuscation purposes without malicious intent.",
