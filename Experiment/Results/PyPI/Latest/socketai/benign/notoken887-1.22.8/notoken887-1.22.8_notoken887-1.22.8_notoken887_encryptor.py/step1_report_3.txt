  "purpose": "A simple class providing basic string obfuscation through character replacement for encryption and decryption.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "Returned strings; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace method -> output encrypted/decrypted string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The methods perform straightforward string replacements without any external dependencies or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The class offers basic character substitution encryption, which is not secure for sensitive data. There are no external data reads, no network connections, and no suspicious code constructs. The code appears to be simple obfuscation rather than malicious activity. No signs of malware such as data theft, system manipulation, or backdoors are present. The implementation is minimalistic, focusing solely on replacing specific characters to obscure the input.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic, insecure string substitution for obfuscation purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a trivial, non-security-related utility.",
