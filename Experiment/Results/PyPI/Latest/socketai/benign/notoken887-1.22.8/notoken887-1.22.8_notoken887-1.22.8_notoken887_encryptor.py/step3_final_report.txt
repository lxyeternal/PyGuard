  "purpose": "Simple reversible character substitution for obfuscation or encoding.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "Replaced characters returned as output; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input string -> character replacements in encrypt/decrypt -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static replacements, no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static, reversible character replacements without external dependencies or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the simplicity and benign nature of the code. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate; the code is trivial and not malicious. The logic is clear, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, trivial string obfuscation utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports accurately reflect this, and their scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
