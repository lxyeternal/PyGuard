{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyhack' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; static data within 'setuptools.setup()' such as package info, author details, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no code executes untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets (beyond standard package metadata), or suspicious patterns. No obfuscation or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and reads a README file to set up package metadata and dependencies. It does not include code execution, network calls, or any data processing. The dependencies listed are common Python packages, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code strictly performs static setup configuration, which is typical for Python packaging. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for package distribution with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies.",
