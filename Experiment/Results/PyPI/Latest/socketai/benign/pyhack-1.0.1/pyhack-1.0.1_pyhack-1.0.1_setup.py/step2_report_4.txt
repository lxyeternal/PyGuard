  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a standard setup script using setuptools.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected.\n- Dependencies are common and benign.\n- The code reads a local README.md file and calls `setuptools.setup()` with static data.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it reads \"README.md\" and calls `setuptools.setup()` with package info and dependencies.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- No external network calls, code injection, or dynamic behavior.\n- All dependencies are typical for packaging.\n\n### Issue presence:\n- **No issues are present in the code.** The code is a standard setup script.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent; no errors or flaws are identified.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n### Score analysis:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is correct. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- No reason exists to assign higher scores; the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- The code does not process untrusted input, does not execute external commands, and does not contain any suspicious logic.\n- The dependencies are standard modules, not malicious.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The dependency list and code structure are standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate; no modifications needed. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
