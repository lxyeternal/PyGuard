{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata and dependencies specified directly in code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network calls, dynamic code execution, or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from file read and package metadata into setuptools.setup() call; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows common packaging patterns without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads a local README file and calls setuptools.setup() with predefined metadata and dependencies. All dependencies are common modules related to file handling, compression, PDF processing, and HTTP requests. No dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code structure is simple and standard, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content. The confidence level is high (1), as the code is clearly benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The dependency choices are common and safe. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No adjustments are necessary.",
