  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'pyhack' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, defining package setup parameters, specifying dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink for untrusted data or code execution. The code does not execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks. The dependencies are specified statically.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup procedure for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file for long description and defines package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or untrusted input handling is present. All dependencies are typical for packaging and do not indicate malicious intent. The code structure and content appear normal and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
