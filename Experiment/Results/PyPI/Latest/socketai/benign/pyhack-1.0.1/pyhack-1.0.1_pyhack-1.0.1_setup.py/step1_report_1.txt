  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyhack' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data outputs or dangerous actions are present.",
  "flows": "Reading file content as input for long_description; passing setup parameters with no external data flow or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The package metadata appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local README.md file to include as long_description, then calls setuptools.setup with package info and dependencies. Dependencies are common and do not indicate malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or external communications are present. The setup script is typical for packaging Python projects. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines package metadata and dependencies, which are safe.",
