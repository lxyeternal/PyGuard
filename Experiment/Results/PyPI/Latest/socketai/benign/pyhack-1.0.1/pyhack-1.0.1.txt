      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The dependency choices are common and safe. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No adjustments are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement with no signs of malicious activity. The use of 'import *' can be a security concern in larger contexts but is not inherently malicious here. The scores and assessments across the reports are appropriate and consistent. Further review of the 'core' module is recommended to ensure it does not contain malicious code, but the snippet itself is safe."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code contains features that could be exploited maliciously, notably the remote download and execution of 'WA.cmd' without validation, along with system decryption and password cracking capabilities. These features justify a high malware score (~0.75) and security risk (~0.75). The code is clear and not obfuscated, but its functionalities pose significant security concerns if misused. It should be considered high risk and potentially malicious, especially in untrusted environments."
