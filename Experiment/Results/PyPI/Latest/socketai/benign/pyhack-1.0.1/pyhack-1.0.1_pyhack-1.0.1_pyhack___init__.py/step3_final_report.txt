  "purpose": "Import all components from the local 'core' module using relative import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*'), which can obscure imported components and potentially hide malicious code within 'core'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import from a local module named 'core'. The use of 'import *' is discouraged because it can hide imported components, making security audits more difficult. No malicious activity or suspicious behavior is evident from this snippet alone. The import is benign, but the potential for malicious code within 'core' remains if that module is compromised. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the minimal and benign nature of this code. The primary concern is the wildcard import pattern, which warrants further review of the 'core' module itself, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement with no signs of malicious activity. The use of 'import *' can be a security concern in larger contexts but is not inherently malicious here. The scores and assessments across the reports are appropriate and consistent. Further review of the 'core' module is recommended to ensure it does not contain malicious code, but the snippet itself is safe.",
