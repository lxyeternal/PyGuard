  "purpose": "Imports all components from the core module within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local package module (.core)",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "N/A (single import statement, no data flow or execution logic present)",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code, but not inherently malicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement using a relative import to bring all symbols from the core module into the current namespace. There is no execution logic, data handling, or other code present. The use of 'from .core import *' can be considered a potential risk if the core module contains malicious or unintended code, but in isolation, this statement alone does not exhibit malicious behavior. It is a common pattern in package initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a simple import statement with no explicit malicious behavior. However, the use of wildcard import is discouraged as it can obscure imported contents. No signs of malware or security risks are evident in this fragment.",
