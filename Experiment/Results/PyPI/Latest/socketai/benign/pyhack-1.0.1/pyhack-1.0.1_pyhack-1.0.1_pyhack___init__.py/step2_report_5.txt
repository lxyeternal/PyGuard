  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue Present?** No. The code is just a relative import statement, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The reasoning correctly states that import alone isn't malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.8. These seem reasonable; the low security risk reflects the minimal code.\n- **Justification for scores:** The low malware and risk scores are appropriate; the confidence is high due to the simplicity of the code.\n- **Overall:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue Present?** No explicit malicious activity. It's just an import statement.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** The report emphasizes that wildcard imports can obscure what's imported, which is accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.7. These are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** Since the import is benign but the use of '*' can hide malicious code in 'core', a slight security risk is justified.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue Present?** No direct malicious activity, but the report suggests further review of 'core' is needed.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** Correctly notes that 'import *' can hide malicious components, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.4. The lower confidence reflects the cautious stance.\n- **Justification:** The concern about potential hidden malicious code in 'core' is valid, but since the import is just a statement, no actual malware is present.\n- **Overall:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue Present?** No. The import statement alone isn't malicious.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** The analysis is thorough, emphasizing the risks of wildcard import but noting no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.6. Appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue Present?** No. The import is straightforward and benign.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The report correctly states that this is a simple, safe import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1. Appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the fact that these are simple import statements without malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low across the board, justified by the minimal code.\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the uniformity and simplicity of the code snippets, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the general risk associated with wildcard imports and reliance on external modules that could be malicious)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious code if the 'core' module is compromised, but there is no evidence of malicious activity in these snippets.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; scores are appropriate. Further review of the 'core' module is advised to ensure it doesn't contain malicious code, especially given the use of wildcard imports.",
