  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code only performs a relative import from 'core'.\n- No data flows, sinks, or malicious activity.\n- The reasoning is sound; the import alone is benign.\n- Confidence is high (0.8), and the malware score is 0.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the use of wildcard import ('*').\n- Recognizes that this pattern can obscure imported contents but is not inherently malicious.\n- No data flow or execution logic.\n- Confidence is 0.7; malware score is 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. Wildcard import is discouraged but not malicious here. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the use of 'from .core import *'.\n- Highlights the potential for hiding malicious code within 'core'.\n- Notes that further inspection of 'core' is necessary.\n- Confidence is lower (0.4), but malware remains 0.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is cautious and appropriate; the import pattern warrants further review but isn't malicious by itself.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizes the risks of wildcard import.\n- No other suspicious activity.\n- Confidence is 0.6; malware is 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Declares the import as benign, with full confidence (1.0).\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malware indicators.\n- Recognizes that it's a straightforward import.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as the code snippet is just an import statement with no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign low risk (0.1–0.2), which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n### My Overall Evaluation:\n- The code is a simple, benign import statement. While the use of 'import *' can be considered a security concern in larger contexts, in this isolated snippet, it does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The only potential concern is the use of wildcard import, which could hide malicious code if the 'core' module is compromised. However, without inspecting 'core', this remains speculative.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- If I were to assign an overall score considering the minimal code and lack of malicious activity, I would keep:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.2 (due to the wildcard import pattern, which warrants cautious review of 'core').\n\n**In conclusion,** all reports are accurate and consistent. No significant adjustments are necessary.",
