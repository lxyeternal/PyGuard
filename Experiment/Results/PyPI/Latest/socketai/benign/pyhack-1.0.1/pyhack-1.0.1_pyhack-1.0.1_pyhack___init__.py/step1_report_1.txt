{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'core'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package (relative import).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing present; import statement alone does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed, as the code only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a relative import with a wildcard may obscure the source of imported components but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a relative import statement. Relative imports can be used legitimately in package structures but can also hide dependencies or malicious modules if used deceptively. There are no signs of data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior in this single line. Without additional context or code, there are no clear indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard import from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet. The import style is somewhat unusual but not suspicious on its own.",
