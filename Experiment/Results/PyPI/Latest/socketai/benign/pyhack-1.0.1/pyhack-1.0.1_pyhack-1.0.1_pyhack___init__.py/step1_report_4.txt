  "purpose": "Import all contents from the core module within the same package",

  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or output functions shown",
  "flows": "No flow identified; only an import statement without further data handling",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*'), which can obscure imported entities and potentially hide malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement that imports all symbols from a module named 'core' within the same package. Wildcard imports are discouraged because they make it difficult to track imported symbols, which can be exploited to introduce malicious code or hide malicious behavior. No other code, data input/output, or suspicious patterns are present. As this is only an import statement, it does not itself execute malicious behavior but warrants further inspection of the 'core' module for malicious or maliciously crafted code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is minimal and contains only a wildcard import statement. While it does not directly exhibit malicious behavior, the use of wildcard import warrants caution as it can mask malicious code within the imported module. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present in this snippet alone, but further review of 'core' is advised.",
