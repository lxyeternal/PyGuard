  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'moldo' Python package, intended to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description. Other data is static or from standard library functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present. No sensitive data or user input handling is observed.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading static package metadata and description files; no dynamic data flow or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code uses standard setup procedures and functions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package information, dependencies, entry points, and metadata. It reads the README.md file for the long description, which is a common practice. The code does not contain any code execution, input handling, or external communications. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior is evident. The overall structure and content are standard for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
