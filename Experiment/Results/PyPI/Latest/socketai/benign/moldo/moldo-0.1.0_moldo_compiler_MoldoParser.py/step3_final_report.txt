{
  "purpose": "A generated parser from ANTLR for a custom markup language with embedded Python code tokens.",
  "sources": "Input tokens such as '<mblock', '<python>', 'TEXT', and 'PYTHON_CODE' tokens.",
  "sinks": "No data transmission or code execution within this parser; potential risk if embedded Python code tokens are executed downstream.",
  "flows": "Input tokens are parsed into a syntax tree; no execution or data leakage occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; standard generated parser.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated parser recognizing specific markup tags and embedded Python code. It does not execute code, transmit data, or contain obfuscation. The only potential concern is the 'PYTHON_CODE' tokens, which could be misused if executed outside this parser context. Scores reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a very low risk accounting for downstream use of embedded code.",
  "conclusion": "The parser is benign, standard, and safe. The minimal risk score accounts for potential misuse of embedded Python code tokens if later executed maliciously outside this scope.",
