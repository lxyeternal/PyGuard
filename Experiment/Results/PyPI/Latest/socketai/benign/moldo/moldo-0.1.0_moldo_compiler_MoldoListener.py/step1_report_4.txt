{
  "purpose": "This code defines a parse tree listener class for the Moldo language grammar, intended for use with ANTLR4 parser generation. It provides hooks for entering and exiting parse tree nodes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for antlr4 library and conditional import of MoldoParser. No data input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; methods are placeholders without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate for an ANTLR4 listener with no operational code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports ANTLR4 components and conditionally imports a parser class, then defines a listener class with empty methods for parse events. All methods are pass-through with no data processing. No code execution, data handling, or external communication occurs. The code is typical of generated parser listeners and contains no suspicious or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is boilerplate generated by ANTLR for a language parser. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and intended solely for parse tree event handling.",
