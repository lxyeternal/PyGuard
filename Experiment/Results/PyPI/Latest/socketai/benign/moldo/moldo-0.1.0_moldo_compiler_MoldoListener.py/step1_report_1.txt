{
  "purpose": "This code defines a listener class for an ANTLR-generated parser for a language called Moldo, primarily used for parsing and processing code structures.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own source file during execution, but does not process external inputs or data streams.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in the code; it does not process or output untrusted data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the class contains only empty method definitions for parse tree events.",
  "anomalies": "The code is largely boilerplate generated code with no logic, variables, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a generated skeleton listener class from ANTLR, meant to be extended for custom behavior during parse tree traversal. It contains no executable logic or data handling. It imports the necessary parsing classes and defines empty event handler methods. The structure appears standard for such generated code and does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, generated parser listener skeleton with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely structural boilerplate meant for extension, with no evidence of sabotage, malware, or security issues.",
