{
  "purpose": "Defines a parse tree listener class for a Moldo language parser generated by ANTLR, with no implementation logic.",
  "sources": "Import statements for ANTLR runtime and the MoldoParser module; class definition and method signatures for parse tree events.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing, input/output, or external connections are made within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the methods are empty and do not process or handle data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard ANTLR listener template with no embedded logic or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated parse tree listener class with all methods implemented as placeholders (pass statements). It imports necessary modules and defines methods for parse tree events without any logic. No data handling, no code execution beyond class and method definitions, and no suspicious patterns or embedded malicious code. The structure and content align with typical parser listener templates.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign auto-generated parser listener with no malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no suspicious logic, no external connections, and no data leaks. Its purpose is to serve as a template for further implementation.",
