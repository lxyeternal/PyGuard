  "purpose": "Boilerplate auto-generated parser listener class for the Moldo language, intended for extension with custom logic.",
  "sources": "Import statements based on module context; no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, external interactions, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; methods are empty and do not process or propagate data.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of logic, data handling, or suspicious patterns; standard generated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated parser listener with no active logic, external interactions, or embedded code. It contains only method stubs ('pass') for parse tree events, with conditional imports. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code serves as a scaffold for further implementation and does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, safe, and standard boilerplate for a parser listener. It contains no malicious or security-risk elements. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
