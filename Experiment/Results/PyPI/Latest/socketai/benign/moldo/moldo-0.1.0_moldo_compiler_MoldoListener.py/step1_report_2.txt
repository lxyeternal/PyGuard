{
  "purpose": "This code defines a parse tree listener class for a custom language grammar, likely used for parsing or compiling source code written in that language.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statements and the class definition, including method signatures. It does not process user input or external data directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into vulnerable operations, such as system commands, database queries, or network connections.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present; the code primarily sets up a parse tree listener structure with no active processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is generated boilerplate from ANTLR with no implementation logic, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a standard boilerplate parser listener class, generated automatically from a grammar file. It contains method definitions for parse tree events but no executable logic within those methods. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The code simply imports the ANTLR runtime and conditionally imports a parser class, which is typical in generated parser code. Since it contains no data processing or command execution, it presents no security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard boilerplate generated parser code with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a scaffold for further implementation rather than containing active or risky logic.",
