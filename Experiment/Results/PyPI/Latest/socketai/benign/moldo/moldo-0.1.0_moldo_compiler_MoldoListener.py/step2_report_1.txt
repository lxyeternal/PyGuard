  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a boilerplate auto-generated parser listener class from ANTLR for a language called Moldo.\n   - It contains only method stubs (`pass`) for parse tree events, with no logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - The import statements are standard, with conditional import logic based on the module's context.\n   - There are no embedded code snippets that perform system calls, network operations, or data handling.\n   - The code does not read external data, process untrusted inputs, or output data.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Assessment:**\n   - The code is purely structural, meant to be extended for custom logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n   - No external data flows, no command execution, and no interaction with external systems.\n   - The code is consistent with typical auto-generated parser scaffolding.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating the code is not obfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security issues.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is boilerplate generated code with no active logic.\n   - There are no claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities; all assessments are consistent.\n   - The code does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is safe, benign, and standard for parser scaffolding.\n   - No modifications or security concerns are warranted based on the provided code and reports.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the existing scores. The code poses no security risk, malware threat, or obfuscation concern.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a standard, auto-generated parser listener skeleton with no malicious or security issues. It is safe and serves as a foundation for further parser logic implementation.",
