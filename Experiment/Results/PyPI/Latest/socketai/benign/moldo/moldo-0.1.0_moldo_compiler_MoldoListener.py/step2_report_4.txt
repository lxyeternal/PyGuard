  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose**:  \n   The provided code is a boilerplate, auto-generated parser listener class from ANTLR for the Moldo language. It contains no executable logic, only method stubs for parse tree events, and imports necessary modules conditionally.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Elements**:  \n   - No code executes commands, processes data, or interacts with external systems.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is standard generated boilerplate meant for extension.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:  \n   All five reports consistently state that the code is a benign, auto-generated parser listener with no logic, data processing, or external interactions. They confirm the absence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and generated, not obfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, justified because there is no active logic, data handling, or external interactions that could pose a security risk.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:  \n   - Since the code is purely boilerplate, there is no reason to assign any higher risk or malware scores.\n   - The reports seem consistent and reasonable.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   - No signs of sabotage or malicious intent.\n   - The code's purpose is to serve as a scaffold for further implementation, not to perform any operations itself.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0**  \n- **Risk Score**: **0**  \n\nThese scores accurately reflect the code's benign, generated nature.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a standard, auto-generated ANTLR parser listener skeleton with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The reports correctly identify this, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThis supply chain component is safe. It does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or malware risks.",
