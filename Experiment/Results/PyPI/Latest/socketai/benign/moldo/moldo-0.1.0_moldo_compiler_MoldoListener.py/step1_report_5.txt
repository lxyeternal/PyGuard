{
  "purpose": "Define a parse tree listener for a Moldo language parser generated by ANTLR 4.9.2.",
  "sources": "Imports of antlr4 library, conditional import of MoldoParser, class and method definitions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data output, no network or system calls",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code contains only method stubs",
  "anomalies": "Presence of auto-generated comment indicating parser generation, no actual logic or data processing, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward template for a parser listener generated by ANTLR. It imports necessary modules, conditionally imports the parser class, and defines empty listener methods for parse tree events. No data processing, no input/output handling, and no suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present. The structure suggests it's a code template or boilerplate, not an active component executing any logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated parser listener template with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no active logic, no data flows, and does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure.",
