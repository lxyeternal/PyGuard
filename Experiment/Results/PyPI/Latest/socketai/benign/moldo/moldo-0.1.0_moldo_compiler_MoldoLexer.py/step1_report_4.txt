{
  "purpose": "The code defines a lexer for the Moldo language, generated by ANTLR, to tokenize input scripts containing specific tags and identifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a provided stream (likely script files) and processes it through the ANTLR-generated lexer.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the lexer simply tokenizes input without executing or outputting data externally.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the input stream into the lexer, which then generates tokens based on defined rules.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard ANTLR-generated lexer with no unusual code, obfuscated segments, or hardcoded secrets. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward lexer definition for a custom language, generated automatically from a grammar file. It includes token definitions for specific tags and identifiers, with no embedded malicious logic, network operations, or data exfiltration code. The presence of generated code and standard library imports further reduces suspicion. The code is purely declarative and static, serving the purpose of tokenizing input for a parser. There are no signs of supply chain malicious tampering or malicious behavior within this module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign ANTLR-generated lexer for a custom language. It contains no malware, suspicious activities, or security risks. It functions solely as a tokenizer with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
