  "conclusion": "The code contains critical security vulnerabilities due to unsafe dynamic code execution and unvalidated module imports. The high malware and security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified. The code is highly insecure for production use without significant security enhancements such as sandboxing, input validation, and controlled module loading."
