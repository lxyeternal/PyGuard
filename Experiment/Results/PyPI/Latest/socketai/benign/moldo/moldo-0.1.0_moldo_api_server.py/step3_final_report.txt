  "purpose": "Provides FastAPI endpoints for compiling, executing, and managing Moldo code, accepting user input for code and modules, parsing code, and executing dynamically.",
  "sources": "User-supplied code string, user-supplied module paths, function arguments",
  "sinks": "exec() call on parsed code, parser.import_python_module() with user-provided paths",
  "flows": "Code received from user -> parsed by parser.parse() -> executed via exec() in a new namespace; module paths from user -> imported via parser.import_python_module()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on untrusted code, importing modules from user-supplied paths without validation, no sandboxing or input sanitization",
  "analysis": "The code executes user-provided code via exec() without validation, risking arbitrary code execution. It imports modules from user-supplied paths without validation, which can load malicious modules. No sandboxing or security controls are present. The parser functions are used without security context, further increasing risk. These patterns are consistent with high-security vulnerabilities, potentially enabling malicious activity such as code injection, system compromise, or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains critical security vulnerabilities due to unsafe dynamic code execution and unvalidated module imports. The high malware and security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified. The code is highly insecure for production use without significant security enhancements such as sandboxing, input validation, and controlled module loading.",
