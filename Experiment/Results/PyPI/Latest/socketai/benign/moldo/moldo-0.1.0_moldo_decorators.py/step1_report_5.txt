{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator for marking functions as usable within a system called Moldo, encapsulating functions in a class that preserves metadata and allows invocation.",
  "sources": "Reads function objects and their metadata (__name__, __doc__, __module__); no external data sources or input reading identified.",
  "targets": "No sinks that lead to data leaks, system modifications, or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "The decorator wraps a function into a MoldoFunction object, which simply forwards calls; no untrusted data flow or external effect observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining a decorator that encapsulates functions in a class to retain metadata and possibly facilitate registration in a larger system. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The use of standard library modules and conventional patterns suggests normal functionality. No external inputs or sensitive data handling are involved. Overall, the code appears purely for functional decoration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a function registration or tagging system within a larger application context. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign utility module with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
