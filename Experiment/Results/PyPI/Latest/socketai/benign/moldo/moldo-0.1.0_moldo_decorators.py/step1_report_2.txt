{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator and a wrapper class to mark functions as usable within a system called Moldo, enabling optional renaming and metadata preservation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading points are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause data leaks or security effects are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a decorator that wraps functions in a class preserving metadata, intended for marking functions for use in an external system called Moldo. The implementation uses standard Python features such as decorators, classes, and type hints. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code’s purpose aligns with typical utility functions for marking functions with metadata. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for marking functions for use in Moldo, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no hidden malicious behavior.",
