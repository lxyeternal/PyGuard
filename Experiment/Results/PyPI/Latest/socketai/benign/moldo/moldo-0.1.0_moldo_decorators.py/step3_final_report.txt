  "purpose": "A utility decorator and wrapper class for marking functions as usable within the Moldo system, preserving metadata and optionally assigning a reference name.",
  "sources": "Function definitions and decorator application; no external data input or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "Decorator wraps a function, creating a MoldoFunction instance; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class for wrapping functions and a decorator to create such wrappers, primarily for function registration or metadata preservation. No malicious behavior, external data handling, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is clear, standard Python, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or security-sensitive operations. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for function registration within the Moldo system. All reports are accurate, and the security assessment indicates no risks or malicious activity. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
