{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator and a class for wrapping functions, allowing them to be marked and referenced in a system called Moldo.",
  "sources": "Function definitions (__call__ method, decorator function, class constructor)",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling, external data transmission, or sensitive data exposure",
  "flows": "Decorator wrapping functions, with no external or untrusted data flow; no malicious or unusual flows identified",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code appears to be standard function wrapping logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'moldo_function' that wraps functions into 'MoldoFunction' objects, preserving metadata and allowing optional reference naming. No input/output, external data access, or suspicious behavior is present. The implementation is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a function decorator for marking functions for use in a system called Moldo. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
