{
  "purpose": "Defines a decorator and a class to wrap functions for use in a system called Moldo, allowing reference naming.",
  "sources": "Reads function objects and optional reference names during decoration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input function objects flow into the MoldoFunction wrapper, which then can be invoked, but no external data flow or output manipulation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The code is straightforward, primarily defining a decorator and a wrapper class.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a class MoldoFunction that wraps a given function, preserving its attributes and providing a callable interface. The decorator moldo_function creates instances of MoldoFunction with optional reference naming. There are no operations involving external data sources, network activity, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate function referencing and does not introduce any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a utility for function decoration and referencing in a larger system. It does not contain malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks.",
