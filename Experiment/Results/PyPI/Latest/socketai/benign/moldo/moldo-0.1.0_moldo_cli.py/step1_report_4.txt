  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for compiling Moldo language files into Python code and for running a web server for the Moldo API.",
  "sources": "Input files specified via command-line arguments for compilation, environment variables or command-line parameters for server configuration.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations for output Python code, running uvicorn server which could potentially be exposed to network-based input.",
  "flows": "Reading input file -> Parsing and compiling code -> Writing output file or printing -> Starting server via uvicorn -> Handling network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code. Usage of `sys.exit()` is standard. No unusual data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script acts as a command-line tool for compiling code and launching a server. It relies on external modules for parsing and server operation. The code appears straightforward and standard for such tasks. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious logic detected. The server component could be a risk if exposed publicly, but as written, it defaults to localhost binding. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or secret exfiltration present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate functions related to code compilation and server hosting with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It is safe under normal usage. The only consideration is the server, which should be properly secured if exposed externally.",
