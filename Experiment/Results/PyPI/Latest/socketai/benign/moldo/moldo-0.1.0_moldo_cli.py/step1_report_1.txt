  "purpose": "Provides command-line interface for compiling Moldo language files to Python and running a server for the Moldo API.",
  "sources": "Reading input files for compilation, command-line arguments for server configuration.",
  "sinks": "Writing compiled code to files, starting a server process.",
  "flows": "Input files and command-line arguments → functions that process files or start server → output files or server process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines functions for file compilation and server operation. It reads files specified via command-line arguments and writes output files accordingly. The server is started with uvicorn, using parameters provided through arguments, with no hardcoded host/port. There are no embedded or dynamic code execution, network connections beyond server startup, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be straightforward CLI utility code for a language compiler and server deployment, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI tool for compiling Moldo language files and running an API server. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on the provided code. No malware or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
