  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for compiling Moldo files into Python code and running a web server for the Moldo API.",
  "sources": "Reading input Moldo files, reading command-line arguments, environment variables via uvicorn configuration.",
  "sinks": "File writing for compiled code, starting uvicorn server (network binding).",
  "flows": "Input files are read and processed into output files or displayed; server parameters are used to bind and run the web server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious code patterns; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file I/O and server startup. The import statements and functions are standard. No untrusted data flows into dangerous functions. uvicorn is used with parameters provided via command line, which is typical for server apps. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are apparent. No suspicious dependencies or code patterns. Overall, the code appears to be a standard utility and server launcher with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical CLI and server start script with no malicious or suspicious behaviors detected. It functions as intended without security risks in the given scope.",
