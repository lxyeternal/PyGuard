  "purpose": "CLI utility for compiling Moldo language files into Python and launching a local API server.",
  "sources": "Input file specified by user in compile command; command-line arguments for server host, port, reload flag.",
  "sinks": "None directly; server binds to localhost by default, minimizing external exposure.",
  "flows": "Input file read -> parser.parse() -> output written or printed; command-line args -> uvicorn.run() -> server startup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI and server launcher, utilizing external modules (`MoldoParser`, `app`) assumed benign. It reads user input files, processes them, and starts a server with user-defined parameters. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security flaws are evident. The server defaults to localhost, reducing external attack surface. External dependencies are not shown but are presumed safe based on context. The code's structure and behavior align with standard practices for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to server exposure if misconfigured, but defaults are safe. The malware and obfuscated scores are zero, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical concerns with server exposure but no inherent vulnerabilities.",
