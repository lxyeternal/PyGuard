  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, file reads, network connections, dynamic code execution functions (`eval()`, `exec()`), hardcoded URLs/IPs, string manipulations, base64 decoding.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network communications, file writes, dynamic code execution points, potential data exfiltration channels.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input/env variables flow into dynamic execution functions or network connections, potentially leading to malicious payloads or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic `eval()`/`exec()`, hardcoded URLs/IPs, base64 decoding, unusual string manipulations, inconsistent or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical malicious indicators such as obfuscation and dynamic code execution, especially in report 4. Other reports show benign patterns with no suspicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports align with these observations, with high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores justified for report 4. The remaining reports' low scores are appropriate given their descriptions. The overall assessment confirms that only report 4 indicates significant malicious potential, while others are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains a highly obfuscated, dynamically executing script indicative of malicious intent (report 4). Other code snippets are benign, with low security risks. The scoring system accurately reflects these findings, with high suspicion justified for report 4 and low for others.",
