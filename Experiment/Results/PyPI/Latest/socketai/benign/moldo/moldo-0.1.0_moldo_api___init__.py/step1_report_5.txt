  "purpose": "The code appears to perform a data processing or utility function, but the specific purpose cannot be fully determined without additional context.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as reading from environment variables, files, or network sockets are potential data sources. No explicit sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network communication, or data output functions. No clear sinks are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to output or processing functions, but no specific flow paths are identified due to lack of detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are apparent. The code structure appears standard without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "A line-by-line review reveals standard Python functions and no signs of malicious behavior. The absence of network connections, file manipulations, or hidden behaviors suggests normal operation. Lack of context prevents identifying hidden flows, but based on available information, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate any apparent malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. It appears to be legitimate, with no signs of malware, data leaks, or sabotage.",
