{
  "purpose": "To invoke the main function from the mcp_server_deepsearch module, likely to perform a deep search operation as part of the package's functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement from mcp_server_deepsearch and the call to main() function.",
  "sinks": "The main() function within mcp_server_deepsearch; potential untrusted data handling depends on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Import mcp_server_deepsearch -> call main() -> execution flow depends on main() implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies visible in the provided code snippet; very minimal code with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function and executes it directly. There is no input handling, data processing, or network activity visible in this snippet. The behavior entirely depends on the implementation of mcp_server_deepsearch.main(). Without examining that function, no malicious activity can be inferred. The code itself appears straightforward and typical for a script that delegates to a module's main routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple invocation of a main function from an external module. No malicious behavior is evident from this snippet alone. Its security risk and malware potential are very low, assuming the module itself is legitimate and free of malicious payloads.",
