  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code content and behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code simply imports `main` from `mcp_server_deepsearch` and executes it.\n   - The code snippet itself is minimal and does not contain any anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The behavior entirely depends on the implementation of `mcp_server_deepsearch.main()`, which is external and unknown here.\n\n2. **Presence of issues:**\n   - Based solely on the code snippet, there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n   - The reports correctly note that without inspecting the external package, no definitive security conclusions can be made.\n\n3. **Scores and their reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators in the code.\n   - Security risk scores are low (~0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the minimal code and reliance on external code.\n   - Confidence levels vary from 0.3 to 0.8, reflecting the uncertainty due to lack of insight into `mcp_server_deepsearch`.\n\n4. **Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n   - No report suggests that the external package is malicious, but the risk remains if the package itself is compromised.\n   - Since the code is just a delegate to an external module, the main concern is the trustworthiness of that module, not the code snippet itself.\n\n5. **My assessment:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0, since no malicious activity is evident.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n   - **Risk score:** 0.2 seems appropriate, reflecting the reliance on an external package whose behavior is unknown but not inherently malicious.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n- The code is benign in structure.\n- The main risk lies in the external package `mcp_server_deepsearch`. If that package contains malicious code, it would execute upon calling `main()`.\n- Without further inspection of the package, the overall security posture remains uncertain but not suspicious based on this snippet alone.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Verify the integrity and source of `mcp_server_deepsearch`.\n- Perform static or dynamic analysis of `mcp_server_deepsearch.main()` if possible.\n- Consider increasing confidence if the package is well-known and trusted; otherwise, maintain a cautious stance.\n\n**Summary:**\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware         | 0               |\n| Obfuscated      | 0               |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2             |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the logical assessment of the provided code snippets and reports.",
