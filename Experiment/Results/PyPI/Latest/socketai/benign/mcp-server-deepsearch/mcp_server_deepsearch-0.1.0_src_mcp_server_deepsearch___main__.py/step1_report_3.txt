  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main function from the mcp_server_deepsearch module.",
  "sources": "The import statement from mcp_server_deepsearch, and the call to main() function",
  "sinks": "Execution of the main() function from the imported module",
  "flows": "Code flow imports mcp_server_deepsearch, then executes main()",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code complexity; reliance on external module. No apparent hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports and runs a main function from an external module. No additional logic, input handling, or data processing is present. Security analysis depends on the content of mcp_server_deepsearch, which is external; the code itself appears straightforward and standard. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal entry point executing an external module's main function. Without inspection of the external module, no malicious activity can be confirmed from this code alone. The code itself poses no apparent security risk.",
