{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main function from the 'mcp_server_deepsearch' package, likely to run its primary functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from 'mcp_server_deepsearch'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function, which may perform various operations depending on the package's implementation.",
  "flows": "The imported 'main' function is called directly after import, initiating its internal process, potentially involving data processing or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are evident in this minimal snippet. Lack of inline code or explicit behavior makes analysis reliant on external package content.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function 'main' from the 'mcp_server_deepsearch' package and immediately executes it. Without further context or inspection of the package's code, it's unclear what 'main()' does. The minimal code does not include any obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Its behavior entirely depends on the implementation of 'mcp_server_deepsearch'. If this package contains malicious code, it would only execute when 'main()' is called. The code itself does not reveal malicious intent or malicious behavior on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward invocation of an imported function from an external package. On its own, it appears benign; however, the security risk depends on the behavior of the 'mcp_server_deepsearch' package's 'main()' function. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident from this snippet alone.",
