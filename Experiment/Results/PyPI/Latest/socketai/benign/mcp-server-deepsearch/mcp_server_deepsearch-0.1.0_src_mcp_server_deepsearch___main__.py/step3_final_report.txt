{
  "purpose": "Delegates execution to the 'main' function of the external 'mcp_server_deepsearch' module, likely serving as an entry point or orchestrator.",
  "sources": "Import of 'main' from 'mcp_server_deepsearch' module",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' which may invoke internal code with potential side effects",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' -> call to 'main()' function",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function from an external module and immediately executes it. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'mcp_server_deepsearch.main()'. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present within this snippet. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's simplicity. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the external package, which cannot be assessed here. The code itself is benign, but executing 'main()' could be risky if the external module is malicious or compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign delegate to an external module's main function. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident within this snippet. The security risk is low but hinges on the trustworthiness of 'mcp_server_deepsearch'. The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent. To enhance security confidence, review or verify the external package before execution in sensitive environments.",
