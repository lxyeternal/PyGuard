{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'main' function from the 'mcp_server_deepsearch' module and executes it. Its purpose appears to be to run the main process defined in that module.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from mcp_server_deepsearch import main' reads the 'main' function from an external package/module. The call to 'main()' executes this function.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function is invoked directly; any data flows depend on its internal implementation. No direct sinks like network, file, or system commands are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The source (import) leads to execution at 'main()'. Without the internal code of 'main()', flow analysis is limited. If 'main()' processes untrusted data, it could lead to vulnerabilities, but this cannot be assessed here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimalistic and relies on an external package. No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are visible here. The package name 'mcp_server_deepsearch' is somewhat descriptive but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "This code imports and executes a function from an external module. Since no internal logic is shown, the behavior entirely depends on 'mcp_server_deepsearch'. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies in this fragment. The security concerns are primarily related to the behavior of the external package, which cannot be determined from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is minimal and does not exhibit malicious behavior. Its security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'mcp_server_deepsearch'. Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks within this code.",
