{
  "purpose": "A Python script orchestrating web search planning, execution, and report generation for research automation using external APIs and asynchronous tasks.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line arguments (API key), external modules (`agents`, `mcp`, `openai`), and network calls to external APIs.",
  "sinks": "External API calls for web search and OpenAI, network communication via proxy URL, no untrusted data sinks or data exfiltration detected.",
  "flows": "User input (API key) -> API key setting -> search planning via `Runner.run` -> web search execution -> report generation -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors; API key obtained at runtime; external API URL uses a proxy, which warrants trust but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a modular, asynchronous research automation system that interacts with external APIs for web search and report synthesis. It handles API keys securely at runtime, with no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. External dependencies and API interactions are standard for such applications. The code structure and flow are transparent and legitimate. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate research automation tool with no malicious intent or security flaws. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious behaviors. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal external API reliance but no malicious activity.",
