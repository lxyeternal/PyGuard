{
  "purpose": "The code implements an AI-driven research assistant system that performs web searches, summarizes results, and generates detailed reports, primarily for research purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'query' from user, and external OpenAI API key provided via command-line argument.",
  "sinks": "Potential data transmission to external OpenAI API endpoint; the 'deepresearch' MCP server outputs the final report.",
  "flows": "User inputs 'query' -> '_plan_searches' sends query to 'Runner.run' with 'planner_agent' -> '_perform_searches' executes multiple '_search' tasks fetching search results -> '_write_report' compiles search results into report -> final report returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes no hardcoded credentials or secrets beyond the API key provided at runtime; the API key is passed securely via command-line argument. External network communications are directed to a specified proxy endpoint, which may warrant further validation. The code does not perform any malicious activities like data exfiltration or system modifications. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a modular research assistant tool utilizing asyncio for concurrency, with well-defined source-to-sink data flows involving user input, web search execution, and report generation. It uses standard libraries and third-party packages without evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. External API interactions are for legitimate AI tasks; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activities are evident. The code's overall structure and logic are straightforward, focusing on research workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate AI-powered research assistant system with no detectable malicious behavior. It relies on runtime-provided API keys and communicates with external APIs for AI processing. No malicious or suspicious elements are found. The overall security risk is low, assuming proper API key management and trusted network endpoints.",
