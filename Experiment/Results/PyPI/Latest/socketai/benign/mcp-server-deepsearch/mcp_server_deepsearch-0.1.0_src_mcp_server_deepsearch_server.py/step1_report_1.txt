{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform automated web searches, generate research reports, and interact with OpenAI's API to assist in research tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads user input for queries, API keys from command-line arguments, and web search instructions embedded in code.",
  "sinks": "Uses the OpenAI API with provided API key, outputs research reports, and performs web searches via specified tools.",
  "flows": "User inputs query -> _plan_searches generates search plan -> _perform_searches executes searches -> _write_report compiles results -> deepresearch returns report.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; API key is passed via command-line argument, which is typical; no suspicious code behaviors or obfuscated code detected; functions and data flows appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a multi-step research assistant system with clear modular components for planning, searching, and reporting. It interacts with external services such as OpenAI and web search tools using well-defined APIs. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. The API key is obtained from user input at runtime, reducing the risk of hardcoded secrets. No obfuscated or suspicious language features are present. The system's behavior aligns with legitimate research automation functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate research automation tool with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It interacts with external APIs responsibly, with no suspicious data handling or hidden behaviors.",
