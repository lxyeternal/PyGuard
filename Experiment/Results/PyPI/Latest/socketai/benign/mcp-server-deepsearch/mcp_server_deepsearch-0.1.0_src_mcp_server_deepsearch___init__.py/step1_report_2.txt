  "purpose": "The code imports the 'main' function or object from a local module named 'server'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from a local module; no external data input observed.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths observable in this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a 'main' component from a relative module 'server'. It does not include any data processing, user input handling, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this minimal snippet. The code appears to be part of a larger application where 'server' might contain server logic, but based solely on this fragment, no malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a basic import statement with no suspicious or malicious elements. It does not introduce any security risks or malicious behavior by itself.",
