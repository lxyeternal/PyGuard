  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** The report correctly states that this is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Sound; no anomalies or suspicious activity are present.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** Same as above; it's just an import statement with no evident malicious activity.  \n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correct; no anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower (0.9), but still high.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** Again, just an import statement, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Consistent; no anomalies or suspicious constructs.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 — this is very low, but the report assigns a small security risk.  \n- **Risk Score Justification:** Given that it's just an import, a security risk of 0.1 seems marginally high unless there's context suggesting otherwise.  \n- **Malware Score:** Correctly 0, as no malicious activity is evident.  \n- **Conclusion:** The securityRisk score could be lowered to 0, as there's no evidence of risk in this snippet.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** Same as above; minimal import statement with no malicious signs.  \n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Appropriate; no anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 — again, very low, but perhaps slightly overestimating risk.  \n- **Conclusion:** The securityRisk score should be adjusted to 0, reflecting the absence of any security concern.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** Same as others; a straightforward import with no malicious activity.  \n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correct; no anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are correctly 0.\n- The securityRisk scores are mostly 0, except in reports 3 and 4, where they are set to 0.1. Given the simplicity of the code, these should be lowered to 0.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Adjust the securityRisk scores for reports 3 and 4 from 0.1 to 0** to better reflect the absence of risk.\n- **Overall malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at 0.**\n\n### Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence that the code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious or suspicious activity.",
