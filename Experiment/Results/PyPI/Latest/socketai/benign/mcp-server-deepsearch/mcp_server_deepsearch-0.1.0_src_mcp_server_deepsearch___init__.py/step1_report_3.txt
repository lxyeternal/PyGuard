  "purpose": "Imports the 'main' function from a local module named 'server'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads code from a local module; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable within this minimal code snippet; no execution or data transfer occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, consisting solely of an import statement, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module, which is a common practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The snippet alone does not invoke or execute the imported function, so no further malicious activity can be inferred. There are no anomalies or suspicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It appears to be a standard import of a local module's function.",
