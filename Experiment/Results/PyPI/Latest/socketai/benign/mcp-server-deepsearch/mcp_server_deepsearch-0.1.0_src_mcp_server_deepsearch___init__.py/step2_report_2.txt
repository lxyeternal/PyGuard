  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is just `from .server import main`, which is a standard import statement. No data flow, no execution, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence is 1, malware is 0, securityRisk is 0 — all reasonable. No changes needed.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal import statement, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, securityRisk 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, straightforward import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1 — the securityRisk is slightly above zero but still very low, reflecting minimal concern. This seems reasonable given the snippet.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal import, no data flow or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1 — acceptable.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as others, simple import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, malware 0, securityRisk 0 — consistent.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a basic import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- The scores assigned are consistent with the minimal, benign nature of the code snippets.  \n- The slight securityRisk scores (0.1) in some reports seem to be a conservative acknowledgment that, in a broader context, imports could potentially be misused, but in this isolated snippet, there's no actual risk.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate. No signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and lack of malicious indicators, I would assign a **risk score of 0** for all snippets, unless further context suggests otherwise.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and well-reasoned. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects that the code is benign and typical for Python projects.",
