  "purpose": "Import the 'main' function or object from the 'server' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "The code imports data from a local module named 'server'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are observable.",
  "analysis": "This code simply performs a relative import from a module named 'server'. There are no input sources, data processing, or potential sinks in this snippet. Given its simplicity, it cannot be evaluated for malicious behavior in isolation. It appears to be part of a larger codebase where 'main' might be invoked elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks within this isolated snippet.",
