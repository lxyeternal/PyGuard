{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'main' function or object from the 'server' module in the current package, likely to initialize or run server-related functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package's 'server' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'main' but does not execute or utilize it within this fragment; no data flow is observable.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs. The import statement alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement that references a 'main' element from a local 'server' module. Without further context or execution, there is no indication of malicious behavior. The code appears to be part of a larger application responsible for server operations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious indicators are present. Since only an import statement is provided, the security assessment cannot find any malicious activity or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward import statement typical in modular Python applications.",
