  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project named 'pxtool'. It reads README.md with UTF-8 encoding and configures package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file from local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.md' and passes static data to setup(), with no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward 'setup.py' script using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file with UTF-8 encoding and invokes setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or obfuscated elements. All security signals are absent, and the code adheres to standard packaging practices. Multiple expert reviews confirm the benign nature, with consistent conclusions and appropriate scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
