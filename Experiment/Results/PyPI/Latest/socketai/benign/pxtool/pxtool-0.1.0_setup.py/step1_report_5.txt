  "flows": "Read 'README.md' content into 'long_description' variable, then used in setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code. Use of standard setuptools setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup process, importing setuptools, reading a README file with utf-8 encoding, and configuring package metadata and dependencies. No obfuscated code, suspicious code patterns, or malicious behaviors are present. The dependencies are straightforward, and there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code does not perform any network operations, execute dynamic code, or handle sensitive information beyond standard package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
