  "purpose": "Defines a configuration data structure with settings, processors, and a dictionary config for logging setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, structlog.types, and local Settings class; class definition and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class definition with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, static data container with clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a NamedTuple 'Config' with three fields: settings, processors, and dict_config. It serves as a static configuration holder with no dynamic behavior, data processing, or external input handling. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose. The reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration data structure with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
