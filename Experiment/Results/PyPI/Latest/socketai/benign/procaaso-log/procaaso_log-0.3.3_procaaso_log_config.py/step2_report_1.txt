  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reported issues, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict, Any, NamedTuple, Tuple\nfrom structlog.types import Processor\nfrom procaaso_log.settings import Settings\n\nclass Config(NamedTuple):\n    settings: Settings\n    processors: Tuple[Processor, ...]\n    dict_config: Dict[str, Any]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Issue Presence Confirmation**\n- The code is a straightforward class definition with type annotations.\n- No dynamic code, no data processing, no input/output operations.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe issues claimed (or not claimed) in reports are **not present** in the code.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic or Reasoning**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a simple configuration container.\n- No errors or flaws in their reasoning; they correctly interpret the code's purpose and structure.\n- They uniformly conclude the code is benign and lacks security concerns.\n\n**No issues here.**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue & Justification**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n- These scores are **reasonable** given the code's nature.\n\n**No adjustments needed.**\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**\n- The **risk score** is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate because:\n  - The code is static, does not execute any untrusted data.\n  - No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.\n- The **malware score** is 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n**If any report suggested otherwise, I would challenge it, but they are consistent here.**\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Claims Based on Assumptions or Potential Vulnerabilities**\n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as purely structural.\n- No false positives or speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Overall Consistency and Final Assessment**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The code does not perform any operations, data handling, or dynamic behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Evaluation & My Own Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, static data structure definition with no signs of security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0            | No malicious code, behavior, or indicators present.        |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.           |\n| Security Risk  | 0            | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or risky operations.       |\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.**",
