  "purpose": "Define a configuration data structure with settings, processors, and dictionary configuration",
  "sources": "Import statements for typing, structlog, and project-specific settings",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no runtime data flows; only class definition",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, then defines a NamedTuple 'Config' with three fields: settings, processors, and dict_config. The imported modules are typical for configuration management. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. The code appears to serve as a simple data container. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration data structure with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not perform any operations or data handling that could lead to security issues.",
