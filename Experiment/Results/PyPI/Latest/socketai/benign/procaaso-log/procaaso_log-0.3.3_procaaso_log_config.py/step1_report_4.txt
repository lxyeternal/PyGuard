{
  "purpose": "Define a configuration data structure using NamedTuple for application settings and processing pipeline.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, structlog, and procaaso_log.settings; no external input reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code solely defines a data container.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward data structure declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type annotations and a custom Settings class. It defines a NamedTuple 'Config' with three fields: settings (likely containing sensitive configuration), processors (a tuple of processing functions), and dict_config (a dictionary for additional configuration). There are no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or external data processing. The code is a simple data container, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign configuration data structure with no malicious intent or security risks.",
