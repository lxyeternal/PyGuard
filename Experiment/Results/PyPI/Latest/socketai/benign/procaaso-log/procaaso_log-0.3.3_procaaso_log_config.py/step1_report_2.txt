  "purpose": "Define a configuration data structure for application settings, processors, and dictionary configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing', 'structlog.types', and 'procaaso_log.settings'; class definition using these modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; primarily static type annotations and class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is straightforward and appears to serve configuration purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing modules and a specific 'Processor' type from 'structlog.types'. It then imports 'Settings' from a local module. Defines a NamedTuple 'Config' with three fields: 'settings' of type 'Settings', 'processors' as a tuple of 'Processor', and 'dict_config' as a dictionary of string keys to any values. There are no operations, data manipulations, or dynamic executions that could indicate malicious behavior. The structure is typical for configuration setup in Python applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign configuration data structure with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
