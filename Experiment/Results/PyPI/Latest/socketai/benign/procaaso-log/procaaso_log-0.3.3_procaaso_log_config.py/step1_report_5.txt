  "purpose": "Define a configuration data structure for application settings, processors, and configuration dictionary.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply declares a data structure without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type annotations and a Settings class, then defines a NamedTuple named Config with three fields: settings, processors, and dict_config. All fields are standard type annotations without dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing. No malicious or unusual constructs are present. The structure appears to be a straightforward configuration container for application settings.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign data structure definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
