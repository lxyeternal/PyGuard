  "purpose": "Define a configuration data structure for application settings and processing pipeline",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (`typing`, `structlog.types`, `procaaso_log.settings`)",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines data structures",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, then defines a NamedTuple 'Config' with three fields: 'settings' of type 'Settings', 'processors' as a tuple of 'Processor' objects, and 'dict_config' as a dictionary. There is no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, and no suspicious logic or side effects. The purpose appears to be static configuration setup, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data structure definition for configuration purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
