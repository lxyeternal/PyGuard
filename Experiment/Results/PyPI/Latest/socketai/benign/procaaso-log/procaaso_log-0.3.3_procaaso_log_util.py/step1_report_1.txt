{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to recursively merge configuration objects, primarily dictionaries, lists, and primitives, into a single configuration object.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'source', 'patch', and 'configs' (via *configs) as input data sources.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or external outputs; data is merged internally without external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data from function parameters flows through 'patch_merge' recursive calls, resulting in a merged configuration object returned by 'merge_dict_configs'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. The use of 'set' to merge lists could lead to unordered data, but it's a benign operation. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard recursive merging of dictionaries and lists, handling primitive types by overwriting and combining list items using set union. The use of 'try-except' captures exceptions during merging, raising detailed NotImplementedError messages. There are no external data communications, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. The functions serve a typical configuration merging purpose without suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of recursive merging functions for configuration objects. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
