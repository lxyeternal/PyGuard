{
  "purpose": "Recursively merges two configuration objects, handling dicts, lists, and primitives.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'source' and 'patch' during merge operations, including dictionary keys and list elements.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network communication; in-memory data manipulation only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'patch' into 'source' through recursive merging, affecting nested dicts and lists.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'set' union to merge lists, which can cause data loss or reordering; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard recursive merging of dicts and lists, with error handling for incompatible types. The use of 'set' for list merging may lead to data loss or unordered data but is not malicious. No external communication, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and readable, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The main concern is the potential unintended data alteration due to list merging strategy, not security or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard recursive merge utility with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor risk pertains to data integrity issues caused by list merging via 'set', which is an implementation concern rather than a security threat.",
