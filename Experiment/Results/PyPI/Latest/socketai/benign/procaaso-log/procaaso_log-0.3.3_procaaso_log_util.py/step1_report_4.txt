{
  "purpose": "Recursively merges multiple configuration objects into one combined configuration dictionary.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'source', 'patch', and elements within 'configs' passed to 'merge_dict_configs'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; the code does not send data over network, write to files, or handle sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Inputs (configs) are merged via 'patch_merge' into a single dict; no untrusted external data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a recursive merge utility for Python data structures, handling lists, dicts, and primitives. It raises exceptions when incompatible types are merged. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward, and the exception handling is limited to error messaging. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard recursive merge utility for configuration objects, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to combine data structures safely.",
