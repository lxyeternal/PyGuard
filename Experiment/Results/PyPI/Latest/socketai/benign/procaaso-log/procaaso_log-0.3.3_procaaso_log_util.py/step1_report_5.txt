{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to recursively merge multiple configuration dictionaries or objects into a single unified configuration.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'source' and 'patch' in 'patch_merge', and the 'configs' arguments in 'merge_dict_configs'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, file systems, or network; it only manipulates in-memory data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input objects ('source', 'patch') through recursive merging logic, ultimately returning a merged object; no external data leaks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The merge logic is standard for deep merging data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs recursive merging of data structures (dicts and lists), handling different primitive types appropriately. The merging involves set union for lists and recursive dict merging. No external system calls, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code is well-structured and typical for configuration merging routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for recursively merging configuration objects. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
