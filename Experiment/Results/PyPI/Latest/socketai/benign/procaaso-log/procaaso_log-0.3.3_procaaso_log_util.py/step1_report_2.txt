{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to recursively merge configuration objects, specifically dictionaries, lists, and primitive types.",
  "sources": "The functions read the source objects, patch objects, and their nested data structures.",
  "sinks": "The code writes merged data into source objects, which could potentially modify input data structures.",
  "flows": "Source data (source and patch) are recursively merged into the source object, updating it in place.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious data flows are present. The use of set union on lists may lead to data loss or unintended merging behavior but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a recursive merge of dictionaries, lists, and primitive types. It handles various data types and raises errors for incompatible merges. No network access, system commands, or external interactions are present. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. It simply manipulates data structures. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. The use of set union on lists could lead to unexpected data merging but is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard recursive data merging utility without malicious intent. It performs safe data manipulation and error handling. There are no signs of malware or malicious behaviors. The primary concern is potential data loss or unintended merging behavior, but this does not constitute malicious activity.",
