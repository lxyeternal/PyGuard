  "purpose": "Define a custom Logger class extending structlog's BoundLogger with additional methods for binding, unbinding, and creating new loggers; provide a function to instantiate this custom logger.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class method definitions, get_logger function.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow indicating malicious intent; standard usage of structlog.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. All methods perform standard logging operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom logger class that extends structlog's BoundLogger with methods for managing context (bind, unbind, try_unbind, new). The get_logger function creates instances of this custom logger using structlog's get_logger. All functions and methods perform typical logging setup and context management without any suspicious or malicious operations. No data is transmitted externally, no hardcoded credentials, and no malicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard custom logger implementation using structlog, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
