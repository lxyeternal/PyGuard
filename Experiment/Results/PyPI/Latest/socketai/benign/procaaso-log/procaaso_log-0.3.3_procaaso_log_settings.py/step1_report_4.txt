  "purpose": "Define configuration settings for logging, including environment-specific defaults and validation logic.",
  "sources": "Values from environment variables (via BaseSettings), class attributes, and validator functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially affects logging behavior, but does not write to external systems or handle sensitive data directly.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> BaseSettings parsing -> validators -> final settings object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of validators for environment-specific constraints is standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class with environment-aware defaults and validation. 'auto_format' and 'auto_output' functions set defaults based on the environment. Validators enforce that in production, 'format' is JSON and 'output' is stdout, which are reasonable constraints. No external data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior identified. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are present. The code appears to be straightforward configuration logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup with environment-specific defaults and validation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for configuring logging behavior based on environment variables.",
