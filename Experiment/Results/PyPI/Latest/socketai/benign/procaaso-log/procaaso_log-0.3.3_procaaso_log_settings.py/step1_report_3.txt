  "purpose": "Define and validate logging configuration settings using environment variables and data validation rules.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (prefixed with 'procaaso_log_') for 'env', 'level', 'output', 'format', 'root', and 'root_level'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted environment variable inputs that influence logging configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Settings fields -> Validators (valid_env_format, valid_env_output) -> Final configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Usage of standard validation patterns. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments. No network activity or file manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration classes using Pydantic for logging setup, with environment-specific validation rules. The functions auto_format and auto_output dynamically determine defaults based on environment. Validators enforce rules such as 'format' being JSON in production and 'output' being stdout in production. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious code structures are present. The code strictly handles configuration validation with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup for logging with environment-based validation. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It operates solely on environment variables to enforce consistent logging configurations.",
