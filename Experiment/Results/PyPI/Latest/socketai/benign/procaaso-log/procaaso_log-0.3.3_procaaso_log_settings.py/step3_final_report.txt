  "purpose": "Configuration validation for logging settings based on environment variables, enforcing environment-specific constraints via validators.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed through pydantic's BaseSettings, specifically 'env', 'format', and 'output'.",
  "sinks": "Validators enforce constraints that could prevent misconfiguration but do not lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (sources) influence the 'format' and 'output' settings, which are validated to ensure correctness in production environments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. Functions set defaults based on environment, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup using pydantic, with environment-dependent defaults and validation to enforce correct settings in production. No external network, file, or sensitive data handling occurs. Validators simply enforce that in production, 'format' is JSON and 'output' is stdout. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code is well-structured, clear, and adheres to best practices for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration module with environment-aware validation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal configuration risk. The reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
