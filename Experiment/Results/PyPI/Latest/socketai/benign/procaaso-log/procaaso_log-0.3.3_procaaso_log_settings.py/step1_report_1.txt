  "purpose": "Define and validate logging configuration settings based on environment variables using Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables prefixed with 'procaaso_log_' to set configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data leaks or untrusted data outputs identified.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Pydantic settings -> Validator functions -> Final validated configuration values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code primarily handles configuration validation with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code uses Pydantic's BaseSettings to load environment variables with a specific prefix. It defines functions for automatic determination of output and format based on environment. Validators enforce that in production, the format must be JSON and output must be stdout, which are standard security practices. No untrusted data is directly used in dangerous operations. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be straightforward configuration management code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard configuration validation logic for logging settings. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, nor does it introduce significant security risks. The code enforces environment-specific constraints effectively without suspicious or malicious constructs.",
