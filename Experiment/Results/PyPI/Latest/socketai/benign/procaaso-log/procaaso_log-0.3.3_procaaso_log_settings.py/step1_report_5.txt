  "purpose": "Define and validate logging configuration settings for different environments using Pydantic models and validators.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('env', 'format', 'output') for configuration.",
  "kills": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present; no insecure data handling identified.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence validation logic, but data flow remains within controlled configuration validation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of validators to enforce environment-specific rules; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a configuration class for logging, with environment-based defaults and validation rules. Validators enforce that in production, format is JSON and output is stdout, based on environment settings. No external or untrusted data sinks, malicious code, or suspicious patterns detected. Usage of environment variables and settings appears standard and controlled. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup with environment-specific validation rules. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
