  "purpose": "Configure structlog logging with custom processors and logger class",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'processors' and '**kwargs' used to customize configuration",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sinks or external communications",
  "flows": "Processors and kwargs flow into the '_configure' function, configuring structlog",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected; usage of standard libraries",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'configure' function that sets up structlog with optional custom processors. It ensures default processors are included unless overridden. The configuration is passed to the '_configure' function from structlog. No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard libraries and practices for setting up logging. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration helper for structlog, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
