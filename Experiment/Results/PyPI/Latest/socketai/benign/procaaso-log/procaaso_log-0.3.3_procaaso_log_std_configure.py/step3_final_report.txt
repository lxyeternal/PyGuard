  "purpose": "Configure structlog logging with optional custom processors and a custom logger class.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'processors' and '**kwargs' used to build configuration; import statements for structlog and custom Logger.",
  "sinks": "Calling '_configure' applies configuration in-memory; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Processors and kwargs flow into 'config_kwargs', which is passed to '_configure' to set up logging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The custom Logger import warrants a review but appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward logging setup function that constructs a configuration dictionary with default processors and options, then applies it via structlog's '_configure'. No external data access, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The code is clear, uses standard libraries, and the custom Logger is imported but not shown to be malicious. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No further action is necessary unless the implementation of 'procaaso_log.logger.Logger' is inspected and found to be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe logging configuration helper with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. The malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores should remain at 0.",
