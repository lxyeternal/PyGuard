  "purpose": "Configure structlog logging with optional custom processors and a custom Logger class.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'processors' and '**kwargs', imported modules, and class/method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink for untrusted data; no external data output or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> configuration dictionary -> _configure function call",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and standard for logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'configure' function that sets up structlog with customizable processors and default configurations. It imports standard modules and a custom Logger class. The function constructs a configuration dictionary and invokes '_configure' with it. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a standard logging setup with no malicious behavior or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical configuration for structlog logging, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses safe, standard practices for setting up logging in Python projects.",
