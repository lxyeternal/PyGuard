  "purpose": "Configure structlog logging with optional custom processors and a custom Logger class.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'processors' and '**kwargs'. No external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or external data outputs are present; the code only sets up logging configuration.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'processors' list and 'kwargs'; these are used to call '_configure' with structured config.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code is straightforward and uses standard library calls.",
  "analysis": "The function sets default logging processors, includes optional custom processors, and configures structlog with standard settings and a custom Logger class. All parts are typical for logging setup, with no evidence of malicious behavior or suspicious activities. There are no external data reads, no dangerous code injection points, or suspicious network interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging configuration function with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It solely sets up logging parameters using structlog and a custom logger, with no security risks apparent.",
