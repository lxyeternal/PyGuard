  "purpose": "Defines configuration enums for logging levels, environment types, formats, and modes, primarily for use in logging and application configuration.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static enum definitions with internal references to the logging module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; purely static configuration.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code is static and does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Accesses the private attribute 'logging._nameToLevel', which is unconventional and fragile but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static enum classes for logging levels, environment identifiers, formats, and modes. The 'Level' enum maps string level names to their numeric values using 'logging.getLevelName()' and directly accesses a private attribute '_nameToLevel'. This private attribute usage is unusual and could cause stability issues if the internal logging API changes, but it does not introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The rest of the code is straightforward, with no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The malware score is zero, as there is no malicious intent. The security risk score is minimal (~0.1) due to reliance on a private API, which could affect maintainability but not security. The code is transparent, well-structured, and safe for use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static configuration with no malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the use of a private attribute '_nameToLevel' from the logging module, which could cause stability issues but does not pose a security threat. The overall security risk is very low, and the code is suitable for production use.",
