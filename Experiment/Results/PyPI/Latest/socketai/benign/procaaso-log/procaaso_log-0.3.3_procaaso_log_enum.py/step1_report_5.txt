  "purpose": "Define enumerations for logging levels, environments, formats, and modes used in a Python application.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and constants, no input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "None; no data outputs or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data propagation present in this static code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of logging levels and environment variables appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Enum classes with string representations for different configuration options such as log levels, environments, formats, and modes. It uses standard Python modules and constructs. The 'Level' enum aliases 'FATAL' to 'CRITICAL' with a descriptive note, and includes properties for converting enum values to integers and lowercase strings. No input/output, network operations, or data handling is present. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward and safe set of enumerations for application configuration. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are identified.",
