  "purpose": "Define enumerations for logging levels, environment types, formatting options, and modes, to be used in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "None; the code defines static enums and properties without external data input.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code contains static enum definitions and property methods only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard Enum class and logging module features appropriately. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Enum classes with string values representing configurations and modes. The 'Level' enum dynamically maps logging level names to their numeric values using internal logging functions, which is a common pattern. The 'Env', 'Format', and 'Mode' enums contain static string options for configuration purposes. No external input sources, sinks, or data flows are present. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of configuration enums with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a static configuration utility within a larger codebase.",
