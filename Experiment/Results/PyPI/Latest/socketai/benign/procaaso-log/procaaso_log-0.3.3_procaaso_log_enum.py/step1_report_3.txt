  "purpose": "Defines enumerations for logging levels, environment types, formats, and modes used in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static enumeration values",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static code",
  "anomalies": "None detected; use of logging level name mappings and enum definitions are standard practices",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Python enum classes for various configuration parameters. The 'Level' enum maps logging level names to their numeric values using the 'logging' module, with properties to retrieve integer and string representations. Other enums define environment types, output formats, and operational modes. No input/output handling, external data processing, or dynamic code execution present. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of configuration enums without any malicious or suspicious elements. It appears to be part of a larger, normal application codebase, providing structured constants for configuration.",
