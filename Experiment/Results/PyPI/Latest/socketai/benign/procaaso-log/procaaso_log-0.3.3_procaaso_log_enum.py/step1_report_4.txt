{
  "purpose": "Defines enumerations for log levels, environment types, formatting options, and operational modes for a logging or configuration system.",
  "sources": "No input data sources are read; the code only defines enums and properties.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs are present; no untrusted data handling or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code solely defines constants and properties.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal logging module's private attribute '_nameToLevel' in the 'int' property is unusual and may indicate potential instability or reliance on non-public APIs, but it does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several enumeration classes for configuration purposes, mapping string names to values and vice versa. The 'Level' enum uses 'logging' module functions and accesses a private attribute '_nameToLevel', which is uncommon and may be fragile but is not inherently malicious. No input handling, data transmission, or external code execution features are present. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of configuration enums without malicious intent. The only noteworthy point is the use of a private attribute from the 'logging' module, which does not pose a security risk but could affect stability. Overall, it appears benign.",
