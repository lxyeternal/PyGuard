{
  "purpose": "Defines enumerations for logging levels, environment types, formatting options, and modes to standardize configurations.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; enums are static definitions. No data reading or input processing present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no data or untrusted input handling, no output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static enum definitions with property methods only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; straightforward enum definitions. The use of logging level name mappings is standard. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides enum classes to represent various configuration options. The Level enum maps logging level names to their numeric levels and offers properties to retrieve these levels and string representations. The Env, Format, and Mode enums are simple string enums for configuration states. No input handling, network communication, or executable code exists. The property methods in Level are standard and safe. Overall, the code appears to be a typical configuration module with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious configuration setup with no security risks detected. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or suspicious activities.",
