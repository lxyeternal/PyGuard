  "purpose": "Expose configuration objects imported from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .config module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flow",
  "flows": "Import from .config to module namespace, then export via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports two configuration objects from a local module and exposes them via __all__, a standard Python pattern. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external data handling is present. The code is minimal, clear, and free of malicious or security-compromising constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as 0 with high confidence. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected or inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module pattern with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. All assessments are consistent and accurate.",
