  "purpose": "The code exports specific configuration objects from a local module for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from a local module named 'config'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, as it only imports and defines export variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module to the module's namespace, then to other modules via exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two objects from a relative module named 'config' and explicitly exports them via __all__, which is a common pattern for controlling namespace exports. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior is present. The code is straightforward and does not contain any dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import and export setup with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be a standard configuration file for Python packages.",
