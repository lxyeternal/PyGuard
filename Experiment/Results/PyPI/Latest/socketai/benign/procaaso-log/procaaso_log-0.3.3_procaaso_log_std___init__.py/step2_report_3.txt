  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward import and export pattern, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code simply imports two configuration objects from a local module and exposes them via `__all__`.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, minimal, and standard. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.  \n   \n   These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for any high risk scores:**  \n   Since all reports assign zero to malware and security risk, there's no need to justify higher scores.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard module export pattern with no security concerns.**",
