  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores are appropriate.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward module that imports two configuration objects from a local 'config' module and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The code does not process, handle, or output any untrusted data, nor does it perform any dynamic execution or external data flows.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is syntactically correct.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent or security flaws.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are apparent.\n   - The report's reasoning that this is a standard module export is correct.\n   - The code's simplicity means there are no hidden issues.\n\n3. **Scores Assessment:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, which is correct.\n   - The `securityRisk` score is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - The `confidence` scores are high (1 or 1.0), appropriate given the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No reason exists to assign a higher risk score; the code is clearly benign.\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - Correctly assigned as 0 across all reports, since no malicious activity is evident.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard and benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, harmless module export pattern with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No modifications are necessary. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
