  "purpose": "This code imports specific configuration objects from a local module and defines the public API for the module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.config'",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply imports and exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of two configuration objects from a sibling module and defines the module's public interface via __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is minimal and typical for Python modules, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple module export. No malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
