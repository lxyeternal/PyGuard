  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and considering the overall security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward import and export pattern.\n- The code is minimal, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external data flows.\n- No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The code's purpose is clearly to expose configuration objects from a local module.\n\n**Confirmation of issues:**\n- The code as provided does not contain any errors, flaws, or malicious behavior.\n- The import statement and the __all__ declaration are standard Python idioms for module exports.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks is present.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The securityRisk scores are all 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n- Confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty based on the simplicity and clarity.\n\n**Potential points of concern:**\n- Since the code only imports and exports configuration objects, the primary risk would be if the imported 'config' module were malicious or compromised. However, the reports focus solely on this snippet, and there's no indication that the 'config' module itself is malicious.\n- No assumptions about the contents of 'config' are made; the code does not process or handle data dynamically.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications to scores or reasoning are necessary.\n- The code is a standard pattern with no security concerns.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n**Final note:**\n- If the 'config' module were malicious, that could introduce risks, but based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence of that.\n- The code is benign and typical for module configuration management.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, transparent module that imports configuration objects and exposes them. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.",
