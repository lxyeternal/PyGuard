  "purpose": "The code exports specific configuration objects from the current module for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.config' to access 'standard_dict_config' and 'standard_config'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import source to module's namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports two configuration objects from a local module and explicitly defines them as exportable symbols. There is no indication of malicious behavior, external data manipulation, or security issues. The structure and content are typical for Python package __init__.py files or module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple export of configuration variables with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
