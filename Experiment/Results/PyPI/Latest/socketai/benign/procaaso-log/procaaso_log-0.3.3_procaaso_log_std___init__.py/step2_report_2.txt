  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\nThe code is a minimal Python module that imports two configuration objects from a local 'config' module and explicitly exports them via the `__all__` variable. There are no dynamic behaviors, no external data flows, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious activity. The code pattern is standard for Python package initialization or configuration exposure.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is straightforward and benign.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors, flaws, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Report accuracy:** All reports correctly identify the code as a simple, benign import/export pattern with no security concerns.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or 1 with high confidence, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior or intent detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:\n- The reports assume the imported 'config' module is safe, which is reasonable given the context.\n- No assumptions about external data or dynamic code execution are made or necessary.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard module export pattern with no suspicious or malicious elements. The consistent reports and analysis support this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The scores should remain at zero across all categories, reflecting the absence of risks.",
