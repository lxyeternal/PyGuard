  "purpose": "This code exports specific configuration objects from a local module for use elsewhere in the application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '.config' that provides configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data output or external actions are performed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module into the current namespace, then out via __all__ for module exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and consists solely of import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two configuration objects from a local module named 'config'. It then defines '__all__' to specify which identifiers are exported when the module is imported elsewhere. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or potential malicious constructs. The simplicity and clarity of this snippet suggest it performs standard module configuration tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module export setup for configuration objects. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
