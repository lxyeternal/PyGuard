{
  "purpose": "The code exports configuration objects 'standard_dict_config' and 'standard_config' for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports 'standard_dict_config' and 'standard_config' from a local 'config' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; code only defines exports.",
  "flows": "Imports from 'config' to exports, with no further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with straightforward import and export; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports two objects from a relative 'config' module and exposes them via '__all__'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present. The module appears to be a standard part of a larger project, serving as an interface for configuration data.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import and export of configuration objects with no malicious or security concerns identified.",
