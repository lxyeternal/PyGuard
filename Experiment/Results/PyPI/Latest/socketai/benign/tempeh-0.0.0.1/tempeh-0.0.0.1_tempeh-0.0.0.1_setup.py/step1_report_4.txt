  "purpose": "To define the metadata and configuration for packaging a Python project named 'tempeh'.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function call, which reads static string literals for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all code is standard for a setup script with placeholder values.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with static, mostly placeholder metadata fields such as empty author and author_email. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or suspicious behaviors. The package description indicates it is a security placeholder, and all classifiers are standard. No signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward package setup configuration with placeholder metadata. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
