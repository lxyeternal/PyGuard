  "purpose": "Define a placeholder Python package named 'tempeh' using setuptools",
  "sources": "Input sources are none; static code with no external data read or input handling",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there are no data inputs or untrusted outputs",
  "anomalies": "Author and author_email fields are empty, which is unusual but not malicious; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with minimal metadata, indicating a basic package setup. No input handling, external data fetching, or dynamic code execution is present. The empty author fields are atypical but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple package setup script with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be a placeholder or minimal package definition.",
