  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution of the 'tempeh' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data for package metadata (name, version, author, description, classifiers). No external input or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; the code does not process or output any data that could lead to leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely declarative configuration for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward setup configuration with no unusual or suspicious elements. The author and author_email fields are empty but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata. All data is static and predefined, with no user input or external data dependencies. The package description suggests a placeholder purpose. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves purely to define package metadata for distribution.",
