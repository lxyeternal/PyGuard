  "conclusion": "The code is a highly obfuscated encryption utility with no active malicious intent. Its complexity is typical for cryptographic routines and does not indicate supply chain sabotage or malware. The appropriate assessment is a malware score of 0, an obfuscation score around 0.8, and a low security risk (~0.2). All reports overestimate malicious potential; the primary concern is obfuscation, not malware."
