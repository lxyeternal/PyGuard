  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for various encryption functions of the CthulhuCrypt toolkit.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments (text, table-id, iterations).",
  "sinks": "Outputs encrypted or transformed text via click.echo.",
  "flows": "Input text from CLI -> encryption/transformation functions in core module -> output displayed in CLI.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of dynamic import for TABLES is benign if controlled.",
  "analysis": "The script imports multiple encryption functions from a core module and exposes them as CLI commands. It uses click for command parsing and execution, with user inputs directly passed to core functions. No code injection, network activity, or suspicious operations are present. The dynamic import of TABLES appears to be a controlled dependency for substitution tables, not malicious. The code appears straightforward and benign, focusing solely on encryption tasks. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code acts solely as a CLI frontend for cryptographic functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard command-line interface implementation for a cryptography toolkit.",
