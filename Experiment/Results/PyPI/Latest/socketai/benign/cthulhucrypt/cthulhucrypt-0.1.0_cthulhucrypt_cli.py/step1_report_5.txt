{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for various encryption functions of the CthulhuCrypt toolkit.",
  "sources": "Input is received from command-line arguments (text, table-id, iterations).",
  "sinks": "Output is printed to the console via click.echo().",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments flows into the encryption functions, and results are displayed via echo; no untrusted data flows into external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. The code appears to be straightforward CLI wrapper for encryption functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports and wraps core encryption functions with CLI commands using click. It takes input from user via command-line arguments, processes it with the core functions, and outputs results to the console. No untrusted data is sent over network, no backdoors, no suspicious code, or malicious behavior observed. All functions seem to be intended for encryption purposes. No code obfuscation, hidden behavior, or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a CLI wrapper around encryption functions without any malicious or suspicious activity. No security risks or malware behavior are identified.",
