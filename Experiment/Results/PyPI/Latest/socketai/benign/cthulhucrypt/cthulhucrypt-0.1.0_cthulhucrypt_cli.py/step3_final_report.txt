  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for various cryptographic functions, facilitating user interaction with encryption routines.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments passed to cryptographic functions.",
  "sinks": "Output of processed data to the console; no data leaks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input received from CLI arguments → functions like super_encrypt, character_pairing, etc. process data → results displayed via click.echo.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or network activity detected. The import of TABLES is controlled and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface wrapping cryptographic functions imported from a core module. It accepts user input, processes it through these functions, and outputs results. No network operations, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. The functions' names suggest standard encryption routines, and the code structure is clear and well-organized. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are consistent with this benign assessment. The primary assumption is that the core functions are legitimate; if they are malicious, the risk would increase, but based on this wrapper alone, the behavior is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, transparent CLI wrapper around cryptographic functions with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
