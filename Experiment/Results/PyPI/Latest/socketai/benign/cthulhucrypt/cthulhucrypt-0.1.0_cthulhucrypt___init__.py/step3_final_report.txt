{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer that re-exports specific functions from the core module for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from the local '.core' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only re-exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py file that imports functions from a local module and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network operations, or obfuscation. The core functions could be malicious if their implementations are malicious, but this cannot be determined from this file alone. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with high confidence, and assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard package initializer with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
