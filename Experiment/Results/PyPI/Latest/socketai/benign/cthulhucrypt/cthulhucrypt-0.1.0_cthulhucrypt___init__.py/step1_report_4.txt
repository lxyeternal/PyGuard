{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an __init__ module for the cthulhucrypt package, re-exporting functions from the core submodule for easier access.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the .core module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in this code segment",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks within this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only handles module imports and exports",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific functions from a local module (.core) and defines __all__ for module exports. It contains no dynamic execution, user input handling, or other behaviors that could indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, no external network activity, and no obfuscated code are present. The structure is typical for Python package __init__ files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
