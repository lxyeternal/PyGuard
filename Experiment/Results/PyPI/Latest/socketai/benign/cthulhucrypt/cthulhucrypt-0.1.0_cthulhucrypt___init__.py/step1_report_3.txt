  "purpose": "This code initializes the cthulhucrypt package by importing specific encryption and transformation functions from the core module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core module",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sources or sinks are evident in this snippet",
  "flows": "Imports functions from core, making them available for external use",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and standard for package initialization",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports functions related to encryption and data transformation, then exposes them via __all__ for module exports. There are no dynamic executions, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious operations. It appears to be standard package setup code without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
