  "purpose": "This module serves as an initializer for the cthulhucrypt package, exposing various encryption and transformation functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the core module within the same package",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and exports functions without data processing or input/output operations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific functions from a local core module and defines __all__ for export. It lacks any input handling, external data reading, or potentially malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns, external network calls, or backdoors are evident. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for Python package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
