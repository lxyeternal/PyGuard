  "purpose": "To re-export multiple functions from the core module, likely for encryption or data transformation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the .core module within the package",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or external communication detected",
  "flows": "Importing functions from core module, no data flow involving external untrusted sources observed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior observed in this init file",
  "analysis": "The file simply re-exports functions from the core module, serving as an interface. It does not contain any logic, data handling, or external interactions. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The core functions imported could potentially be used maliciously, but this cannot be determined from this file alone.",
  "conclusion": "This __init__.py file appears to be a straightforward module initializer with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It primarily facilitates the package's API surface. Given only this code, there are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
