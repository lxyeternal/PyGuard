  "purpose": "This module re-exports functions from the core submodule for use elsewhere, likely related to encryption or obfuscation routines.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the local '.core' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; the code only defines exports",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or output are evident in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py file that imports specific functions from a sibling core module and defines an __all__ list for export. There are no data processing, no input handling, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns observed. The structure is typical for Python package modules, aiming to facilitate namespace management. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this minimal code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module initializer that exposes certain functions. No malicious intent or security concerns are detected in this snippet.",
