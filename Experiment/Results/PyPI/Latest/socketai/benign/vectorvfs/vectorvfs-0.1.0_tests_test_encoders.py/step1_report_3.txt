  "purpose": "Unit testing the PerceptionEncoder class's methods for vision and text encoding, logit scaling, and similarity calculations.",
  "sources": "Reading image files ('cat.jpg', 'dog.jpg') from the 'data' directory, invoking methods of PerceptionEncoder class.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is being written out or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Input files are read as data sources; data flows into encoder methods; computed features are used in similarity calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit tests for a machine learning encoder class, involving reading image files, encoding them, and computing similarities. No network activity, no handling of untrusted input beyond local file reads, and no suspicious data processing are present. The code appears to be straightforward testing logic without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test suite for a perception encoder, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads local image files and tests the encoder's functions. No malware or security threats are detected.",
