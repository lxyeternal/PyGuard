  "purpose": "Unit testing for the PerceptionEncoder class, including encoding images and text, computing logits, and similarity measures.",
  "sources": "Reading image files (cat.jpg, dog.jpg) from the data directory.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is output or used in unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input image paths are read, processed by encode_vision; text input processed by encode_text; results used in computations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard use of testing framework, file paths, and tensor operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a specific encoder class. It reads image files from a data directory, encodes them and text, and performs tensor operations including softmax and matrix multiplication. The logic is consistent with testing features and similarity calculations. No hardcoded credentials, network access, or potentially malicious behavior are observed. Usage of torch inference mode and basic file I/O indicates standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test for a perception encoder with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It solely tests functionality of encoding and similarity measures within a controlled environment.",
