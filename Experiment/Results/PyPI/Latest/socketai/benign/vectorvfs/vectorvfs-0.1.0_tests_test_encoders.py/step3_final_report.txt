  "purpose": "Unit tests for the PerceptionEncoder class, verifying vision and text encoding, logit scaling, and similarity calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads image files ('cat.jpg', 'dog.jpg') from local data directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external network calls, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Local image file inputs to encoding functions, with internal tensor operations and similarity computations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit testing suite utilizing standard libraries (torch, pathlib, unittest). It reads local image files, encodes them, and performs similarity calculations. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious code patterns are present. The code's logic is typical for ML model testing, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs. All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the thorough review and absence of any suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit testing script for the PerceptionEncoder, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and appropriate.",
