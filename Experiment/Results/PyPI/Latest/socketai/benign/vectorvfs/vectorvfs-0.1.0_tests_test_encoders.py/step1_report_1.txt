{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for PerceptionEncoder class methods including vision encoding, text encoding, logit scaling, and similarity computation.",
  "sources": "Reading image files from the data directory; calling methods of PerceptionEncoder class; loading data via encode_vision and encode_text functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or external data transmission observed; no sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input image paths are read, passed to encoder methods, and the features are processed; no data flows into any external system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations detected; standard unit testing code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical unit tests for a machine learning encoder class, including reading images, encoding text, and computing similarities. It uses torch and Path for file handling and torch operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling is evident. The code relies on external libraries (torch, Path, unittest) and internal class methods, but nothing appears malicious or maliciously modified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard unit testing code for a machine learning encoder, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate testing code with no suspicious elements.",
