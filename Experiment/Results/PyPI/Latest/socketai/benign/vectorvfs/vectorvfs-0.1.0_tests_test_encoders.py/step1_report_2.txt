{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the PerceptionEncoder class in the vectorvfs.encoders module, testing vision and text encoding, logit scaling, and similarity scoring.",
  "sources": "Input data files (cat.jpg, dog.jpg) read via Path objects for encoding functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or system commands are present. No output to external systems or sensitive data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "Input files are read by encode_vision; text input is directly passed to encode_text; features are processed within the class methods with no external or unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns observed. No obfuscated or malicious constructs. No backdoors or malicious system manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing on a perception encoder class, involving reading image files, encoding text, and performing similarity computations. All operations utilize safe, well-known libraries (torch, pathlib, unittest). No external network, system modifications, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code appears purely for testing functionality without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for a perception encoding class with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It operates solely on local files and standard computational methods.",
