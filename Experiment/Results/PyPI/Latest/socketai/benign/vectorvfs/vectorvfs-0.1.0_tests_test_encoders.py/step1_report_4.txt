  "purpose": "Unit testing the PerceptionEncoder class for encoding vision and text, and calculating similarity scores.",
  "sources": "Reading image files ('cat.jpg', 'dog.jpg') from the data directory.",
  "sinks": "Uses the encoder's methods which process images and text, and performs tensor operations; no direct untrusted data sinks or external network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads to encoder methods, then through tensor operations for similarity calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. Uses standard libraries and methods.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit tests using PyTorch and pathlib, with no external network connections, no execution of untrusted code, and no suspicious patterns. It reads local image files for testing, encodes them, and performs tensor operations to validate functionality. All functions are consistent with typical testing routines; no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward unit testing script for a perception encoder, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates locally, uses standard libraries, and has no suspicious code paths.",
