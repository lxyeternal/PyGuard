  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface and a concrete implementation for encoding images and text into embeddings using a CLIP-based perception model.",
  "sources": "Import statements for core modules, torch, PIL.Image, and environment variables for device setup.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent over network or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input image files are read via Image.open and processed; input text is tokenized; data flows through model inference steps for encoding.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of torch.device for hardware selection is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an abstract base class for dual encoders and implements a perception encoder using a CLIP-like model. It loads model configurations, handles image and text inputs, performs inference, and returns feature tensors. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. All operations are standard for model inference pipelines. Environment setup, model loading, and tensor processing follow typical patterns without hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a vision-text encoding interface using a CLIP model. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or sabotage. It is a typical model inference codebase with no security concerns.",
