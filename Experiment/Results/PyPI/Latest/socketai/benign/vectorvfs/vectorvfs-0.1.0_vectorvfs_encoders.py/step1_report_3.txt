  "purpose": "Defines abstract and concrete classes for encoding images and text into embeddings using a CLIP-based model, for perception tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements for core modules, torch, and PIL; class constructors, methods accessing model properties.",
  "sinks": "None evident. No use of untrusted inputs directly affecting system state or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Image file path input -> Image.open() -> preprocess -> model inference; Text input -> tokenizer -> model inference; Access to model.logit_scale for similarity scoring.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. Uses standard library functions, PyTorch, and custom core modules without suspicious code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation for encoding images and text using a CLIP-like model, with no signs of malicious behavior. It loads models, processes inputs, and computes embeddings, all in a typical manner. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Usage of torch inference mode and device management appears standard. Importing core modules is benign as long as they are legitimate and trustworthy. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical, legitimate implementation of a perception encoder class based on a CLIP model. No malicious behavior, malicious code, or suspicious activities detected. The code is well-structured and uses standard libraries and practices.",
