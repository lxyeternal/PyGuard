{
  "purpose": "Provide utility classes and functions for performance timing and image extension filtering.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; internal function calls and method access.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points; no output or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard libraries without malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager/decorator for timing execution and a function to initialize PIL image handling and retrieve supported image extensions. No external input handling, network activity, or data leakage points are present. The code relies solely on well-known libraries and functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The purpose is straightforward and aligns with normal utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears benign, serving as utility code for performance measurement and image extension filtering. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. Overall security risk is minimal.",
