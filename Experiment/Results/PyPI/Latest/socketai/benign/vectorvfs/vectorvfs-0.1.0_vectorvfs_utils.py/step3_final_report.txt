  "purpose": "Utility functions for measuring elapsed time and retrieving supported image extensions from PIL.",
  "sources": "No external input; interactions with internal libraries (time, PIL).",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or external data flows; internal API calls only.",
  "flows": "Code calls internal functions; no untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward use of standard libraries; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a timing context manager/decorator and a function to initialize PIL and filter supported image extensions based on openable formats and MIME types. It uses standard, well-documented APIs without any suspicious or malicious constructs. No external data handling, network activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is benign, and the implementation is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for performance measurement and image format querying. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (0 or 0.1) reflecting the benign nature.",
