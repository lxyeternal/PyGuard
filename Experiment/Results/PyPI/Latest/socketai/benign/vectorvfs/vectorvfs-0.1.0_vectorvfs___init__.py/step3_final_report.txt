{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, typically used for package versioning in Python modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process external data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment with no data movement or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line assigning a string to __version__, a common practice for versioning. No input/output, data flows, or external communication are involved. The code is not obfuscated, nor does it contain any suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and high confidence. No anomalies or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string assignment with no security risks or malicious behavior. The current scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
