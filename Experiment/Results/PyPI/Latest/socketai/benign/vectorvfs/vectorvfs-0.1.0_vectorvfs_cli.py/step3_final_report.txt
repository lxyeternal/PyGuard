  "purpose": "A CLI utility for searching files based on similarity to a text query using perception encoders, processing image files, encoding features, and computing similarity scores.",
  "sources": "User input query, image files in specified directory, model loading, file metadata, environment variables (indirectly via external modules).",
  "sinks": "Similarity computation results, console logs, tensor storage in VFSStore, potential exception handling masking errors.",
  "flows": "Input query encoded -> image files processed -> features encoded and normalized -> stored or retrieved from VFS -> similarity computed -> results displayed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try/except blocks around encoding functions, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate operations: loading models, encoding text and images, normalizing features, and computing similarity. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is detected. Broad exception handling is present but appears intended for robustness, not malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The low security risk score reflects minor concerns about error masking but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign CLI tool for image and text similarity search. No malware, backdoors, or malicious activities are present. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The overall security posture is low risk, with only minor coding style considerations.",
