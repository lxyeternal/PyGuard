  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same simple function: exporting a graph visualization to an HTML file using `graph.show(output_path)` and printing a confirmation.\n- No report indicates any suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The code relies on the `graph` object having a `show` method, which is typical for visualization libraries like Plotly, PyVis, etc.\n- The function is straightforward, with no external network activity, data exfiltration, or credential handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and straightforward.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- They do not overstate security risks; the security risk scores are appropriately low.\n- The mention of potential external dependencies (like Plotly) is correct but not inherently risky here.\n\n### Scores and justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports give 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is suggested.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports give 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation (0.1 in report 4), but given the simplicity, even this could be considered negligible. No actual vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The high confidence scores (mostly 1) are justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very minimal, possibly just acknowledging reliance on external libraries, but no real risk)\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (acknowledging that the code relies on external libraries and file I/O, but no security concern)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign utility function with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. The scores assigned are appropriate, and I agree with them.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Keep the scores as they are, perhaps lowering the minimal security risk to 0 if further context confirms no external dependencies pose any threat.  \n- No further action needed.\n\n**End of review.**",
