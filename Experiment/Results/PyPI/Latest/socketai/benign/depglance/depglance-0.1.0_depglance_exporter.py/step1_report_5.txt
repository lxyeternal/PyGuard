  "purpose": "Function to export a graph visualization to an HTML file and print a confirmation message.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'graph' and 'output_path'.",
  "sinks": "The 'graph.show(output_path)' function could potentially execute or generate content based on 'graph' object data.",
  "flows": "The 'graph.show' method processes 'graph' and writes output to 'output_path'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The 'print' statement is standard output.",
  "analysis": "The function simply calls the 'show' method on a 'graph' object, passing 'output_path' as filename, then prints a success message. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor is any untrusted data processed or transmitted. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility function for exporting a graph visualization. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
