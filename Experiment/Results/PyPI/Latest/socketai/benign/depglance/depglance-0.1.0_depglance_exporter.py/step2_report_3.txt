  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe code is a simple utility function:\n```python\ndef export_graph(graph, output_path=\"dependency_graph.html\"):\n    graph.show(output_path)\n    print(f\"✅ Dependency graph exported to {output_path}\")\n```\nIt calls `graph.show(output_path)` and then prints a confirmation message. The `graph` object is assumed to have a `show` method, typical of visualization libraries like Plotly, PyVis, etc.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Report 1\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, straightforward use of `graph.show`.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n### 2. Report 2\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### 3. Report 3\n- **Findings:** Similar analysis, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### 4. Report 4\n- **Findings:** Slightly less confidence (0.9), mentions that `graph.show` \"potentially\" writes an HTML file.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1, possibly due to the uncertainty about what `graph.show` does internally.\n- **Assessment:** Given the minimal code and standard usage, the risk is very low. The slight uncertainty in confidence and security risk is reasonable, but the malware score remains 0 because no malicious activity is indicated.\n\n### 5. Report 5\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the reports.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports correctly assign malware=0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as the code is simple and does not process untrusted data beyond calling `graph.show`.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume `graph.show` is benign. Given the context, unless the `graph` object is from an untrusted source or `show` executes arbitrary code, this is reasonable.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final scoring estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent across all reports)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** Given the simplicity and lack of malicious activity, I would assign a very low risk score, around **0.1** to **0.2** to account for the minimal uncertainty, but not higher.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Code is benign.** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks detected.\n- **Scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0.**\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal uncertainty but overall low risk).\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0. Confirm the risk score at around 0.1, considering the function's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.",
