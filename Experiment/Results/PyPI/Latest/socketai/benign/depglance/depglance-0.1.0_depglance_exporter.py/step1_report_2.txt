{
  "purpose": "The function is designed to export and save a graph visualization to an HTML file.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'graph' used to generate the visualization; 'output_path' string parameter for file location",
  "sinks": "The 'graph.show(output_path)' method which writes output to a file",
  "flows": "The function receives a graph object and a file path, then calls 'graph.show' to generate the output file",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward with standard graph export functionality",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to export a graph visualization to an HTML file. It calls 'graph.show(output_path)', which likely serializes the graph into a visual HTML format. The print statement confirms export success. There are no indications of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. Usage of 'graph.show' depends on the graph object implementation, but as written, this is typical graph export functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple graph export utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely saves a visual representation of a graph to a specified HTML file.",
