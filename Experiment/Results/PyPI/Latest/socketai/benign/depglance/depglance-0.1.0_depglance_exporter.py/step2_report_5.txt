  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, calling `graph.show(output_path)` and printing a confirmation message.\n- No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The `graph.show()` method is typical of visualization libraries like Plotly or PyVis, which generate HTML files for visualization.\n- No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are indicated.\n\n**Code confirmation:**\n- The code snippet matches the described behavior in all reports.\n- The function is benign, serving as a utility to export a graph visualization.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Security risk: 0 or very close to 0, since no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- Confidence: 1 in all reports, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Potential issues or points of contention:**\n- The only minor point is the report 4 assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, which seems slightly overcautious given the analysis. The code doesn't process untrusted data, doesn't execute external code, and has no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a benign utility function for exporting graph visualizations.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable, though the slight security risk in report 4 could be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n- No evidence suggests any malware or malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, with no indications of malware or obfuscation, and poses no security risk. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a slight note that the minimal security risk in report 4 could be lowered to zero for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- Confirm that the `graph.show()` method is from a trusted library (e.g., Plotly, PyVis). If so, the risk remains negligible.\n- No further action needed; the code is benign.",
