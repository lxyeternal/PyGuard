{
  "purpose": "The function exports a graph visualization to an HTML file and prints a confirmation message.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'graph' and 'output_path'; the 'graph' object is used in graph.show(output_path).",
  "sinks": "The 'graph.show(output_path)' likely writes to the filesystem; the 'print' statement outputs to console.",
  "flows": "Input 'graph' is passed to 'graph.show', which writes to 'output_path'; no untrusted data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No external network activity or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that calls 'show' on a 'graph' object, saving an HTML file, and prints a confirmation. The use of a default output path and straightforward print statement indicates standard behavior. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious logic. The code performs a benign export operation with no external dependencies involved beyond the expected graph object.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function to export a graph visualization, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
