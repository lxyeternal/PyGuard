{
  "purpose": "The function exports a graph visualization to an HTML file.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'graph', which is expected to be a graph object with a 'show' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'graph.show(output_path)' method potentially writes an HTML file to the specified output path.",
  "flows": "The 'graph' object is used as input; the 'show' method writes to 'output_path'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward function that takes a graph object and exports its visualization to an HTML file. It uses the 'show' method of the graph object to generate the output, then prints a confirmation message. The function relies on the provided 'graph' object having a 'show' method that writes to a file, which is a common pattern for visualization libraries like Plotly or PyVis. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or unauthorized system access. The code appears benign and purpose-specific.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility function for exporting a graph visualization to an HTML file. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
