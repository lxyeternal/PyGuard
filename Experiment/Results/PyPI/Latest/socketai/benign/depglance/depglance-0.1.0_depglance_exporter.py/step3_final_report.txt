  "purpose": "Export a graph visualization to an HTML file and confirm the export.",
  "sources": "The 'graph' object with 'show' method, 'output_path' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Creates an HTML file at the specified output path.",
  "flows": "The function calls 'graph.show(output_path)', which generates and saves the visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that invokes 'graph.show' with a filename and prints a confirmation message. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No malicious activity, data leakage, or obfuscation is present. The 'graph' object is assumed to be from a visualization library like Plotly or PyVis, which is standard. The function does not process untrusted data or execute external code beyond calling 'show()'. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the security risk score is very low, around 0.1, reflecting minimal uncertainty. Confidence in benign assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for exporting a graph visualization. No evidence of malicious intent, malware, obfuscation, or security risks is present. The scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, with high confidence.",
