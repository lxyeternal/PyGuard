{
  "purpose": "Exports a graph visualization to an HTML file.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'graph' used in 'graph.show(output_path)'. 'output_path' parameter with default value.",
  "sinks": "The 'graph.show(output_path)' call writes to a file specified by 'output_path'.",
  "flows": "Input 'graph' is used to generate and save an HTML graph file. The 'output_path' determines where the file is written.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The function accepts a graph object and an optional output path. It calls the 'show' method of the 'graph' object to generate a visualization, then prints a confirmation message. The use of 'graph.show' suggests reliance on a graph library (e.g., Plotly or similar). There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The code is simple and focused solely on exporting a graph visualization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for exporting a graph visualization. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
