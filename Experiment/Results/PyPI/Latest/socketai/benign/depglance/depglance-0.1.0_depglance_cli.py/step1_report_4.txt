  "purpose": "The script is a CLI tool designed to visualize Python dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Input path to requirements.txt provided via command-line argument",
  "sinks": "Functions that process the requirements file, perform vulnerability scanning, generate dependency graph, and export the graph",
  "flows": "User provides requirements file path -> parse_requirements reads the file -> scan_vulnerabilities processes package data -> generate_graph creates visualization -> export_graph outputs the result",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard libraries and clear function calls. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line input to obtain a requirements file path. It then calls functions to parse dependencies, scan for vulnerabilities, generate a dependency graph, and export the graph. All functions are imported from a presumably legitimate depglance package. No untrusted input processing beyond reading a file path, and no dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI utility for dependency visualization and vulnerability scanning. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this module. It relies on external, presumably safe, functions from the depglance package. Overall, it presents low security concern.",
