  "purpose": "CLI tool to visualize Python dependencies from a requirements.txt file and scan for vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Reads the requirements file path from command line input.",
  "sinks": "Potential vulnerability scanning and graph exporting functions; no direct data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "User provides requirements path -> parse_requirements -> scan_vulnerabilities -> generate_graph -> export_graph.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated features detected. The code relies on external functions which are not provided; no indication of malicious behavior in the visible code.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as an entry point for a dependency analysis tool. It accepts a file path as input, processes it through several functions, and produces a dependency graph. There are no suspicious or malicious activities such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code execution. All functions appear to be standard processing steps. Without access to the internal implementations of imported functions, no malicious intent is evident. The structure and code style are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point for a dependency analysis tool. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are apparent based on this code snippet. It appears to be a legitimate utility script.",
