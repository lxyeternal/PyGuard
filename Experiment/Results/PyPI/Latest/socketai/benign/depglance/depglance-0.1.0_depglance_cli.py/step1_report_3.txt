  "purpose": "CLI tool to visualize Python dependencies from a requirements.txt file and scan for vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Reads the requirements file path from command line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Functions that generate dependency graphs, scan for vulnerabilities, and export the graph data.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> parse_requirements -> scan_vulnerabilities -> generate_graph -> export_graph",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard libraries and functions from the 'depglance' package to process dependencies and vulnerabilities. No external or untrusted data handling beyond reading a file path is present. The functions invoked are typical for dependency analysis tools, and no suspicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward CLI wrapper around the 'depglance' library functions. The overall structure is simple and conventional for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a dependency visualization and vulnerability scanning CLI. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. The code appears safe, with no signs of malware or malicious anomalies.",
