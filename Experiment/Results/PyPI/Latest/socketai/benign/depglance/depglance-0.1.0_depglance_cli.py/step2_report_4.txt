  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and assessing the scores assigned.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The script is a straightforward CLI entry point.\n- It imports functions from 'depglance' (parse_requirements, scan_vulnerabilities, generate_graph, export_graph).\n- It accepts a requirements.txt file path as input.\n- It processes the input through these functions in sequence.\n- No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code appears to be a standard utility wrapper.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the code is a simple CLI wrapper with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score seems appropriate given the simplicity. The malware score is correctly zero, as no malicious behavior is indicated.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the lack of suspicious code, network calls, or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk is set to 0, which aligns with the analysis. Malware remains zero.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above; no malicious activity or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk (0.2) but still low; justified given the benign code.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; low risk score matches the benign code.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk, but justified given the benign nature.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2), but all are low and justified.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with benign utility.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent with the code provided. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a legitimate, straightforward CLI wrapper for dependency analysis, with no malicious or obfuscated features.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (average ~0.15)  \n\nThe overall assessment indicates no security concern based on this snippet.",
