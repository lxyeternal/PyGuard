  "purpose": "CLI tool for visualizing Python dependencies and scanning for vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Input path to requirements.txt file provided via command line argument.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data output or external network calls within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Requirement file path -> parse_requirements -> scan_vulnerabilities -> generate_graph -> export_graph",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs observed. The functions imported could contain issues, but their code is not provided.",
  "analysis": "The script parses a user-supplied requirements file, then processes the dependencies to scan for vulnerabilities, generates a dependency graph, and exports it. All steps involve calling external functions imported from 'depglance'. There are no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no evidence of malicious behavior within this script. The input is controlled by the user, and outputs are generated via standard functions, with no signs of hidden or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI entry point for dependency analysis with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. It relies on external functions whose security cannot be assessed here, but the control flow and data handling are benign.",
