  "purpose": "This script is a CLI tool for visualizing Python dependencies by parsing requirements, scanning for vulnerabilities, generating a dependency graph, and exporting it.",
  "sources": "Reads the requirements file specified as a command-line argument",
  "sinks": "Calls functions that likely process and output a dependency graph; no direct data leaks or malicious output is evident",
  "flows": "Input from requirements file -> parse_requirements() -> scan_vulnerabilities() -> generate_graph() -> export_graph()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected; functions are imported from a reputable-looking package 'depglance'",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an argument parser to accept a requirements file path, then sequentially calls functions to parse dependencies, scan vulnerabilities, generate a graph, and export it. All steps are typical for dependency analysis tools. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious external network activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard CLI wrapper around dependency analysis functions. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, nor does it pose security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility for dependency visualization.",
