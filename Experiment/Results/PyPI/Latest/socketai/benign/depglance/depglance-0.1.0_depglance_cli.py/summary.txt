  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI utility for dependency visualization and vulnerability scanning. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this snippet. The external functions' security posture remains unknown but is assumed safe based on context. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the benign nature of the code."
