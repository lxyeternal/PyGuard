  "purpose": "CLI utility for visualizing Python dependencies, parsing requirements, scanning vulnerabilities, generating dependency graphs, and exporting the visualization.",
  "sources": "Input requirement file path provided via command line argument.",
  "sinks": "None within the visible code; external functions may process data internally but are not shown.",
  "flows": "Input path -> parse_requirements -> scan_vulnerabilities -> generate_graph -> export_graph",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that orchestrates functions from the 'depglance' package. It accepts a requirements file, processes dependencies, scans for vulnerabilities, generates a graph, and exports it. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior is evident. The external functions' internal security cannot be assessed here, but the structure and usage are typical for dependency analysis tools. The code is clear, simple, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI utility for dependency visualization and vulnerability scanning. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this snippet. The external functions' security posture remains unknown but is assumed safe based on context. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
