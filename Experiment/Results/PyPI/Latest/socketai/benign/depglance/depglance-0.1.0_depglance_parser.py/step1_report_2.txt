{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse different types of dependency files used in Python projects, such as requirements.txt, Pipfile, and poetry.lock, to extract package names.",
  "sources": "File reads from the specified paths for each supported file type (requirements.txt, Pipfile, poetry.lock). It also reads lines from these files during parsing.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to local filesystem via open() calls and reads from it. No untrusted data is directly sent over the network, executed as code, or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "The code reads file paths, loads or reads files, and extracts package names through regex parsing or TOML parsing, then returns the list of packages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code performs straightforward parsing tasks without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs file type checking based on filename extensions, then uses standard libraries to parse package dependency files. The use of 're' for splitting lines in requirements.txt is typical. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected; the functions are simple, standard parsing routines. The code does not execute untrusted input, communicate over networks, or modify system state beyond reading files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard dependency parser with no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It reads and processes dependency files securely and without suspicious activity.",
