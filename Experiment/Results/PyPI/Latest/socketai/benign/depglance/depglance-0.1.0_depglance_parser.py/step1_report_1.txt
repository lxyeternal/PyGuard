{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse different types of Python dependency files (requirements.txt, Pipfile, poetry.lock) to extract package names.",
  "sources": "File reading operations in _parse_requirements_txt and _parse_poetry_lock functions; reading and parsing the specified files.",
  "targets": "The package names extracted and returned by the functions; no direct output or network activity.",
  "flows": "File read -> parse lines -> extract package names -> return list of packages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The regex and parsing logic are straightforward and typical. No malicious behavior or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads dependency files using standard methods. The _parse_requirements_txt function strips comments and version specifiers to list package names; the _parse_pipfile reads TOML data; the _parse_poetry_lock searches for package blocks and extracts names. No external network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of 're' for splitting is safe; no unsafe code or malicious patterns are evident. The code serves a benign purpose for dependency management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical dependency parser with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It operates on standard file formats to extract package information without any suspicious behavior.",
