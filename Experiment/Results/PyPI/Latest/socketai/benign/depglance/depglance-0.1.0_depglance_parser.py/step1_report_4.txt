{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse different types of dependency files (requirements.txt, Pipfile, poetry.lock) to extract package names.",
  "sources": "File input via open() calls reading from specified file paths.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external sources, executes untrusted code, or interacts with the network.",
  "flows": "File reading operations supply data to parsing logic; regex splitting and toml loading process data without user interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code appears straightforward and standard for dependency parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code reads dependency files to extract package names, using open() to read files and regex or toml to parse contents. No untrusted data is used in a way that would lead to injection or leakage. The logic is standard for dependency management and does not perform any malicious actions or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign dependency parser with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
