{
  "purpose": "The code parses dependency files (requirements.txt, Pipfile, poetry.lock) to extract package names.",
  "sources": "Reads input files from filesystem: 'requirements.txt', 'Pipfile', 'poetry.lock'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> processes lines or parses content -> outputs package list.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward parsing of dependency files using standard libraries and techniques. It does not execute untrusted code, connect to networks, or handle secrets. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The logic is transparent and aligns with typical dependency management scripts. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency parser with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
