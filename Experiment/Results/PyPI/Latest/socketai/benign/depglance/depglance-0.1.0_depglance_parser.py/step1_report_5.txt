{
  "purpose": "The code parses dependency files (requirements.txt, Pipfile, poetry.lock) to extract package names.",
  "sources": "File reading operations (`open()`), user-provided file paths",
  "sinks": "None observed; no output or data transmission points",
  "flows": "File paths input -> file reading -> parsing functions -> returned package lists",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors; no suspicious network activity or malicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file parsing operations to extract package names from common Python dependency files. It uses regex and string operations for parsing. No code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious activities are present. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are evident. The code appears straightforward and aligned with typical dependency parsing functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard dependency parser without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It simply reads and processes dependency files to extract package names, with no evident security risks.",
