{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the 'parse_requirements' function from the 'depviz.parser' module to verify parsing correctness.",
  "sources": "File input 'test_requirements.txt' created and written within the test method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks observed; no network, file, or sensitive data operations beyond the test scope.",
  "flows": "Writing to 'test_requirements.txt' as a source, then reading from it via 'parse_requirements'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is a straightforward test setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple unit test by creating a test requirement file, writing sample package dependencies, then calling 'parse_requirements' to parse the file and verify output. The code does not contain any dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration. It appears to be a benign test script for parsing dependencies. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The test setup and execution are standard for unit testing.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign unit test script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads and writes a local file for testing purposes only, with no evidence of malware or security threats.",
