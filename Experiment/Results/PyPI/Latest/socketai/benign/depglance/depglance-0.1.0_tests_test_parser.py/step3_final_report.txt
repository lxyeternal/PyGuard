  "purpose": "Unit test for parsing requirements from a file",
  "sources": "Reads from local file 'test_requirements.txt' created within the test",
  "sinks": "parse_requirements function processes the file content; no untrusted data flows beyond local file handling",
  "flows": "File creation -> writing dependencies -> parsing dependencies -> assertion check",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward file I/O and parsing",
  "analysis": "The code creates a local test file with dependencies and a comment, then parses it to extract package names, asserting correctness. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behavior is present. The code uses standard testing practices with no external network or sensitive data handling. The associated reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are detected. The test environment is controlled, and the code is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
