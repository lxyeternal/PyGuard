  "purpose": "Unit testing for the 'parse_requirements' function in the depviz.parser module.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'test_requirements.txt' file created during the test.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or transmitted to external systems.",
  "flows": "Creates a test file, writes sample requirements, reads the file to parse dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard unit test by writing a temporary file with dependency specifications, then parsing it using a presumably safe parser function. There are no signs of malicious code, external network activity, or obfuscated behavior. The test is straightforward, designed solely to verify functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign unit test with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
