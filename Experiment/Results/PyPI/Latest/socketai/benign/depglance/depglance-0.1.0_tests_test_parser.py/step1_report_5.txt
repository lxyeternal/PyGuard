{
  "purpose": "Unit test for the parse_requirements function in depviz.parser module, verifying parsing of requirements file.",
  "sources": "Reading 'test_requirements.txt' file created within the test case.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted external data or lead to data leaks; file reading is controlled within the test.",
  "flows": "File writing -> parse_requirements function reading the file content.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically creates a requirements file for testing, but no malicious or unusual code is present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script writes a simple requirements list to a file and then reads it using parse_requirements. No external inputs, network connections, or data leaks are involved. The code appears to be a straightforward unit test without malicious intent or obfuscation. The only noteworthy point is the creation of a temporary file, but this is standard in testing environments. No malware signals detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test for a parser function, with no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks identified. It safely tests parsing functionality without external dependencies or malicious code.",
