  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'depglance' Python project, defining dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user input read; static code defining package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or malicious output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script only specifies package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code is standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities from setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies ('pyvis', 'requests'), and an entry point for command line interface. All elements are typical for a Python package setup. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident. The code performs a straightforward package configuration without any malicious or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
