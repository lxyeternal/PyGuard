{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the Python project 'depglance'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies ('pyvis', 'requests') and defines an entry point for a console script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the script only specifies package metadata and setup instructions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for Python packaging. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points without any dynamic code, external input handling, or suspicious constructs. The dependencies are common packages ('pyvis', 'requests'), and the entry point is a typical CLI command. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and purely functional for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
