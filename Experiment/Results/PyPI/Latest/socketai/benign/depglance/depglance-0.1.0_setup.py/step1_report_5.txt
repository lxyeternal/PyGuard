{
  "purpose": "This code is used to configure the packaging and distribution of a Python project named 'depglance'. It specifies metadata, dependencies, and command-line entry points for the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, dependencies, and entry point from the source code itself.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present. The code does not process or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static declarations to package setup configurations without involving untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code follows standard setup script practices. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' functions for packaging. It defines package metadata (name, version), finds packages automatically, specifies required dependencies ('pyvis', 'requests'), and sets up a console script entry point. All elements are typical for a Python package setup. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or unusual behavior. The code's purpose is clearly to facilitate package installation and command-line interface configuration, with no hidden actions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and typical for packaging a Python project.",
