{
  "purpose": "Minimal module header with descriptive comment and version variable, serving as metadata for the package.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only a comment and a variable assignment with no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks, external calls, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow exists as the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable logic, data handling, or external interactions; code is trivial and metadata-only.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module-level docstring and a version variable, with no functions, data flows, or external calls. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified given the benign and metadata-only nature of the code. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected. The code poses no security threat and is safe for use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, metadata-only, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security risk, malware, and obfuscation scores are all correctly set to zero. The reports are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
