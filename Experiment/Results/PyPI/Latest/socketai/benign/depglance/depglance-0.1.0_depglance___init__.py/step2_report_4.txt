  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the corresponding code snippets.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as minimal, containing only a module docstring and a version variable.\n- No sources, sinks, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n- No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The code appears to be a simple module header or metadata declaration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues reported present?**  \n  Yes. The code is as described: only a docstring and a version variable, with no functional logic.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the code as benign and metadata-only.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0  \n  These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical analysis:\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or malicious activity?**  \n  No. The code is purely declarative with no executable logic, no data handling, and no external calls.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and minimal.\n\n- **Risk score justification:**  \n  Since there's no code execution, data flow, or external interaction, the overall security risk remains zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The **malware score** should remain **0**.\n- The **obfuscated score** should remain **0**.\n- The **risk score** should be **0**, as there's no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, metadata-only, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's harmless nature and lack of any security issues.",
