{
  "purpose": "This code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but without further context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly from imported modules or external sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or data serialization points, especially if untrusted data is used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters, environment variables) through processing functions, possibly leading to network transmission, file output, or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are present. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard function definitions and data handling. It does not contain dynamic execution, obfuscated segments, or unusual language features. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical, and no hardcoded secrets are observed. Lack of complex data flows or suspicious operations suggests no malicious intent. Due to absence of specific malicious patterns, the overall risk is low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with standard data processing patterns and no signs of sabotage or malware.",
