  "sinks": "There are no identifiable sinks such as data exfiltration points, system modifications, or network transmissions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present because the code contains no executable content.",
  "anomalies": "The code is empty; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are observed. Lack of content prevents detection of malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is empty or contains no executable instructions. Therefore, no security issues, malicious behavior, or suspicious activities can be identified. The absence of content also limits the ability to evaluate potential risks or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided empty code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign but also lacks any functional purpose. Further review would require actual code content.",
