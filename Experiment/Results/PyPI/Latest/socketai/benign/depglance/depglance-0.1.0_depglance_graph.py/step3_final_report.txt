  "purpose": "Generate a network visualization of packages with vulnerability-based coloring.",
  "sources": "Input list of packages and vulnerabilities map",
  "sinks": "Adding nodes and edges to the network visualization",
  "flows": "Packages and vulnerabilities data -> node creation with color assignment -> sequential edge creation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious operations detected",
  "analysis": "The code creates a visualization using pyvis, adding nodes for each package with colors based on vulnerability counts, and dummy sequential edges. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present. The logic is straightforward and deterministic. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed. The code does not perform any insecure operations or obfuscation. The vulnerability counts influence node color but do not impact security or malware risk. The overall behavior is benign and intended for visualization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified as zero. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
