  "purpose": "Generate a network graph visualization of packages and their vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'packages' and 'vulnerabilities' from external sources, and the internal function '_get_color'.",
  "sinks": "Methods 'net.add_node' and 'net.add_edge' which add nodes and edges to the visualization object.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into node creation with package info and vulnerability count, then edges are created between sequential packages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic. The code performs straightforward data visualization without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to create a network graph with nodes representing packages, colored based on the number of vulnerabilities, and edges connecting sequential packages. The helper function assigns colors based on vulnerability counts. There is no external data fetching, network communication, or suspicious code constructs. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. The code is simple and appears to be solely for visualization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended for visualizing package dependencies and vulnerabilities. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
