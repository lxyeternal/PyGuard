  "purpose": "Serve a specified HTML file over HTTP and open it in the default web browser for local viewing.",
  "sources": "Reading the file path, changing directory with os.chdir(), and initiating the HTTP server.",
  "sinks": "webbrowser.open() launching the browser; serving files via http.server.",
  "flows": "os.chdir() sets directory -> http.server serves files -> webbrowser.open() opens URL in browser.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.chdir() could affect environment; minimal risk, standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries to serve a local HTML file and automatically open it in a browser. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The use of os.chdir() is typical for serving files from a specific directory. The webbrowser.open() call is benign in this context. No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code's purpose is benign, intended for local development or demonstration. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the automatic browser launch, which is common and not inherently risky. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the slight environmental impact but no actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward utility for serving and viewing a local HTML file. It does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
