  "purpose": "To serve a specified HTML file over a local web server and automatically open it in a web browser.",
  "sources": "Reads the file path parameter, changes working directory to the file's directory, and opens a web browser to access the server.",
  "sinks": "Starts a local HTTP server, opens a web browser to a local address.",
  "flows": "Reads the file path -> changes directory -> starts server -> opens browser -> serves the file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard library usage for local file serving and browser opening.",
  "analysis": "The code uses Python's built-in HTTP server modules to serve an HTML file from the local filesystem. It changes the working directory to the directory containing the HTML file, then starts a TCP server on port 8000. It automatically opens the served HTML in the default web browser. All operations are contained within the local environment, with no network connections to external domains, data leaks, or malicious activities detected. The logic is straightforward, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple local web server script for serving an HTML file and opening it in a web browser. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
