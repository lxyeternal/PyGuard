{
  "purpose": "Serve a specific HTML file over a local HTTP server and automatically open it in the default web browser.",
  "sources": "Reads the specified HTML file 'dependency_graph.html' from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Opens a web browser to access the local server; serves the HTML file over HTTP.",
  "flows": "Reads 'dependency_graph.html' -> Starts local server -> Opens browser to the local server URL.",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.chdir() to change working directory to the HTML file's directory, which could affect the process environment, but this is standard for serving files. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, or suspicious network connections beyond local server and browser opening.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for HTTP serving, socket management, web browsing, and OS operations. It defines a function to serve an HTML file on a specified port, changing the working directory to the file's directory for proper serving. It then starts a TCP server, opens the HTML in a browser, and serves indefinitely. No external network calls other than local server and browser are made. No obfuscation, malicious network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code performs a straightforward local file serving operation intended for local development or demonstration.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign utility for serving a local HTML file and opening it in a browser. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful behavior. The code is straightforward and serves a legitimate purpose.",
