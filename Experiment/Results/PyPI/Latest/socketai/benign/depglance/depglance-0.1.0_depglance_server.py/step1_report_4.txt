  "purpose": "Serve a specific HTML file over HTTP on localhost and automatically open it in a web browser.",
  "sources": "Reading the specified HTML file path and the current working directory.",
  "sinks": "Opening a web browser to a localhost URL, starting a local HTTP server.",
  "flows": "The code changes directory to the HTML file location, then starts a server serving that directory, and finally opens the browser to display the file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Uses standard library functions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes by changing the current directory to the location of the specified HTML file. It then sets up an HTTP server serving the current directory. It prints the server URL and automatically opens the default web browser to display the HTML file. The server runs indefinitely until manually stopped. No user input is processed, and no data is sent over the network beyond serving the HTML file. The code relies solely on standard libraries and performs a common local file serving task.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward utility for local testing or viewing an HTML file via a web browser. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or malicious code embedded within. It appears to be a benign, standard implementation with no malicious intent.",
