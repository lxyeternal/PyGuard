{
  "purpose": "Serve a specified HTML file over HTTP on localhost and automatically open it in the default web browser.",
  "sources": "Reading the current working directory (os.chdir), accessing the file path (file_path), and the webbrowser module to open URLs.",
  "sinks": "Opening a web browser to a local URL, serving files over HTTP via socketserver.TCPServer.",
  "flows": "The code changes directory to the location of the file, sets up an HTTP server, then opens a web browser pointing to the served file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no unusual network connections outside localhost, and no obfuscated code. Use of webbrowser.open to automatically launch a URL is standard but noteworthy.",
  "analysis": "The script changes the current working directory to the directory containing the target HTML file, then starts a local HTTP server serving files from that directory. It prints a serving message, automatically opens the default web browser to display the file, and runs indefinitely. The use of standard library modules (http.server, socketserver, webbrowser, os) poses no inherent security risk. The code operates solely on localhost, avoiding external network interactions. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Overall, the script performs a benign function—serving and viewing an HTML file locally.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward local file server with automatic browser launch. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions. The code appears safe, serving only local content without external network connections or malicious intent.",
