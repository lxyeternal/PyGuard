  "purpose": "Serve a specific HTML file over a local HTTP server and automatically open it in the default web browser.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(file_path), os.path.basename(file_path), webbrowser.open, socketserver.TCPServer, http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler",
  "sinks": "webbrowser.open (opens URL in browser), socketserver.TCPServer (binds to network port)",
  "flows": "Server binds to localhost port, then opens the HTML file in a web browser; no data flows outside local machine or to external sources",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual code structures. The code uses standard libraries for serving local files.",
  "analysis": "The script changes the working directory to the directory of the specified HTML file, then starts a local HTTP server on port 8000 serving that directory. It automatically opens the specified HTML file in the default web browser. No user input is processed, and all network activity is confined to localhost. The use of standard libraries and functions is typical for local file serving. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward local file server for serving an HTML file with automatic browser opening. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It is safe and intended for local development or viewing.",
