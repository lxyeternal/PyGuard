  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'; author info and entry points for CLI.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no code execution or network activity within this script.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static configuration without dynamic or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author name 'BLACK SPAMMER BD', unprofessional and potentially malicious branding, but not affecting code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The only anomaly is the author name, which raises suspicion but does not imply malicious code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with the risk score reflecting social suspicion rather than technical threat.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is safe and free of malicious behavior. The primary concern is the suspicious author name, which may indicate untrustworthiness but does not constitute a security risk within this code. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
