  "purpose": "The code initializes a presentation object using the tppt library with a new PowerPoint presentation created via the pptx library.",
  "sources": "Import statements; creating a new pptx.Presentation() object; passing it to tppt.Presentation()",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or sinks are evident",
  "flows": "Import pptx -> create pptx.Presentation() -> pass to tppt.Presentation()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pptx and tppt modules, then creates a new PowerPoint presentation using pptx.Presentation(). This presentation object is then passed to tppt.Presentation(). There is no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security risks. The usage appears to be straightforward library initialization for presentation creation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard initialization of presentation objects without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No security risks are evident.",
