  "purpose": "Create a PowerPoint presentation with a single slide containing an image.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'tppt' module; reading the image file 'your_image.png' for inclusion in the slide.",
  "sinks": "Saving the generated presentation to 'simple.pptx'. No data sink interacts with untrusted input directly; image file is a resource, not a sink.",
  "flows": "tppt.Presentation.builder() -> .slide() -> lambda function reading image -> .build() -> .save() to filesystem.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code simply uses a presentation library to embed an image.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a presentation library 'tppt' and uses a builder pattern to create a slide with a blank layout and embed an image 'your_image.png'. The image positioning and dimensions are specified with consistent units. The presentation is then saved to 'simple.pptx'. The operations are straightforward and utilize standard library features; no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign script that generates a PowerPoint file with an image. There are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
