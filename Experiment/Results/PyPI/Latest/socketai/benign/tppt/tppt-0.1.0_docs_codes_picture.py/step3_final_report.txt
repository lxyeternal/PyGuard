  "purpose": "Create a PowerPoint presentation with a single slide containing a specified image, saved locally.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'your_image.png' file from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Saving the presentation as 'simple.pptx' on disk.",
  "flows": "Code reads image file -> embeds image in slide -> saves presentation file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior; straightforward use of library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'tppt', constructs a presentation with a blank slide, embeds a static image at specified coordinates, and saves the file locally. No network activity, user input, or dynamic code execution is present. The filename 'your_image.png' is hardcoded, which is typical for static resources but could be a minor concern if maliciously replaced. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code is clear, simple, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward PowerPoint generation tool with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0–0.1) are appropriate and justified given the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
