  "purpose": "Create a PowerPoint presentation with a single slide containing 'Hello, World!' using the 'tppt' library.",
  "sources": "Import of 'tppt' library, usage of builder pattern to define slide and text content, file save operation.",
  "sinks": "File system write operation ('save' method) that outputs 'simple.pptx'; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Import 'tppt' -> build presentation with lambda -> add slide with text -> build -> save to file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of library with static content; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a presentation library, constructs a presentation with a single slide containing static text, and saves it to disk. No external data, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The use of builder pattern is standard, and the code performs a benign operation. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are evident. The minimal file creation activity is typical and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script for generating a PowerPoint file with static content. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, which is appropriate given the file creation but still indicates negligible risk.",
