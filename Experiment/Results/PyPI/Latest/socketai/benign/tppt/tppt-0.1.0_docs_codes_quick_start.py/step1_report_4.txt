  "purpose": "Generate a simple PowerPoint presentation with a single slide containing 'Hello, World!' text.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'tppt' module; calling methods to build and save a presentation.",
  "sinks": "Saving the presentation to a file named 'simple.pptx'.",
  "flows": "Import of 'tppt' -> Building slide with text -> Saving the presentation file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code, and no unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'tppt' and uses its API to construct a presentation with one slide containing a text box. The process appears straightforward, utilizing method chaining for clarity. The code only writes to a PPTX file named 'simple.pptx' and does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or invoke system commands. There are no indications of obfuscation or hidden malicious behavior. The module 'tppt' is assumed to be a legitimate library for presentation creation, and the code performs standard API calls without suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple presentation generator with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard operations using the 'tppt' library to create and save a PPTX file with basic content.",
