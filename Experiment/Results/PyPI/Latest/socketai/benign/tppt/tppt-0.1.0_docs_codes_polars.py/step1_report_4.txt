  "purpose": "Generate a PowerPoint presentation with a table displaying sample data using the tppt library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'tppt' and '_features', and the data source within 'PandasDataFrame'.",
  "sinks": "Method 'save' in 'tppt.Presentation.builder()', which writes a file 'simple.pptx'.",
  "flows": "Importing 'tppt', setting 'df' with sample data, building a presentation, adding a table with 'df', then saving the presentation to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or hidden behaviors. The code appears straightforward, with only standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a presentation library, creates a data frame with sample data, and constructs a PowerPoint presentation containing this data, then saves it locally. No user input, environment variable manipulation, or external network activity is present. The data used is static, and the save operation simply writes a file to disk. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. It appears to be a simple data presentation generator without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for creating a presentation from sample data. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
