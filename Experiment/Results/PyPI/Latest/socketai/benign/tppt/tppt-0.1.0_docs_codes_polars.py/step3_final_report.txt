  "purpose": "Generate a PowerPoint presentation from static sample data using the 'tppt' library.",
  "sources": "Static data defined within the code; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "File system where the presentation is saved ('simple.pptx'). No untrusted data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data is created in the DataFrame, passed to the presentation builder, and saved to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with static data and standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a presentation library, conditionally creates a DataFrame with hardcoded sample data, builds a PowerPoint slide with a table displaying this data, and saves the presentation. No network activity, user input, environment variables, or obfuscated code are involved. The data is static, and the functions used are standard for document generation. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing static presentation generation with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with scores reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
