  "purpose": "Generate a PowerPoint presentation with a table displaying sample data about fruits.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'tppt' library and its internal '_features' module, accessing 'USE_POLARS' and 'PandasDataFrame' variables.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'tppt.Presentation.builder()', 'slide.BlankLayout()', 'table()' method, and 'save()' function to generate and save a presentation file.",
  "flows": "Library import → Conditional check on 'USE_POLARS' → Creation of DataFrame → Building slide with table → Saving presentation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code uses a feature toggle (USE_POLARS) to decide DataFrame creation. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present. The library functions appear standard for presentation generation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'tppt' library and internal features. It conditionally creates a DataFrame with sample data if 'USE_POLARS' is True. The data is used to build a PowerPoint presentation with a table showing fruit prices and quantities. The process involves standard library calls for layout, table creation, and saving the presentation file. There are no external data inputs from untrusted sources, no network activity, no code injection, or suspicious code patterns. The logic appears straightforward and intended for presentation purposes only. No signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical presentation generation script with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply creates a PowerPoint with sample data. No security issues or malware are present based on the provided code.",
