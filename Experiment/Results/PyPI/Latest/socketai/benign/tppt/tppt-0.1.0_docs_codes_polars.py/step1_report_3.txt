{
  "purpose": "The code creates a PowerPoint presentation with a table displaying data about fruits, using the tppt library.",
  "sources": "Data is read from hardcoded Python dictionaries within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "The presentation is saved to a file named 'simple.pptx'.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded data is passed to the tppt library's presentation builder, which then generates and saves a PowerPoint file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code are present. The code relies on a third-party library (tppt) but does not invoke unsafe functions or perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a custom module 'tppt' and configuration flags from 'tppt._features'. It conditionally creates a DataFrame-like structure with static data, then constructs a PowerPoint presentation with a table showing this data, and finally saves it to a file. No user input, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are involved. The data is hardcoded and not derived from untrusted sources. The use of 'tppt' appears benign, and the overall logic is straightforward. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign example of generating a PowerPoint presentation from static data using the tppt library. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
