{
  "purpose": "Generate a PowerPoint presentation with a table displaying sample data using the tppt library.",
  "sources": "Imports tppt and its features; accesses predefined constants USE_POLARS, PandasDataFrame.",
  "sinks": "Creates a PandasDataFrame object, builds a presentation, saves to 'simple.pptx'.",
  "flows": "Imports data, constructs DataFrame based on USE_POLARS, builds presentation, saves file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of standard library functions and a legitimate third-party library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a presentation library (tppt), checks a configuration constant (USE_POLARS), creates a DataFrame with sample data, constructs a presentation slide with a table of this data, and saves it as a PowerPoint file. All actions are typical of document generation scripts. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. Usage of external libraries appears standard, with no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward script for generating a PowerPoint presentation with sample data. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It functions solely to create and save a presentation file.",
