  "purpose": "Generate a PowerPoint presentation with a table displaying sample data using the tppt library.",
  "sources": "Reading data from a list of dictionaries to create a DataFrame; importing modules and features from tppt.",
  "sinks": "Saving the generated presentation to a file named 'simple.pptx'.",
  "flows": "Data from the DataFrame flows into the table creation in the PowerPoint slide, then the presentation is saved to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; straightforward use of a presentation library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the tppt library and configuration flags, constructs a DataFrame with sample data, and creates a PowerPoint presentation with a table displaying this data. The presentation is then saved as a .pptx file. No external data inputs, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. The data used is static and benign. The code structure is clear and conventional for generating a presentation with sample data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign example of creating a PowerPoint presentation with a table. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on static data and saves the output locally, with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
