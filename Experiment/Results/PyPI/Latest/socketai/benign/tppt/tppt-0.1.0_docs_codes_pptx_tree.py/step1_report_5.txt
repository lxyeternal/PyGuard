{
  "purpose": "The code loads a presentation file and outputs its structure in JSON format.",
  "sources": "Reading the file 'your.pptx' via tppt.Presentation",
  "sinks": "None directly; the code only processes and outputs data without external communication",
  "flows": "Input file 'your.pptx' -> tppt.Presentation -> presentation.tree -> json.dumps -> output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard json and a third-party library tppt, then creates a Presentation object with a fixed filename 'your.pptx'. It accesses the 'tree' attribute of this object and dumps it as JSON. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. Usage appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple processing and display of a presentation file structure with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
