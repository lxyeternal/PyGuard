{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom slide layouts and a presentation using the tppt library, likely for creating a PowerPoint presentation with custom templates.",
  "sources": "Input sources include static string assignments for slide titles and content, and fixed parameters for slide text positioning.",
  "sinks": "The code writes a presentation file 'custom_slide_master.pptx' to disk, which is a legitimate file operation. No data is transmitted over network or exposed externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static string assignments into slide layout methods, ultimately resulting in file creation on disk.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present. The code relies solely on the tppt library and standard data flow for presentation creation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports datetime and tppt libraries to define custom slide layouts with placeholders. It builds a presentation object, adding slides with specified titles and content, and saves the presentation to a file named 'custom_slide_master.pptx'. All data inputs are hardcoded strings and parameters; no user input, external data sources, or network communications are involved. The code appears to perform straightforward presentation creation without any suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for creating a PowerPoint presentation with custom layouts using the tppt library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
