  "purpose": "Define custom slide layouts and create a presentation using the tppt library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for datetime and tppt; class attribute definitions; decorator and method calls for building and saving presentation.",
  "sinks": "The code ultimately writes a presentation file 'custom_slide_master.pptx'. No other data sinks or network actions are present.",
  "flows": "Class and layout definitions flow into the presentation building process, which culminates in saving a PPTX file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No use of environment variables or external data sources. No dynamic code execution or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom slide layout classes with placeholders, constructs a presentation using the tppt library's builder pattern, and saves it as a PPTX file. All operations involve standard file creation and manipulation without any network activity or malicious code. No suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a straightforward, benign script for generating a presentation with custom slide layouts. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
