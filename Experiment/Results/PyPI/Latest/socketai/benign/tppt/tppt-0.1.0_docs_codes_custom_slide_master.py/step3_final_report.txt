{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom slide layouts and a slide master for a PowerPoint presentation, then builds and saves a presentation with static content.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports 'datetime' and 'tppt' libraries and uses hardcoded strings and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "The code writes a presentation file 'custom_slide_master.pptx' to the local filesystem.",
  "flows": "The code creates slide layouts and a presentation object, then saves the presentation to disk; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward: it defines data classes for slide layouts, creates a slide master, builds a presentation with static content, and saves it locally. It does not perform network activity, handle user input, or execute dynamic code. The 'tppt' library is used as intended for presentation creation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected. The code's operations are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward script for generating a PowerPoint presentation with custom layouts. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerability. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (preferably 0).",
