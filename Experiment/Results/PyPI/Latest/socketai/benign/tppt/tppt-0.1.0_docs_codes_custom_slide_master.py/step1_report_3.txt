  "purpose": "Define custom slide layouts and create a PowerPoint presentation using the tppt library",
  "sources": "Imports the 'datetime' module and the 'tppt' library; no external input sources present",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'save' method writing to a file named 'custom_slide_master.pptx'; no untrusted data sinks or external network communication",
  "flows": "N/A — no untrusted data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries, defines data classes for slide layouts, and builds a PowerPoint presentation with static content. No input from external sources, user input, or environment variables is used. The presentation is saved locally with a fixed filename. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is evident. The use of 'tppt' appears to be a legitimate presentation library; no malicious behaviors such as data theft, code injection, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward script to generate a presentation with custom layouts, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe.",
