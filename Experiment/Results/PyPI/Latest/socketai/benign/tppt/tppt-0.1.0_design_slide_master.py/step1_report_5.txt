  "purpose": "Define classes and mechanisms for slide layout configurations with support for placeholders and metadata tracking.",
  "sources": "get_type_hints, get_args, get_origin, class attribute annotations, class initializers, property accesses.",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks or unsafe operations; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Type hints and annotations flow into placeholder detection and class attribute setting; no external data or network flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no obfuscated code patterns; no malicious side effects detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metadata-driven class system for slide layouts with placeholders, using annotations and runtime type inspection. It tracks placeholder fields via a metaclass, supports instantiation with dynamic fields, and provides a method to retrieve placeholder info or actual values. The code appears well-structured for its purpose without malicious intent. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks such as data leakage, code injection, or hidden network activity. All functionality is centered around data modeling and metadata management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, metadata-driven class structure for slide layout configurations with placeholders. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is detected.",
