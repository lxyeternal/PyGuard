  "purpose": "Defines a placeholder annotation system for slide layout classes, tracking annotated fields via a metaclass and providing functions to retrieve placeholder metadata or actual values.",
  "sources": "Type hints with Annotated, class attribute __annotations__, get_type_hints during class creation, attribute access on instances",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or external data flows are present",
  "flows": "Annotations processed in metaclass __new__, attribute retrieval in get_placeholders, attribute setting in __init__",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; straightforward use of Python features; no obfuscation or external data leaks",
  "analysis": "The code implements a safe, metadata-driven placeholder system using standard Python features. The metaclass collects placeholder annotations during class creation, storing them in __placeholders__. The base class supports instantiation with keyword arguments, setting attributes accordingly. The get_placeholders function retrieves either placeholder types (for classes) or current attribute values (for instances). Tests confirm correct behavior. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, safe implementation for managing placeholder annotations in slide layout classes. No security concerns, malware, or obfuscation are present. The assigned low risk scores are justified given the static, metadata-focused nature of the code.",
