{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for slide layouts with support for annotated placeholder fields, tracking such placeholders via a metaclass, and providing utilities to retrieve placeholder information or actual values.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class initializers, get_type_hints, get_type_hints with include_extras=True, get_origin, get_args, setattr, hasattr, get_placeholders function, instance attribute access",
  "sinks": "None present; no direct untrusted data sinks like network, file, or system commands",
  "flows": "Input data via constructor arguments flows into class attributes; placeholder annotations are processed during class creation to track placeholder fields; get_placeholders retrieves either placeholder types or actual attribute values",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns; straightforward usage of annotations and type hints",
  "analysis": "The code defines a _Placeholder class used as metadata in type annotations to mark placeholder fields. A metaclass collects these placeholder annotations during class creation, storing them in __placeholders__. The base class TpptSlideLayout supports instantiation with keyword arguments, setting attributes accordingly, and raising errors on unexpected keys. Subclasses demonstrate usage with Annotated and Placeholder types. The get_placeholders function retrieves placeholder info or actual attribute values depending on whether a class or instance is passed. The code performs standard type hint processing and class attribute management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured implementation for managing slide layout classes with placeholder annotations. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. It simply tracks and retrieves placeholder annotations and instance attribute values. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
