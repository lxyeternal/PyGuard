{
  "purpose": "Generate a PowerPoint presentation with a static table of fruit prices, names, and quantities using the 'tppt' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources; it uses hardcoded data within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects; the code only creates and saves a presentation locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the static list into the table builder, with no external data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'tppt' and constructs a presentation with a single slide containing a static table. It uses a builder pattern, with no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The data is hardcoded, and the presentation is saved locally. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate benign intent. All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static script for generating a PowerPoint presentation with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
