{
  "purpose": "The code creates a PowerPoint presentation with a single slide containing a table of fruit prices, names, and quantities.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'tppt' module, which is used to build and save the presentation.",
  "sinks": "The save() method writes the presentation to a file named 'simple.pptx'.",
  "flows": "The 'tppt' module is imported, then used to build a presentation object, add a slide with a table, and finally save the presentation to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic execution observed. No external network communication, user input handling, or code obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code leverages the 'tppt' library to programmatically construct a PowerPoint file. It specifies layout details and table data explicitly. There are no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The import appears standard, and the save operation writes a static file named 'simple.pptx'. The overall structure and content are straightforward and typical for presentation generation scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign presentation creation routine with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply generates and saves a PowerPoint file with predefined data.",
