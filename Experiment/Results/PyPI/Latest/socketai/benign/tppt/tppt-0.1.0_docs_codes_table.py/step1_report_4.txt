  "flows": "Import tppt -> build presentation -> add table -> save presentation to file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code observed. No dynamic code execution or external data fetching detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module 'tppt' presumed to be a presentation library. It constructs a presentation with a single slide containing a table with static data. The code ends with saving the presentation to a file named 'simple.pptx'. All operations are standard for document creation, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The module usage appears straightforward, with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign script for creating and saving a PowerPoint file. There are no signs of malware, malicious data leaks, or malicious network activity. It appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious use of the 'tppt' library.",
