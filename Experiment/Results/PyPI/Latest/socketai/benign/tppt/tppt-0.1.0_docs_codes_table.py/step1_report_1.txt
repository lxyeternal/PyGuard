  "flows": "The code flow is: import 'tppt' -> build slide with table -> save presentation to file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; usage appears straightforward and intended for presentation creation.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a third-party library 'tppt' to create a PowerPoint presentation with a single slide containing a table. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. The presentation is saved locally as 'simple.pptx'. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign presentation generation tool without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard use of a presentation library to generate and save a PPTX file. No indicators of malicious behavior or security threats are present.",
