  "purpose": "Create a PowerPoint presentation with a single slide containing 'Hello, World!' text positioned using Inches, then save as 'simple.pptx'.",
  "sources": "Import of 'tppt' library and 'Inches' type; use of presentation builder, slide creation, text addition, and file saving.",
  "sinks": "Writing the PPTX file 'simple.pptx' to disk.",
  "flows": "Import 'tppt' -> build presentation -> add slide with text -> save file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external data inputs. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a presentation library, constructs a presentation with one slide containing static text, and saves it locally. There are no external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The data flow is simple and well-defined. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present. The purpose is clear: generate a presentation file. The code's actions are benign, involving standard library calls for file creation and saving. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minimal filesystem write activity is typical for such scripts and does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, performing a straightforward task of creating and saving a presentation with static content. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (around 0.1) due to file writing activity. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy.",
