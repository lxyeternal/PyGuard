  "purpose": "Create a PowerPoint presentation with a single slide containing 'Hello, World!' text.",
  "sources": "Import of tppt module and its types; usage of tppt.Presentation.builder() to generate and save a presentation file.",
  "sinks": "The save method writes 'simple.pptx' to disk; no other external data outputs or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Builds presentation -> adds slide with text -> saves file to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated constructs. Usage appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a presentation library, constructs a simple PowerPoint slide with fixed text and dimensions, and saves it locally. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no hidden behavior. All operations are standard library calls for file creation and manipulation. The code's purpose seems benign and intended solely for generating a presentation.",
  "conclusion": "This code generates a simple PowerPoint presentation with static content. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
