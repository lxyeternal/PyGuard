  "purpose": "Generate a PowerPoint presentation with static formatted text using the tppt library.",
  "sources": "Static string 'Hello, World!' assigned directly to the text parameter in format_text function.",
  "sinks": "Writing the presentation file 'simple.pptx' to disk.",
  "flows": "Static text flows from the format_text function into the presentation builder, culminating in file output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no obfuscation, external data, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a presentation library, defines a function to add formatted text, then builds and saves a presentation with static content. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic data are involved. The code structure is clear, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The file output is static and controlled. No credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The security implications are minimal; the only minor point is the creation of a file, which is standard and not risky.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and intended solely for generating a presentation with static content. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
