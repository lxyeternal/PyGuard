{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception and a utility function for loading Pydantic settings with enhanced error messaging, as well as a wrapper for creating nested settings models.",
  "sources": "Reads class attributes (model_config), class instantiation, and error information from ValidationError.errors().",
  "sinks": "Raises custom exceptions with detailed error messages; no direct sinks for untrusted data or external communication found.",
  "flows": "Loads settings class -> Validates settings -> On error, constructs detailed error messages including environment variables and CLI flags.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Use of dynamic class instantiation and error message construction is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages configuration loading and error reporting. It accesses class attributes, performs validation, and formats error messages referencing environment variables and CLI options. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution observed. The error handling creates detailed messages which could be misused if error details are exposed publicly, but this is typical for debug info. No obfuscated code or malicious intent identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility for handling configuration errors in Pydantic-based settings. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It is safe, with a low security risk score.",
