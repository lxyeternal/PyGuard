  "purpose": "Define utility functions and classes for loading and handling Pydantic-based configuration settings with custom error handling and field definitions.",
  "sources": "None; the code reads class attributes and uses exception handling for validation errors.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted to external systems.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception for configuration errors, a function to load settings with detailed error reporting, and a wrapper for defining sub-model fields. The error handling extracts configuration info to guide users on missing environment variables or CLI flags. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or external network interactions are present. Usage of Pydantic for validation is standard, and no malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, secure utility for managing application settings using Pydantic, with clear error reporting. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
