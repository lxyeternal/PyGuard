{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions and classes for loading and handling Pydantic settings with enhanced error reporting.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes such as 'model_config', error details from ValidationError, and environment variables constructed from configuration.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include raising custom exceptions with detailed error messages that contain environment variable names and CLI flags, but no unsafe data handling or external system interactions are evident.",
  "flows": "Source: ValidationError.errors() -> Constructs environment variable and CLI flag names -> Raises PydanticSettingsSetupError with detailed message.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting for environment variable and CLI flag names is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns observed. The code relies on standard Pydantic mechanisms. The function name 'load_settings' with type annotations and the creation of default fields for sub-models appear conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception and functions for loading Pydantic settings with detailed error reporting that references environment variables and CLI options. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. No obfuscated code or malicious hidden logic detected. The approach to error handling is informative and safe. Usage of 'Field' for sub-model creation is standard. No external network or file system interaction is involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for handling Pydantic settings with enhanced error messages. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. No security risks are identified beyond typical configuration error reporting. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
