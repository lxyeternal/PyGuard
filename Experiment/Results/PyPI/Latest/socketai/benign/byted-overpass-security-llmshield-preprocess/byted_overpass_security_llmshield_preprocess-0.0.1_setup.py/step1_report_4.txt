  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with metadata, dependencies, and description.",
  "sources": "The open() function reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data is propagated or used in a dangerous context.",
  "flows": "The file reads 'README.md' to include long description, which is a benign operation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The long_description read from a file is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata, including name, version, packages, description, long description read from README.md, author info, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirement. The only notable operation is reading the README.md file, which is a common and safe practice. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation that could be malicious is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions solely to define package metadata.",
