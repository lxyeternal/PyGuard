  "purpose": "Defines a placeholder Python package setup configuration to mitigate dependency confusion risks.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Reads file content for description, but does not process untrusted data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and configuration. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, which is a common practice and not suspicious. There are no external network connections, no code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no unusual constructs. All code appears to be boilerplate setup for a Python package with a clear purpose to serve as a placeholder for dependency management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions as a package metadata definition and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
