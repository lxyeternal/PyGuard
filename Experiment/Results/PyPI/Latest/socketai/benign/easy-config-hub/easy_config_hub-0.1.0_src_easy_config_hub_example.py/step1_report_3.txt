{
  "purpose": "Define a structured application configuration with multiple nested settings for version, modes, image downloading, UI, and scrolling parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (multiprocessing, config, setting), and defines default values for various settings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; no data is processed or transmitted, and no untrusted input is handled within this code.",
  "flows": "The code establishes configuration settings with default values and metadata, without any data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code primarily defines static configuration parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines nested configuration classes with default settings, and uses static data structures like dictionaries and simple data types. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. No obfuscation, malicious functions, or suspicious logic detected. The code appears to be a standard configuration setup without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration class structure for an application. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. It is safe and intended for setting application parameters.",
