  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard configuration setup with no malicious intent, no obfuscated code, and no security risks.\n- The code only defines configuration classes with default values, nested structures, and metadata.\n- No external data flows, network operations, file writes, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The use of 'multiprocessing.cpu_count()' is benign and used solely for setting thread counts.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or anomalies are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, which seems reasonable given the static configuration nature.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- The reports are very consistent and do not raise any red flags. They do not challenge the benign nature of the code, nor do they identify any subtle vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.\n- The only dynamic aspect is the retrieval of CPU count, which is standard practice and not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code appears to be purely a configuration module with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned by all reports seem appropriate and reasonable.\n- No modifications or higher risk scores are justified based on the provided code and reports.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, standard, and free of malicious content.",
