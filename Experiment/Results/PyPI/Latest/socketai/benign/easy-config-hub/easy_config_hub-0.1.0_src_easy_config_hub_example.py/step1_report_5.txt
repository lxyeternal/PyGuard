  "purpose": "Define application configuration settings for various components such as general app info, image downloading, UI, and scrolling, with structured levels and types.",
  "sources": "Configuration class attributes, imported modules (multiprocessing), and class variables",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or data flows to external systems",
  "flows": "Configuration definitions are static and do not process external input; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Use of multiprocessing.cpu_count() is standard; no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines configuration classes with type annotations and default values. It utilizes the multiprocessing module to determine CPU count for setting max_threads. No external input handling, network activity, or file operations are present. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior identified. The structure appears to be a straightforward configuration schema with nested classes and settings, adhering to typical patterns. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for an application with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured, with no suspicious code or data flows.",
