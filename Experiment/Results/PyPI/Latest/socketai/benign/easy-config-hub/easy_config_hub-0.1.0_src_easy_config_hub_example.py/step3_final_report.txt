{
  "purpose": "This code defines nested configuration classes with default values, metadata, and type annotations for an application, without performing any runtime actions or external data handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules ('config', 'setting') and uses 'multiprocessing.cpu_count()' to determine thread count.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static configuration setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured configuration module defining default settings with metadata. It imports standard modules and uses safe practices like 'multiprocessing.cpu_count()'. No dynamic or external operations are present. The code lacks any malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. All signals indicate benign intent, with no vulnerabilities or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports correctly assess it as safe, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk. No modifications are necessary.",
