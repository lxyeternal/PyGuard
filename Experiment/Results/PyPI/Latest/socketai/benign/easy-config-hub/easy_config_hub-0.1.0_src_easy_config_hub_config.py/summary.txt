  "conclusion": "The code is a transparent, standard configuration management utility with no malicious intent. The primary security consideration is validating file paths and external data inputs to prevent directory traversal or data corruption. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.2–0.3 due to unvalidated inputs, but no malicious activity is detected."
