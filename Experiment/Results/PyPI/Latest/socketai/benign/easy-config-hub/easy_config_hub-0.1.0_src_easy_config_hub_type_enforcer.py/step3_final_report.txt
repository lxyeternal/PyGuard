{
  "purpose": "The code implements a runtime type enforcement utility that validates and parses values according to specified type annotations, supporting complex types and unions.",
  "sources": "Type hints via get_type_hints, __orig_class__ attribute during class declaration, input values provided during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "None external; internal validation and parsing only, no data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input values are checked and potentially parsed during __set_name__, with validation flows from source inputs through _check_type and _parse_check_type methods, culminating in type enforcement or exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no external data leaks, and no network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs type validation and parsing for simple and complex types, including unions, lists, sets, and dictionaries. It uses standard Python type inspection functions and handles errors gracefully. No external side effects, network calls, or malicious behaviors are present. The logic is straightforward, focusing solely on type enforcement, with no signs of sabotage or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard runtime type validation utility with no malicious intent or suspicious features. It poses minimal security risk and is free from obfuscation. The existing reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1).",
