  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static greeting string, with no external data, inputs, or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function returns a static string directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward function returning a fixed string with no external interactions, dynamic behavior, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and clarity support these assessments. No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present, and the scores are consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
