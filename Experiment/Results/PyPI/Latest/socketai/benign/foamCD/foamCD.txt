The detection methods are pattern-based and read-only, with no external or system-altering operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are accurate and justified."

The low malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The risk score of approximately 0.1-0.2 accounts for potential markdown injection if untrusted data is later rendered insecurely. Overall, supply chain security appears sound."

The fallback mechanisms are safe. Overall, the code exhibits no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The minor external plugin risk can be mitigated by trusting plugin sources."
