{
  "purpose": "This code provides a comprehensive set of feature detectors for analyzing C++ code features using the Clang CIndex library, primarily for feature detection and language version identification.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (logging, typing) and the 'clang.cindex' module; references to class attributes and method parameters; access to cursor properties such as kind, spelling, semantic_parent, and get_children().",
  "sinks": "Detection logic relies on string matching within tokens, token spellings, and cursor properties; no apparent sinks that execute untrusted data or perform harmful operations.",
  "flows": "Source inputs are token strings, cursor kinds, and code tokens; detection flows involve pattern matching, token analysis, and cursor property checks; no data flows leading to unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extensive and appears to be purely analytical without any code that writes, executes, or transmits data. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are evident. The code structure is complex but consistent with feature detection logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines numerous feature detector classes that analyze C++ code features based on cursor properties, tokens, and string patterns. The detectors perform pattern matching, token inspection, and cursor attribute analysis to identify language features or constructs. The registry manages and runs these detectors. All logic is read-only, pattern-based, and focused on feature detection, with no code execution, network communication, or data manipulation involved. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or security risks are detected in the implementation. The inclusion of extensive pattern matching and cursor property checks aligns with benign static analysis functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static feature detection framework for C++ code analysis, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It is designed for feature detection and classification, not for executing or transmitting untrusted data. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or sabotage indicators are present.",
