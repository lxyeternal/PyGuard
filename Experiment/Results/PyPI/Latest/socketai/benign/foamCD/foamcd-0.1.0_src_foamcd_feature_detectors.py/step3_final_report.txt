{
  "purpose": "The code implements a static analysis framework for detecting various C++ language features, attributes, and constructs using libclang's AST and token analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from clang AST cursors, tokens, and token strings during feature detection.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects; the code only performs pattern matching and logging.",
  "flows": "The data flows from source cursors and tokens through pattern matching functions to detection results; no external data or system modifications occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present; the code is straightforward and pattern-based.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of pattern-matching classes that analyze clang AST cursors and tokens for specific C++ features. It uses standard read-only operations, such as inspecting cursor kinds, token strings, and token sequences. There are no indications of malicious behavior, external communication, or data manipulation. The detection relies on pattern matching, token analysis, and cursor properties, all of which are read-only and safe. The extensive use of logging is for debugging and transparency, not malicious purposes. The overall structure is clear, and no suspicious or malicious code segments are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured static analysis utility for detecting C++ language features. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The detection methods are pattern-based and read-only, with no external or system-altering operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are accurate and justified.",
