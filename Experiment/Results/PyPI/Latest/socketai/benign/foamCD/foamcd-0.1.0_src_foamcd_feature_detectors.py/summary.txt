  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured static analysis utility for detecting C++ language features. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The detection methods are pattern-based and read-only, with no external or system-altering operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are accurate and justified."
