{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of feature detectors for analyzing C++/DSL code features and a registry system to manage and run these detectors using the clang.cindex library.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'cursor' object (representing code structure), 'token_spellings' (list of tokens), 'token_str' (token string), and 'available_cursor_kinds' (list of cursor kinds). These are derived from parsing source code via libclang.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include logging functions (logger.debug/warning) and attribute detection logic; no sinks directly perform system calls, network communication, or data exfiltration. No evidence of data leaks or untrusted data handling outside of logging.",
  "flows": "Data flows from parsing code structures (cursor, tokens) through detection logic in each detector, resulting in detection flags. These flags are aggregated by the registry's 'detect_features' method. No malicious flow pathways identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a comprehensive set of feature detectors for C++ features. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Logging is used for debugging, not malicious purposes. No network operations, file modifications, or other malicious actions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically defines multiple feature detector classes, each tailored to detect specific C++ features based on code structure and tokens. The registry class manages registration and detection processes. No parts of the code perform unsafe or malicious operations; it solely analyzes code features. There are no indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or malicious behavior within this code segment. The extensive use of logging is for debugging and transparency, not for data exfiltration or stealth operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, purpose-specific implementation of feature detection for C++ code analysis. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The code's structure and logic are consistent with an analysis tool, with no harmful or malicious intent evident.",
