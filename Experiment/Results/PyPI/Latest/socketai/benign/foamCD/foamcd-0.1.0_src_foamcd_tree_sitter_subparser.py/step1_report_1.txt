{
  "purpose": "A fallback parser for extracting C++ code structure, especially for unit tests, using Tree-sitter when libclang fails.",
  "sources": "File input read via 'open(filepath, 'rb')' in parse_file and find_test_cases methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leaks identified; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere or used in dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "File content is read from disk and parsed into a syntax tree; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code processes input files for parsing purposes only. No obfuscated code or malicious intent apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static analysis of C++ source files using Tree-sitter, with thorough parsing and extraction functions. It includes fallback mechanisms for missing dependencies and robust error handling with logging. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network activity. The code operates locally on input files and does not interact with external systems or perform harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign code analysis tool designed for parsing C++ files to extract structural information, especially for unit testing. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks present in this implementation.",
