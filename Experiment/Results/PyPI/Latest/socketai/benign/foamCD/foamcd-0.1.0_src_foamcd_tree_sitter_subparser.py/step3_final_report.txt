  "purpose": "Static parser for C++ source files to extract classes, functions, and test cases, primarily used as a fallback when libclang cannot parse a file.",
  "sources": "Reads source files from disk using open(filepath, 'rb')",
  "sinks": "No external network activity, no data exfiltration, no system modifications",
  "flows": "File content -> parse with Tree-sitter -> extract classes/functions/test cases -> return data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or malicious code, only incomplete implementation (TODOs)",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis of C++ files, reading source code, parsing with Tree-sitter, and extracting structural information such as classes, functions, and test cases. It includes error handling and logging, with no network activity or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 accounts for file reading operations but does not indicate any threat. The code's purpose and implementation are benign and standard for static analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static analysis utility for C++ source files with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
