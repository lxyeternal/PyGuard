  "purpose": "Configure logging with optional colored output for a Python application",
  "sources": "Importing colorlog module, calling setup_logging function",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers output to console; no untrusted data sinks identified",
  "flows": "Input parameters (verbose) influence logging level; import checks influence formatter choice",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behavior; only standard logging setup",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logger named 'foamCD' with configurable verbosity. It attempts to import 'colorlog' for colored output and falls back to standard formatting if unavailable. No external data sources, user input, or untrusted data flows are processed. The code is straightforward, configuring a logger with typical patterns, without any suspicious or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard logging setup without any malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not contain anomalies or malware.",
