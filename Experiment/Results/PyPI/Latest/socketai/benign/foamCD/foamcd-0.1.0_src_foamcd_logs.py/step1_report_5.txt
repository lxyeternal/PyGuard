  "purpose": "Set up logging with optional colored output for a Python application.",
  "sources": "Import statements, function parameters, and local imports within setup_logging.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send untrusted data to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'verbose' influences log level; import success influences formatter choice.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. Code performs standard logging setup with optional color support.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and optionally colorlog. It defines a function to configure logging with different formats based on the presence of colorlog. The function manages handlers cleanly, sets log levels based on verbosity, and applies appropriate formatters. No user input handling, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard logging setup routine with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
