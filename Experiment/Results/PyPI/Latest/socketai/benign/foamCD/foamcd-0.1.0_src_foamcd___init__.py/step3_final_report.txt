  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, hardcoded URLs, dynamic code execution (exec/eval), network/file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, data exfiltration points, system modifications, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input/read sources to dangerous functions (exec/eval), hardcoded URLs, or network sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec/eval with untrusted data, hardcoded URLs, obfuscated code structure, dynamic code execution, suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high suspicion if it uses exec/eval with untrusted input, contains hardcoded URLs, or shows obfuscation. Benign code lacks such patterns. The presence of dangerous functions and obfuscation increases malware and security risk scores. No malicious code detected in benign samples. The analysis aligns with the scoring, with high scores justified in suspicious cases and low scores in benign ones.",
  "conclusion": "The most suspicious code (Report 3) demonstrates behaviors indicative of malicious intent, warranting high malware (0.8) and security risk (0.85) scores, with moderate obfuscation (0.6). Benign reports are correctly scored with zero or low values. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the code behaviors described.",
