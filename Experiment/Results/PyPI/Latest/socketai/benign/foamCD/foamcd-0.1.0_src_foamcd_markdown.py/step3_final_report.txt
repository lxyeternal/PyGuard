  "purpose": "Generate markdown documentation from foamCD database, source code, and git info",
  "sources": "Reads from SQLite databases, filesystem, git repositories, configuration files",
  "sinks": "File I/O, database queries, git commands, templating",
  "flows": "Database queries to filesystem and git data, then to markdown files",
  "anomalies": "Potential markdown injection if untrusted data is incorporated into output without sanitization",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive documentation generator that interacts with trusted data sources and writes markdown files with frontmatter. It uses standard libraries and external tools (git, frontmatter, jinja2). No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is detected. The main security concern is unvalidated data leading to markdown injection, but this is a known and manageable risk, not malware. The code structure is clear, with no suspicious patterns or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured documentation generator with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The risk score of approximately 0.1-0.2 accounts for potential markdown injection if untrusted data is later rendered insecurely. Overall, supply chain security appears sound.",
