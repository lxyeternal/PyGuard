  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured documentation generator with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The risk score of approximately 0.1-0.2 accounts for potential markdown injection if untrusted data is later rendered insecurely. Overall, supply chain security appears sound."
