  "purpose": "The code manages plugin detection and registration for feature detectors and custom entity fields, including plugin discovery, loading, and execution of detection logic.",
  "sources": "Reads plugin files from specified directories, inspects and loads Python modules, and accesses class attributes and methods within those modules.",
  "sinks": "Calls exec_module to execute plugin code, inspects classes and their attributes, and invokes detector methods during feature detection.",
  "flows": "Loads plugin files via importlib, inspects classes inheriting from FeatureDetector, registers detectors and custom fields, and executes detector.detect during feature analysis.",
  "anomalies": "Uses importlib to dynamically load arbitrary Python files, which could potentially include malicious code. No explicit validation or sandboxing is performed on plugin code. The code does not sanitize or restrict plugin content beyond skipping special files and checking class inheritance. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious API calls are evident. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically loads plugin files from specified directories using importlib, then inspects modules for classes inheriting from FeatureDetector. These plugins are registered unless disabled or not whitelisted. The dynamic import allows execution of arbitrary plugin code, which could be malicious if untrusted plugins are present. The code does not validate or sandbox plugin content beyond standard Python import, potentially enabling malicious behavior if a plugin contains harmful code. During feature detection, plugin methods are invoked directly, which could execute malicious payloads if the plugin code is malicious. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration code, but the dynamic import mechanism inherently presents a supply chain risk if malicious plugins are introduced. The overall structure and logic are typical for plugin management but rely heavily on the trustworthiness of plugin sources. No obfuscated code, malware, or suspicious network activity is directly observed in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code manages plugin discovery, loading, and feature detection via dynamic imports, which inherently poses supply chain risks if malicious plugins are introduced. There are no overt signs of malicious intent or backdoors within this code itself, but the use of importlib to execute arbitrary plugin files can be exploited if plugins are compromised. Proper validation, sandboxing, or signature verification is absent, increasing the risk of executing malicious code from untrusted sources.",
