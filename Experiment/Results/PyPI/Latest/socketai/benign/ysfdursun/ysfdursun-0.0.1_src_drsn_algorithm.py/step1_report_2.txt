  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly clear due to lack of comments or descriptive variable names, but it appears to involve some form of data processing or network communication.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, configuration files, or user inputs (though not explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, file writes, or system commands if present; however, these are not explicitly shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment/config/user input) to processing functions, possibly ending at network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; no obfuscated code features present; no suspicious or malicious functions evident from the visible code.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks specific input/output operations or suspicious behavior. It mainly consists of standard data processing constructs. Without external context or hidden code, no malicious activity is apparent. No unusual language features or obfuscation are present. The overall structure appears typical of benign Python scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, benign Python script without malicious behavior.",
