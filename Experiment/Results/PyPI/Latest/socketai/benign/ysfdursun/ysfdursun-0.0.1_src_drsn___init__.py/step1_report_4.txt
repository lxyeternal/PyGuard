  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a certain data processing or utility function, but without additional context or comments, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'input_data' variable, environment variables, and possibly external modules or files depending on the implementation details.",
  "sinks": "Data can flow into output functions, network communication (if present), or system calls, which could lead to data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as 'input_data' or environment variables through various functions or operations and may reach sinks such as output statements, network calls, or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments detected. The code contains typical patterns but lacks comments or documentation that could clarify intent. The use of dynamic features or obscure patterns was not evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to handle input data and environment variables. There are no signs of code injection, unsafe SQL, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code structure seems standard without obfuscation, although lack of comments makes it harder to interpret intent fully. No suspicious network activity, cryptominers, or system damage code was found. The code does not include any hidden backdoors or malicious functions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks within this code snippet. The code is straightforward, and no malicious patterns are evident. The overall security risk is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
