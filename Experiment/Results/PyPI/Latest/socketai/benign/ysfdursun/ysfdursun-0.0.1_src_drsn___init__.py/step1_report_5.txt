  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script performing some data processing or utility functions. No explicit malicious intent is evident from the visible code snippets.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules. Specific data sources are not explicitly detailed due to lack of code context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but no suspicious or insecure operations are clearly present from the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, with no indication of untrusted data reaching sensitive system calls or network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated sections are apparent. The code structure appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or incomplete, lacking suspicious patterns or risky behaviors. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious by itself. No signs of data leakage, insecure coding practices, or malicious backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with standard data handling practices. However, the limited context prevents absolute certainty.",
