  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions, but the specific intent is unclear without detailed examination.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, possibly from user input or configuration files; uses imported modules and functions as data sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via print statements or writes to files; may send data over network sockets or APIs if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input functions through internal processing functions to output or external communication points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs observed; no obfuscated code detected; no suspicious network activity or hidden functions evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard libraries and functions. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or reverse shells detected. It processes data within normal bounds, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Absence of dangerous constructs like unsafe eval, insecure SQL, or hidden network communication points. The code structure suggests typical functionality without malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no indicators of supply chain attacks or malware. However, the analysis is limited to the visible code and does not account for external dependencies or runtime behaviors.",
