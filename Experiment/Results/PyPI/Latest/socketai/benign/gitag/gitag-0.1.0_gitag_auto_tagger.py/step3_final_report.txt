  "purpose": "Automates Git version tagging, changelog generation, and optional push of tags.",
  "sources": "Commit messages, latest tags, user parameters (pre, build), external modules (git_repo, version_manager, changelog_writer).",
  "sinks": "Git repository (creating/pushing tags), changelog file, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Commit messages and tags flow into version bumping, which then triggers Git operations and logging; user parameters influence versioning and changelog generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or network activity; external modules assumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of release automation, involving version bumping, tagging, changelog creation, and logging. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. External dependencies are standard for such workflows. The logic is clear, and data flows are typical for version management tools. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious intent. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal threat beyond standard repository modifications. Confidence is high (1), given the code's clarity and the absence of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard automation tool for Git tagging and changelog management with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
