  "purpose": "Manage Git repository operations such as remote configuration, fetching tags, retrieving commit messages, and creating tags within CI/CD pipelines.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (GH_TOKEN, GITHUB_TOKEN, GITHUB_REPOSITORY), subprocess calls executing git commands, user input indirectly via environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Git subprocess commands that modify repository state, push tags, or fetch data; potential data leaks if environment variables are compromised.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide tokens and repo info → subprocess commands perform git operations → repository state changes or data retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. Use of environment variables is standard but relies on environment security.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard git operations via subprocess, utilizing environment variables for authentication. Error handling is appropriate, and no malicious or obfuscated code is present. The reliance on environment variables is typical in CI/CD but could be a risk if the environment is compromised. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent and justified based on the code's behavior and context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, straightforward, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score reflects standard CI/CD environment reliance rather than actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe for use, with no supply chain security concerns.",
