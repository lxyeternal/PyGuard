  "purpose": "Validate configuration dictionary for correct types and values.",
  "sources": "Input dictionary 'config' parameter, especially keys: 'prefix', 'suffix', 'version_pattern', 'patterns'.",
  "sinks": "Error messages appended to the 'errors' list; no data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input 'config' is checked for types and value correctness; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code performs straightforward validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs type and value validation on a configuration dictionary, checking keys for correct data types and valid values against an enumeration. It imports 'BumpLevel' for validation, but only uses it for membership checks. All operations are standard validation logic. No external data access, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration validator with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It only performs data validation and error reporting without any harmful side effects.",
