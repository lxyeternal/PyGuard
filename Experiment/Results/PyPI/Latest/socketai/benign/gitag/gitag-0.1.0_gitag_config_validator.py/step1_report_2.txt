  "purpose": "Validate a configuration dictionary for correct data types and valid values, specifically checking for string types, dictionary structures, and valid bump level keys.",
  "sources": "Configuration data provided as input parameter 'config'",
  "sinks": "None directly, as no data is sent externally or written to files/network in this code",
  "flows": "Input 'config' is checked and processed locally; no external data flow or untrusted data handling beyond validation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious or unusual code constructs, and no evidence of obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation checks on the provided dictionary 'config'. It verifies data types for 'prefix', 'suffix', and 'version_pattern', ensuring they are strings. For the 'patterns' key, it checks that the value is a dictionary, then iterates through each key-value pair, confirming the key is a valid bump level and the value is a list of strings. There are no network calls, file operations, or data leaks, and no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage. Usage of 'BumpLevel.__members__' assumes proper enum validation without risky behavior. Overall, the code is straightforward input validation with no malicious or security-compromising actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical validation function with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. It performs expected type and value checks on the input configuration. There are no indicators of malicious intent or backdoors.",
