{
  "purpose": "Validate a configuration dictionary for correctness and proper types, specifically checking for string fields and valid patterns based on predefined bump levels.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameter 'config' and accesses its keys such as 'prefix', 'suffix', 'version_pattern', and 'patterns'.",
  "sinks": "The function does not write untrusted data or perform any network or system operations. It only accumulates error messages.",
  "flows": "The data flows from 'config' input through conditional checks, with pattern values being validated against the BumpLevel.__members__ enumeration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs straightforward validation logic. It imports 'BumpLevel' but only uses its members for validation, which is safe.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a configuration class and uses type checking and enumeration validation to verify the correctness of the config dictionary. It checks string types for specific keys and validates patterns against known bump levels. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration validation routine with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply verifies input types and values against expected enums, with no network or data leakage functions.",
