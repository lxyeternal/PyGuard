  "purpose": "Validate configuration dictionary keys and values, ensuring correct types and values against predefined bump levels.",
  "sources": "Keys in the config dict: 'prefix', 'suffix', 'version_pattern', 'patterns'; 'patterns' dict keys and values; import of BumpLevel for validation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; validation errors are appended to errors list, no external data flow or untrusted data handling beyond local checks.",
  "flows": "Input config dict -> validation checks -> errors list; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward validation logic, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs type and value validation on a configuration dictionary, checking optional keys for correct types, and validating 'patterns' keys against BumpLevel enum members. It ensures 'patterns' is a dict with keys matching enum members and values as lists of strings. No external data access, code execution, or obfuscation is present. The logic is standard and safe, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard validation routine with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), all consistent with the code's behavior.",
