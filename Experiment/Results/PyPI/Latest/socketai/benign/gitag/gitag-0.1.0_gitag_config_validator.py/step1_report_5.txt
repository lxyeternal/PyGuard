{
  "purpose": "Validate configuration dictionary for correctness of certain keys and their value types, including pattern validation against predefined bump levels.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'config' dictionary, accessing keys 'prefix', 'suffix', 'version_pattern', and 'patterns'. It also accesses 'BumpLevel.__members__' for validation.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send data over the network, write to files, or execute system commands. It performs only in-memory validation.",
  "flows": "The code reads configuration data and compares 'patterns' keys against BumpLevel members. It does not process untrusted external input beyond the initial 'config' dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The validation logic appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard input validation for a configuration dictionary, ensuring types are correct and that pattern keys match predefined bump levels. It uses a static reference 'BumpLevel.__members__' for validation, which is a safe operation assuming 'BumpLevel' is a typical Enum. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, code execution, or data exfiltration. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed. The code's behavior is predictable and solely validation-based.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration validation routine with no malicious intent. It only checks data types and keys against expected values, with no signs of malware or malicious actions.",
