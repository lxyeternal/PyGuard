{
  "purpose": "Defines enumerations, constants, and regex patterns related to version bumping, merging strategies, and semantic versioning for a software release process.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, input reading, or user data handling observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network operations, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows or untrusted data processing pathways.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily consists of enum definitions, regex patterns, and static data structures with no apparent unusual or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured enums for bump levels and merge strategies, along with predefined keywords and regex patterns for semantic versioning and commit message analysis. It appears to be a configuration module for version management. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic is present. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or data leakage points are found. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical software versioning practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a static configuration setup for versioning and release management, with no indicators of malware, backdoors, or security threats.",
