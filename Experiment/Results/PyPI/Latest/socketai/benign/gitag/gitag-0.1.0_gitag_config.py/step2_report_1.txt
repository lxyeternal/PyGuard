  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, declarative, and contains only enums, constants, and regex patterns.\n- No external data, input handling, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: configuration for version bumping, commit message parsing, and semantic versioning.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and logically consistent.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Security risks:** No external data handling, no code execution, no data leaks.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, purely declarative, and intended for version management tooling.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The scores are consistent with the code's static, configuration nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n\n- No issues are present that would justify a higher malware or risk score.\n- The regex patterns are standard for semantic versioning and commit message conventions.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly states the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0**  \n  - Obfuscated: **0**  \n  - Risk: **0**\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  The code is purely static configuration data with no behavior that could be malicious or risky. The regex patterns are standard and do not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. No modifications to the scores are necessary. The code is safe, well-structured, and intended for version management purposes.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**            | **0**      |\n\nThis aligns with the provided analysis and the nature of the code.",
