  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, declarative, and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums for bump levels and merge strategies, regex patterns for semantic versioning and commit message conventions, and constants for default levels and keywords. It contains no external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The regex patterns are standard and do not pose security risks. The code is purely declarative configuration intended for version management tooling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended for versioning purposes. All signals indicate no malicious intent or security risk.",
