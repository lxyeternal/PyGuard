  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, static configuration data defining enums, regex patterns, and constants for versioning and commit message parsing.\n- No external input, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's static, declarative nature.\n- The security risk score is also 0, consistent with the absence of external interactions or sensitive data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- The code appears to be purely declarative configuration, with no issues to detect or confirm as malicious.\n- No logic errors, flaws, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The regex patterns are standard for semantic versioning and commit message conventions.\n- The enum definitions and constants are straightforward and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code does not contain any issues that need correction or further scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n### Review of scores and reasoning:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Security risk scores:** All are 0, consistent with the static configuration.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Confidence scores:** All are 1, reflecting high certainty that the code is safe.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes, they are. The code is simple, static, and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Potential discrepancies or suggestions:\n\n- Since the code is purely declarative, any higher scores for malware or obfuscation would be unjustified.\n- The reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven all the evidence, I would **agree with the current scores**. The code is safe, and the risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The confidence remains high.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThese match the current assessments and are justified by the static, configuration-only nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scoring. No changes needed.",
