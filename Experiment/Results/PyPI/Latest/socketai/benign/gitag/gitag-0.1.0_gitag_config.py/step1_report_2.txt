  "purpose": "Define enumerations and default configurations for version bumping, merging strategies, and semantic versioning patterns in a version control or release management tool.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; only static definitions and constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing beyond static data definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of enum class definitions, constant lists, and regex patterns. All are standard Python constructs for configuration purposes. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no code execution based on external data. The regex patterns are for pattern matching versioning and commit messages, typical in release automation scripts. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs. It does not interact with the network, files, or sensitive data. No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, defining enums, constants, and regex patterns for versioning and commit message parsing. It does not contain any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security concerns are identified.",
