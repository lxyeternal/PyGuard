  "purpose": "Define enumerations and default patterns/keywords related to version bumping and semantic versioning for a changelog or release management system.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, class methods, and data structures. No external input or untrusted sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to security issues or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted data from sources to sinks. The code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums and constants for versioning strategies, with regex patterns for commit messages and semantic versioning. All constructs are static and serve configuration purposes. There are no input handling, external data processing, or code execution features that could be exploited. The code appears to be straightforward data definitions without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module that defines enums, constants, and regex patterns for version management. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified. It is safe and intended for standard use.",
