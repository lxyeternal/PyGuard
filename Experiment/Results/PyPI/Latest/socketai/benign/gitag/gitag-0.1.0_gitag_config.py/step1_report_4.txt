  "purpose": "Defines enumerations, constants, and regex patterns for version bumping and semantic versioning in a code management tool.",
  "sources": "Constants, enum classes, regex patterns, and list definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data input or output operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from regex patterns and enum values used internally; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of enum definitions, constant lists, and regex patterns for semantic versioning and commit message parsing. No external input handling, no network operations, and no data leaks are present. The code appears to be a configuration or utility module for version management, with no malicious behavior or suspicious logic. The regex patterns are standard for commit message conventions and semantic versioning, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious obfuscation techniques.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign configuration and utility module for versioning purposes, with no indications of malware or malicious intent. It is safe for use in its described context.",
