  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely declarative, consisting of enums, constants, and regex patterns for versioning, commit message parsing, and release management.\n- No external input, data processing, or code execution is present.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected.\n- The code appears to be a configuration module used in versioning tools or release pipelines.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious or security issues.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or mistakes?**  \n  **None detected.** The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to standard practices for defining enums and regex patterns.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the code being clear and static.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not introduce any security risk.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- Since all reports assign 0, and the code is static configuration, there is no reason to increase the risk score.\n\n### Claims Based on Assumptions:\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all analyses correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is a standard configuration module for versioning, with no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security concerns.\n- The regex patterns are typical for semantic versioning and commit message conventions.\n- The enums and constants are static and do not involve any dynamic or unsafe operations.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, static code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is a benign, static configuration module for versioning and release management, with no security concerns or malware risks.",
