  "purpose": "Define enumerations and constants for version bumping, merge strategies, and semantic versioning patterns in a software version management tool.",
  "sources": "None; the code defines static classes, constants, and regex patterns; it does not read external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there are no data inputs or processing beyond static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code consists of straightforward enum and constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides enum classes for bump levels and merge strategies, lists default levels, and sets default regex patterns for commit keywords and semantic versioning. It uses only standard library modules and static regex patterns. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or data manipulations. The code is purely declarative with no signs of malicious activity or complex behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static definitions related to version management, with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger tool for versioning or changelog management, with no indicators of malware or security issues.",
