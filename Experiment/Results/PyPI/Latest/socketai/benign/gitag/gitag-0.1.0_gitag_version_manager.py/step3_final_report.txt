  "purpose": "Configuration-driven version management utility that loads settings from local files, applies regex patterns to commit messages for bump level detection, and updates version strings accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files (pyproject.toml, default_pyproject.toml), loads regex patterns, and commit message strings.",
  "sinks": "Pattern matching on commit messages; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from files into regex pattern matching functions; commit messages are processed through regex-based strategy functions to determine bump levels.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs detected. Regex patterns are loaded from external configs, which could be manipulated if untrusted, but handled safely with fallback and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code safely loads configuration files, with fallback defaults, and applies regex patterns for commit message analysis. Exception handling is in place for file I/O and regex errors. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or malicious patterns are present. The regex patterns are used responsibly, with fallbacks, and the overall structure is transparent and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation for version bumping based on commit messages and configuration files. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by reliance on external configuration files which could be manipulated if untrusted.",
