      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The setup script appears benign and standard. The primary security concern is the implementation of 'show_farewell' in 'trigger_farewell.py'. Without inspecting that code, the package can be considered low risk, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The security risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects cautious suspicion due to the potential for malicious code in the referenced function. Further review of 'trigger_farewell.py' is recommended to confirm safety."

      "conclusion": "The script is a benign multimedia farewell presentation with no malicious intent or security risks. It relies on local media files and displays messages without any suspicious or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed show no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are justified, and the overall security posture is minimal risk. For empty or incomplete code, setting malware and obfuscated scores to 0 and risk to 0 is appropriate. The assessments across reports are consistent and accurate."
