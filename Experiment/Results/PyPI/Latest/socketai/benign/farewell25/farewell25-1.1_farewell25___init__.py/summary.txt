  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed show no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are justified, and the overall security posture is minimal risk. For empty or incomplete code, setting malware and obfuscated scores to 0 and risk to 0 is appropriate. The assessments across reports are consistent and accurate."
