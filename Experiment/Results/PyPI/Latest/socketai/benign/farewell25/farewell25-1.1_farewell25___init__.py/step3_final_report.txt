  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the open source dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user input, external files, and network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network connections, file writes, environment variable access, and data output points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) to sinks (e.g., network, files), but no explicit flows are present due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is either empty or minimal with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence or incompleteness of code, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the lack of malicious code. Security risk scores are low (around 0.2), reflecting cautious assessment due to incomplete or placeholder code. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited information. No evidence suggests malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed show no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are justified, and the overall security posture is minimal risk. For empty or incomplete code, setting malware and obfuscated scores to 0 and risk to 0 is appropriate. The assessments across reports are consistent and accurate.",
