  "purpose": "Display a farewell message with graphical background and music, and output messages in the console.",
  "sources": "Reading image file 'farewell.png' and music file 'farewell.mp3' from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "pygame.mixer.music.load() and pygame.image.load() functions loading external media files.",
  "flows": "Filesystem paths are used to load media files which are then played or displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The code simply loads local media files and displays messages.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes pygame, loads an image and music from the local filesystem, displays graphical content, plays music, and outputs text in the console. There are no untrusted input sources, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The media files are loaded from the local directory and are used solely for display purposes. The script terminates after a fixed time, with no hidden or malicious actions observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a graphical and audio display of a farewell message without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It solely loads local media files for presentation, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
