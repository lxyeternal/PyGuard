{
  "purpose": "Display a farewell message both visually via a graphical window with an image and music, and in the console.",
  "sources": "Reading image file 'farewell.png', reading music file 'farewell.mp3'.",
  "sinks": "Loading and playing music, displaying an image, printing to console.",
  "flows": "Image and music files are loaded at startup; console farewell message is printed; graphical display shows image and text; music plays in the background.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; standard use of pygame for multimedia; no hardcoded credentials, no network communication, no data leaks, no code obfuscation, no dynamic code execution or external input handling beyond static file access.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes pygame and loads static multimedia resources (image and music) from the local filesystem. It then displays a graphical window with the background image and some text, while simultaneously printing farewell messages to the console. Music is played in a loop. The process concludes with a pause and program termination. All operations are standard multimedia presentation and do not involve any external network communication, data collection, or malicious behavior. There are no hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a multimedia farewell presentation with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It uses standard library features for multimedia and file access without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
