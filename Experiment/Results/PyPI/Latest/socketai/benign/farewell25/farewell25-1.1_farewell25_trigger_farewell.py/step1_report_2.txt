{
  "purpose": "Display a farewell graphical message with background image and music, along with console farewell messages.",
  "sources": "File system for image ('farewell.png') and music ('farewell.mp3') loading, standard input for script execution.",
  "sinks": "pygame.mixer.music.load and play (loading and playing music), console print statements, image rendering on display.",
  "flows": "Code loads image and music from filesystem -> initializes pygame -> displays background and text -> plays music -> keeps window open for 10 seconds.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior; standard use of pygame for multimedia display, no hardcoded credentials or network activity, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes pygame, loads media assets from local files, displays a farewell message both visually and in the console, plays music in a loop, and then terminates after 10 seconds. No input/output manipulation, no network activity, no hidden or malicious code segments. The code uses standard library functions and straightforward logic aligned with its purpose. The file paths are relative and do not suggest malicious resource fetching or injection. There are no signs of code obfuscation, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign farewell multimedia display script with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs intended functions safely, with no malicious or suspicious activities detected.",
