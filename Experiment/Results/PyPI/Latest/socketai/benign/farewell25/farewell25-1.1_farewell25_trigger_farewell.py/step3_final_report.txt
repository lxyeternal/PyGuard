{
  "purpose": "Display a multimedia farewell message with background image and music, and print farewell text in console.",
  "sources": "Local media files 'farewell.png' and 'farewell.mp3'; console input is not used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; media files are loaded locally and played/displayed; console output is static.",
  "flows": "Media files are loaded from local paths; background image is scaled and displayed; music is loaded and played; console messages are printed sequentially.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() to clear console, which is unconventional but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes pygame, loads local media files, displays a graphical message, plays music, and outputs console farewell messages. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration is present. The media files are external but loaded locally, and the code performs straightforward multimedia presentation. The use of os.system() for clearing console is benign but slightly unconventional. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are detected. The code terminates after 10 seconds, indicating intended benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign multimedia farewell presentation with no malicious intent or security risks. It relies on local media files and displays messages without any suspicious or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
