  "conclusion": "The setup script appears benign and standard. The primary security concern is the implementation of 'show_farewell' in 'trigger_farewell.py'. Without inspecting that code, the package can be considered low risk, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The security risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects cautious suspicion due to the potential for malicious code in the referenced function. Further review of 'trigger_farewell.py' is recommended to confirm safety."
