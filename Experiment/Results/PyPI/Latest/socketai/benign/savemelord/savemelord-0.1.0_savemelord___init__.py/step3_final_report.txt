{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols from a local module named 'reader'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are directly involved.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the import brings symbols into namespace but does not execute or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure imported symbols, but no malicious or suspicious code is evident in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no execution, data flow, or network activity. The primary concern with 'import *' is namespace pollution and potential hiding of malicious code if the 'reader' module is compromised. Since the module's content is unknown, the risk is limited to trust issues rather than code behavior. Malware and obfuscation are not present; scores reflect the minimal risk. The overall security posture is very low risk, with scores appropriately set at zero for malware and obfuscation, and a low risk score due to the import pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and does not contain malicious behavior. The main security consideration is trusting the 'reader' module's content, which cannot be assessed here. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no changes are necessary.",
