  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious code inside the 'reader' module.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement: 'from .reader import *'. This imports all symbols from a local module named 'reader'. This pattern can be suspicious if the 'reader' module contains malicious code, but in isolation, the import statement itself is not inherently malicious. Since the actual content of 'reader' is not provided, the risk depends on that module's implementation. The import statement does not execute any code directly or perform any malicious actions itself. Its main concern is the potential for hiding malicious behavior within the imported module. There are no other suspicious elements such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a simple import statement, which by itself is not malicious. The primary concern is the content of the 'reader' module. Without further information, it is impossible to determine if the imported module contains malicious code. The snippet adheres to standard Python syntax, though using 'import *' can be risky for maintainability and hiding malicious code. Overall, the snippet itself does not show evidence of malicious behavior.",
