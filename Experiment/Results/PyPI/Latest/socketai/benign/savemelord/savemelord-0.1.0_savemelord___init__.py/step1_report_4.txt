  "purpose": "Re-exports all symbols from the 'reader' module, likely for simplified access or API exposure.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing everything from the relative 'reader' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, storage, or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can hide dependencies or malicious code, but alone does not indicate malicious intent. No other anomalies present.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of a single import statement that re-exports contents from another module. Without additional code, there are no apparent sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors. The use of 'import *' can obscure dependencies but is not inherently malicious. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, performing a simple import. No malicious activity or security issues are evident from this snippet.",
