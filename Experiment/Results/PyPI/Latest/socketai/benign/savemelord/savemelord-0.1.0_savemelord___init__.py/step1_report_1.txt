  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the local module 'reader'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module file 'reader'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink for untrusted data or external effects present.",
  "flows": "N/A, only an import statement; no data flow or execution flow observable.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure what is imported, but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement that imports all symbols from a local module named 'reader'. This pattern can sometimes hide malicious or unintended imports, but on its own, it is a common pattern in Python for convenience. There are no external data sources, no evaluation, no obfuscated code, and no signs of malicious behavior. The absence of additional code prevents any further analysis. Since this is a minimal snippet, confidence is limited but based on this alone, no malicious or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data handling or external communication, and there are no suspicious behaviors present.",
