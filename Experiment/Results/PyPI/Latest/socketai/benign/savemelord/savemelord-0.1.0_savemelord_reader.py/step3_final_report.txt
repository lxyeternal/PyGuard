  "purpose": "The code loads static text files embedded within the package using pkgutil.get_data() and prints their contents.",
  "sources": "pkgutil.get_data() calls retrieving specific resource files within the package",
  "sinks": "print() function outputs the decoded data to standard output",
  "flows": "pkgutil.get_data() retrieves data from package resources -> data.decode('utf-8') decodes the data -> print() outputs the data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward resource loading and printing, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple functions each loading a specific resource file via pkgutil.get_data(), decoding it, and printing its contents. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The functions are simple, standard, and serve likely educational or informational purposes. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The resource files are static and internal, and the code does not process untrusted input or perform any risky operations. The overall behavior is benign, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward resource loading and printing, with no malicious intent or security issues. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
