{
  "purpose": "The code loads and prints the contents of several text files from the package's data resources, likely for processing or display within a larger application.",
  "sources": "pkgutil.get_data calls retrieving data from package resources using __package__ and specific filenames.",
  "sinks": "Data is decoded to UTF-8 and printed to standard output; no other sinks such as network or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded via get_data from package resources, decoded, then printed; no external data flow outside the package context.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. Usage of pkgutil.get_data is standard for accessing package data.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically loads text data files from within the package using pkgutil.get_data, then prints their decoded contents. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident. All functions perform similar, straightforward data access and display tasks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely accessing and printing package resource data without any malicious intent. It adheres to standard practices for data retrieval within Python packages.",
