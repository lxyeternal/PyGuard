{
  "purpose": "The code loads and prints content from several text files related to various algorithms or processes, likely for educational or informational purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from files using pkgutil.get_data, with filenames specified explicitly in each function.",
  "sinks": "The data is decoded and printed directly to standard output; no further processing or external transmission occurs.",
  "flows": "Data is retrieved via pkgutil.get_data from specified files and then decoded and printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present. The functions are straightforward file reads and prints without dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The script consists of multiple functions that each load a specific text file using pkgutil.get_data and print its contents after decoding. There are no external network calls, no use of untrusted input beyond static file references, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code appears to serve as a simple content loader for educational material. No malicious or suspicious activity is detectable based on the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and primarily designed to load and display static text files. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The overall security risk is negligible.",
