{
  "purpose": "The code loads and prints contents of various text files related to different algorithms or data sets, likely for demonstration or educational purposes.",
  "sources": "pkgutil.get_data calls that read specific files within the package context.",
  "sinks": "The decode and print statements which output the file contents to the console.",
  "flows": "Data is read from package resources via pkgutil.get_data, then decoded and printed to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses pkgutil.get_data to retrieve data from package resources, then decodes and prints it. The approach is straightforward and does not involve user input, network access, or execution of external code. The files appear to be static text resources related to various algorithms or datasets. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The absence of dynamic or obfuscated code, along with no external interactions, indicates low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign implementation for reading and displaying static text files within a package. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
