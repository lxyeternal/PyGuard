  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Code Behavior & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code simply loads data files from package resources and prints their contents.\n   - No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of hardcoded secrets or malicious logic.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports do not mention any errors or flaws. Given the code's simplicity, this seems accurate.\n   - The functions uniformly perform safe, standard operations.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable given the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions of malicious intent.\n   - No evidence suggests any malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Consistency & Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - No report overstates or understates the risk.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code only loads static text files and prints them, the potential for malware is negligible.\n   - The use of `pkgutil.get_data()` is standard and safe.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, the code appears entirely benign, serving as a simple resource loader for educational or demonstrative purposes.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. Given the straightforward nature of the code, I agree with the assigned scores. No adjustments are necessary.",
