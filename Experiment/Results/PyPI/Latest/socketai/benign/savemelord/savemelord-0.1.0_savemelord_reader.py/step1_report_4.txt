  "purpose": "The code loads and prints contents of various text files from the package data using pkgutil.get_data().",
  "sources": "Data is read from package resources via pkgutil.get_data() for specific filenames.",
  "sinks": "The decoded data is printed to stdout with print(), which could potentially reveal sensitive data if present in the files.",
  "flows": "Data is read from package resources using get_data() and then passed directly to decode() and print(), forming a straightforward source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Usage of pkgutil.get_data() is standard for loading package data. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consistently loads text files embedded within the package and prints their decoded contents. There are no indications of external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious logic. The purpose appears to be educational or data-loading related. No anomalies or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended to load and display text data from package resources. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks within this snippet.",
