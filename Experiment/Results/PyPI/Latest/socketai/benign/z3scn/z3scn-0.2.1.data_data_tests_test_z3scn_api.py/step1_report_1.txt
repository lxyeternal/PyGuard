{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and controls a SCN actuator device, performing movement commands and sequences for testing and calibration purposes.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters to 'z3setup'; device info retrieval via 'dev.get_device_info'; device commands such as 'dev.go_home', 'dev.go_center', 'dev.load_position', and 'dev.submit_check'.",
  "sinks": "Device control commands that send position or operational instructions to the hardware; device termination call.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'z3setup' which prepares command parameters; then commands are issued to the device to perform movements; status and info are fetched from the device; final termination call ends the session.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; the script performs typical device control operations with standard delays and sequence logic. No hardcoded secrets, external network access, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a setup function that validates parameters, ensuring the 'com' port is specified and parameters are within valid ranges, with fallback defaults. The control logic sequences device movements for testing, including go home, center, and position cycling, with appropriate delays. All device commands are standard control functions. No malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious data handling detected. The script appears to be a normal device testing routine, relying on an external device API 'dev'. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The import of a third-party module 'z3scn' is assumed to be a legitimate SDK for device control.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign device control and testing routine with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It executes standard hardware commands and control flows without suspicious data handling or network activity.",
