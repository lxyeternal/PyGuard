{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and controls an SCN actuator device, performing movement sequences, position checks, and device termination.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the z3setup function, especially 'com' port and optional device parameters; device info queries like 'version'.",
  "sinks": "Device control commands such as dev.go_home(), dev.go_center(), dev.go_position(), dev.load_position(), dev.submit_check(), dev.terminate(), and print statements for logs.",
  "flows": "Parameters received by z3setup() influence device initialization; device commands control actuator movements; data flow from control logic to device commands and feedback collection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. Use of dev module appears consistent with device control. No unusual code constructs or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up device parameters with validation, controls an actuator through a sequence of position movements, and includes sleep delays. The z3setup function validates parameters, preventing invalid values. The control flow is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or external data leaks. Device commands are standard for hardware control. No anomalies or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard control sequence for an SCN actuator device, with proper parameter validation and typical movement commands. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate hardware control script.",
