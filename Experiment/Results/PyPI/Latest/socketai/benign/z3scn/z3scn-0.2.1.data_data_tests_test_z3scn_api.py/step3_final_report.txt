  "purpose": "Device control and testing routine for an actuator, including initialization, homing, centering, movement sequences, and shutdown.",
  "sources": "Parameters in z3setup (com, stroke, etc.), device command functions (go_home, go_center, load_position, go_position, submit_check, terminate).",
  "sinks": "Device command functions executing hardware movements; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation in z3setup -> device commands during test cycles -> termination.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual data handling detected. Parameter validation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs parameter validation, prepares device parameters, and executes a sequence of movements for testing. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The device commands are standard, with delays and checks. No external network activity or secrets are involved. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1-0.2). The code's purpose is legitimate hardware control, and the logic is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured device control routine with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a safe and benign script.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
