  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious indicators.",
  "sources": "Input reading points such as environment variables, network connections, file reads, and user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, execution of eval/exec, file modifications, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., environment variables, network) through code execution or processing functions to sinks (e.g., network, files).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), suspicious network activity, hardcoded strings, or unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code shows signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, and suspicious network activity, indicating malicious intent with high confidence. No benign patterns or typical safe practices are observed. The presence of obfuscation and suspicious network connections strongly suggest malicious behavior. The code's structure and indicators justify high malware and security risk scores. The lack of benign patterns and the suspicious features lead to a high confidence level in the malicious assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple malicious indicators, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and suspicious network activity, leading to a high likelihood of malicious intent. The scores are consistent with these findings, and the overall security risk is significant. The code should be considered malicious and avoided.",
