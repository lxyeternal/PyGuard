{
  "purpose": "The provided code is a test suite for various data processing utility functions related to JSON and CSV data, data annotation, mapping to NGSI-LD format, and merging predicted data.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from JSON files, CSV strings, and DataFrame creations; reading from files via data_to_dataframe and pandas.read_csv.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and function calls that process and validate data; no untrusted data being sent to external systems or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input data sources (JSON/CSV) -> DataFrame conversions -> Data annotation/mapping/merging functions -> assertions for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data handling observed. All data is static and used solely for testing purposes; no dynamic or hidden code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite utilizing pytest, pandas, and custom utility modules for data transformation and validation. It tests functions such as JSON to DataFrame conversion, data annotation, NGSI-LD data mapping, data restoration, column extraction, metadata addition, and data merging. No external network calls, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is apparent. The functions operate on static test data, with assertions ensuring correctness. The code structure and data handling are typical of testing modules without signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a conventional test suite for data processing utilities, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs static data validation without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
