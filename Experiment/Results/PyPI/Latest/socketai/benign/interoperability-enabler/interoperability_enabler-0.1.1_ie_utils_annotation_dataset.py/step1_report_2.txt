  "purpose": "The function adds quality annotation columns to a pandas DataFrame for NGSI-LD data, either at the instance level or attribute level.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame 'data', function arguments 'entity_type', 'assessed_attrs', 'type', 'context_value'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies the DataFrame by adding new columns with constructed string identifiers, but no external network or file I/O occurs.",
  "flows": "DataFrame is copied; new columns are created based on existing columns and function parameters; new columns are concatenated to the original DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "None evident. The code dynamically generates identifiers and adds columns but does not include any suspicious code such as network access, file operations, or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to add annotations to a pandas DataFrame. It carefully checks for the presence of certain columns ('type', 'id', '@context') and adds them if missing. It constructs URN-like strings for quality assessment objects, either for the whole data point or specific attributes. The string construction is straightforward, using data from existing columns and function parameters, with no apparent malicious logic. No network, file, or environment variable access is observed. The lambda functions used are simple string formatting; no user input is evaluated or executed. Overall, the code appears to perform a legitimate data annotation task without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard DataFrame manipulation utility that adds quality annotation metadata based on provided parameters. It does not contain malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The dynamic string creation is benign and aligned with typical data annotation workflows.",
