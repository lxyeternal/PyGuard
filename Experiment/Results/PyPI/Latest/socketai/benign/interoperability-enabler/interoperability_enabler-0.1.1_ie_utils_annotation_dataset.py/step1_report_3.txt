{
  "purpose": "The code adds quality annotations to a pandas DataFrame, either at the instance level or attribute level, for NGSI-LD data.",
  "sources": "The code reads the DataFrame 'data', and accesses columns such as 'type', 'id', '@context', and columns starting with attribute names specified in 'assessed_attrs'. It also reads input parameters 'entity_type', 'type', and 'context_value'.",
  "sinks": "The code generates new columns with URN strings related to data quality assessments, appending them to the DataFrame. There are no external data sinks, network communication, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame 'data' is copied; new columns are added based on conditions, with URN strings generated via string formatting, then concatenated back into the DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs string manipulations that appear benign. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious obfuscation. It raises an error if assessed attribute columns are missing. No apparent backdoors or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly manipulates a pandas DataFrame, adding columns for quality annotations. It creates identifiers with URN schemes based on existing DataFrame values and parameters. The string operations are straightforward and consistent with the purpose. No code injections, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform network communication, file system modifications, or system commands. It checks for existence of specific columns and raises errors for missing expected columns, which is standard. The use of lambda functions for generating identifiers is typical. Overall, the code seems to perform its annotation task without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard DataFrame manipulation script to add data quality annotation columns. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility for data annotation, with no suspicious activities detected.",
