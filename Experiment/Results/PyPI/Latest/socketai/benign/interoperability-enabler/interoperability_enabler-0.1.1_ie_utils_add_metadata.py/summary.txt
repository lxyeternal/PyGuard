  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for renaming DataFrame columns with validation. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The minimal risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports is slightly conservative; a score of 0 is more appropriate given the benign nature. The malware score remains 0, and obfuscation score remains 0."
