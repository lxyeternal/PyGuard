{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to add metadata (column names) back to a predicted DataFrame in a data processing pipeline.",
  "sources": "The function reads input DataFrame `predicted_df` and list `column_names` as input parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, external network communications, or untrusted data handling are present. No sinks for malicious effects are identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to modify the DataFrame's column names; the flow is straightforward and does not involve untrusted data processing beyond parameter assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs are observed. The exception handling simply prints errors and returns an empty DataFrame, which is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies that the number of columns in the DataFrame matches the length of the provided column_names list before assigning these names to the DataFrame. Exception handling manages mismatch errors gracefully. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, external network activity, or data exfiltration. The logic is straightforward and intended for DataFrame metadata management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves a data annotation purpose, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The minimal exception handling is appropriate for its purpose.",
