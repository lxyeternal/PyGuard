{
  "purpose": "The function adds metadata (column names) to a predicted DataFrame.",
  "sources": "The function reads the predicted DataFrame (predicted_df) and a list of column names (column_names).",
  "sinks": "The function assigns new column names to the DataFrame, which could potentially lead to data misinterpretation if misused, but no malicious sink is present.",
  "flows": "The input DataFrame and column names are used to set the DataFrame's columns, with validation to match dimensions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious data manipulation, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function to rename DataFrame columns after validation. It includes a try-except block to handle mismatched column counts, printing an error and returning an empty DataFrame if validation fails. The code does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or contain suspicious logic. It operates solely on input DataFrame and list of column names, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility function for data processing, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply renames DataFrame columns after validation, with proper error handling.",
