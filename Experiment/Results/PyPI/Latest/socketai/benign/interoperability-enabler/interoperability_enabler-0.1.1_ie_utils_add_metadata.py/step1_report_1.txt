{
  "purpose": "The code adds metadata (column names) to a predicted DataFrame, primarily for organizing or labeling prediction results.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'predicted_df' DataFrame and the 'column_names' list as inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks are unlikely; however, improper handling of the DataFrame could lead to incorrect data attribution or masking of issues, but no direct data leaks or malicious sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters 'predicted_df' and 'column_names' into the function, with column assignment as the main operation, and exception handling may result in returning an empty DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward operations; no suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The only notable aspect is the exception handling that suppresses errors by printing and returning an empty DataFrame.",
  "analysis": "The function verifies if the number of columns in 'predicted_df' matches the length of 'column_names'. If not, it raises and catches a ValueError, prints the error message, and returns an empty DataFrame. Otherwise, it assigns the provided column names to the DataFrame. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling. The code is simple, transparent, and does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign operation of renaming DataFrame columns with proper validation. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The only concern might be silent failure (returning empty DataFrame) upon mismatch, but this is a design choice rather than malicious behavior.",
