{
  "purpose": "To add metadata (column names) back to a predicted DataFrame.",
  "sources": "The function reads the predicted DataFrame and a list of column names as input parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns new column names to the DataFrame; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input: predicted_df and column_names -> Assign column_names to predicted_df.columns -> Return modified DataFrame or empty DataFrame on error.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected. The only exception handling is for a column mismatch error, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it takes a DataFrame and a list of column names, checks for a mismatch in number of columns, and assigns new column names if valid. It includes basic validation and error handling, with no use of external resources, network calls, or obfuscated code. The comments and structure are standard and clear. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility function for DataFrame metadata management. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a simple, well-structured piece of code for its intended purpose.",
