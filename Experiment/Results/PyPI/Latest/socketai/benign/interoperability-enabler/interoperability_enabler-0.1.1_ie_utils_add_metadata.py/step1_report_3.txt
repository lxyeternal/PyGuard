{
  "purpose": "The code assigns metadata (column names) to a predicted DataFrame to restore its original structure after predictions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input DataFrame 'predicted_df' and a list of column names 'column_names'.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns new column names to 'predicted_df' which could potentially be exploited if the input is malicious, but this is a standard operation.",
  "flows": "Input: 'predicted_df' and 'column_names' -> Validation check -> Assignment of 'column_names' to 'predicted_df.columns' -> Return of the modified DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The only noteworthy aspect is the input validation, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it takes a DataFrame and a list of column names, checks for consistency, and assigns the names to the DataFrame columns. It includes error handling for mismatched column counts, which prints an error message and returns an empty DataFrame if an issue occurs. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. Usage of standard pandas functions and simple error handling indicates benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function to assign column names to a DataFrame with basic validation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to restore metadata to a prediction DataFrame, with no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
