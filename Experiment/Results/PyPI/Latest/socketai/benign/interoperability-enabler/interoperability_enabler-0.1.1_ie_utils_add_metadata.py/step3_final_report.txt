  "flows": "predicted_df.shape[1] -> validation check -> predicted_df.columns = column_names",
  "anomalies": "Returns an empty DataFrame upon mismatch without raising an exception; prints error message",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple validation of DataFrame column count before assigning new column names. It includes exception handling that prints an error and returns an empty DataFrame if there's a mismatch. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The function is benign, intended for data annotation. The silent failure mode (returning an empty DataFrame) could be a concern operationally but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. No hardcoded secrets, external dependencies, or suspicious constructs are found. The code's behavior is straightforward and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for renaming DataFrame columns with validation. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The minimal risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports is slightly conservative; a score of 0 is more appropriate given the benign nature. The malware score remains 0, and obfuscation score remains 0.",
