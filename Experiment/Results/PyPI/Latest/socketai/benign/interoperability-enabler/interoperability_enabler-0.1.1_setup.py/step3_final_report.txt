  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description, importing setuptools for setup functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; dependencies are standard packages, no external data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; setup parameters are static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script with no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The 'long_description' reads from a local file, and dependencies are standard. The license field is empty, which is a minor best practice note but not a security concern. The reports are empty, indicating no detected issues. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be minimal or zero, consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is safe, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The empty reports support a benign assessment. The scores should be set to zero for malware and obfuscation, and very low for risk.",
