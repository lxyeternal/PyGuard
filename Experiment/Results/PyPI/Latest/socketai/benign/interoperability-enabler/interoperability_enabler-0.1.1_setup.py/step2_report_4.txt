  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully:\n\n1. **Report Content**: All five reports contain only \"Empty response\" errors with no detailed information or analysis. This means there are no specific claims, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behaviors documented to evaluate.\n\n2. **Code Review**:\n   - The provided code is a standard `setup.py` configuration for a Python package.\n   - It appears straightforward, with no obvious malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n   - The package name, author info, and dependencies are typical.\n   - The license field is empty, which isn't a security issue but could be a best practice concern.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes**:\n   - No explicit errors or malicious code are present.\n   - The absence of a license string might be a licensing oversight but not a security concern.\n   - The `long_description` reads from \"README.md\" — ensure that this file exists and is safe, but no evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0.0. No evidence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0. The code is clear and readable.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0.0. Since no issues are reported or evident, the overall risk is negligible.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - Since no claims or details are provided, there's no basis to assume vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores should reflect the absence of issues; thus, all should be near zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware Score**: **0.0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0.0** (code is clear)\n- **Risk Score**: **0.0** (no identified vulnerabilities or risks)\n\n### Summary:\nGiven the lack of any detailed reports or evidence, the package appears safe and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The empty reports do not provide any grounds for concern.\n\n**Recommendation**: No changes needed; maintain the current low scores. However, consider adding a license to the package for completeness and compliance.",
