  "purpose": "Convert pandas DataFrame data into NGSI-LD format and restore NGSI-LD structures, primarily for data integration within the SEDIMARK framework.",
  "sources": "DataFrame input (df) that reads data from CSV, XLS/XLSX, or JSON files; column values within the DataFrame.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no functions in the code write data to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Data from DataFrame columns (including timestamp conversions) flow into structured NGSI-LD entities, with some processing for nested attributes and context handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Handling of timestamps and nested attributes appears standard; no obfuscated code present. The 'type' field correction from 'null' is a standard data fix, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code processes input data to generate NGSI-LD formatted entities. It handles missing IDs and types by generating default identifiers, preserves existing '@context' if present, and converts timestamp fields into ISO8601 format. It manages nested attributes by splitting column names on '.', building nested dictionaries. The restore_ngsi_ld_structure function recursively restructures data, managing list-like keys with brackets. No external system calls, network communication, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code adheres to typical data processing practices without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data transformation utility for NGSI-LD data formatting and restoration, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles data safely and does not contain any hidden or malicious payloads.",
