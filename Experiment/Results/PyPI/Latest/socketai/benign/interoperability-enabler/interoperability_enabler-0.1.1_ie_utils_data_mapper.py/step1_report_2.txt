  "purpose": "Convert internal pandas DataFrame data to NGSI-LD format for use within SEDIMARK, and restore NGSI-LD structured data.",
  "sources": "DataFrame input 'df', reading columns and row data including timestamp fields, '@context', 'id', 'type', and other columns.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data to external systems; primarily data transformation within the function.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> process each row -> construct NGSI-LD entity -> handle nested attributes and timestamps -> output NGSI-LD entities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls observed. The code handles timestamp conversion and nested data processing normally. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data transformation: reading from pandas DataFrame, converting timestamp columns, handling nested attributes via splitting column names by '.', and constructing NGSI-LD JSON-like dicts. It includes context management and replacement of null 'type' values. No external network access, file I/O, or suspicious operations are present. The restore_ngsi_ld_structure function recursively processes NGSI-LD data, correctly handling nested lists and dicts, with no malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate data formatting for NGSI-LD compliance with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It strictly operates on data transformation without external or harmful actions. It appears to be a standard, benign data processing module.",
