  "purpose": "Convert pandas DataFrame data into NGSI-LD format and restore NGSI-LD structured data.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame rows, column values, and optional external context_value parameter.",
  "sinks": "Generated NGSI-LD entities, especially the 'id', nested attributes, and context.",
  "flows": "DataFrame row data → processing in data_conversion() → NGSI-LD entity objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or backdoors observed. The code handles timestamps and nested attributes, but no unusual code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script processes DataFrame rows, converting them into NGSI-LD format with handling for missing 'id' and 'type' fields, and optional '@context'. Timestamps are converted from numeric to ISO format, which is standard. It manages nested attributes via dot notation, creating nested dictionaries, and appends '@context' if provided. The restore_ngsi_ld_structure function recursively processes nested structures, flattening list indices into list elements. No network, file I/O, or external system interactions are present. No suspicious or malicious logic such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors is evident. The code appears to be a legitimate data processing utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data transformation utility for NGSI-LD formatting with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles data cleanly and predictably without insecure patterns.",
