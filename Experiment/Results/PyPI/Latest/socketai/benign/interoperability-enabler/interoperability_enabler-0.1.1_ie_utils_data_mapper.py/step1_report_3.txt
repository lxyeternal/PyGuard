  "purpose": "Convert pandas DataFrame to NGSI-LD format and restore NGSI-LD structure.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame 'df' and its columns; row data accessed via iterrows; external inputs via function parameters such as 'entity_type' and 'context_value'.",
  "sinks": "Constructed 'entity' dictionary with potential for embedding malicious data if input DataFrame contains malicious payloads; no external system calls or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Data read from DataFrame columns (sources) flows into structured 'entity' objects, with timestamp conversion and nested attribute handling; no external sinks for untrusted data are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or backdoors; the code is straightforward data transformation with timestamp formatting and nested attribute handling. No obfuscated or misleading code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data transformation from pandas DataFrame to NGSI-LD JSON format, including timestamp conversion, handling of '@context', nested attributes, and entity identification. It relies solely on standard library modules and pandas DataFrame iteration. No external system calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution is observed. The functions are designed for data formatting, with no indication of malicious intent. The handling of input data is safe, assuming the DataFrame contents are from trusted sources. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data mapping utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It properly processes and structures data for NGSI-LD format without involving any potentially dangerous operations. The likelihood of malicious intent is negligible.",
