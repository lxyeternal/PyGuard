  "purpose": "Convert pandas DataFrame data into NGSI-LD format for SEDIMARK, and restore NGSI-LD structured data.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame 'df', which reads data from CSV, XLS, XLSX, or JSON; and row data within iteration.",
  "sinks": "None identified that directly lead to data leaks or harmful actions. No external network, file system, or system command operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data is read from the DataFrame; timestamps are converted; data is structured into NGSI-LD format; no external or untrusted data is sent or executed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; code follows standard data transformation practices.",
  "analysis": "The code processes input data to produce NGSI-LD formatted entities, handling 'id', 'type', '@context', and nested attributes. Timestamps are converted to ISO format where applicable. The function 'restore_ngsi_ld_structure' recursively reconstructs data structures, properly handling nested lists and dictionaries. No network operations, external commands, or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears to serve a data transformation purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data conversion and restructuring with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for data formatting purposes only.",
