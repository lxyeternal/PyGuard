  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network connections, file operations, dynamic execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, environment variable access, dynamic code execution, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data or environment variables to dynamic execution or network transmission points, potentially hiding malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, dynamic code execution, complex or confusing logic, hardcoded strings or credentials, unusual imports or function calls.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution signs, indicating potential malicious intent. No explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, but obfuscation and complex logic suggest concealment. Benign reports lack suspicious features. The scores are generally consistent with the descriptions, with Report 3 showing notable suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic features. The malware score for Report 3 is adjusted to 0.4 to better reflect the potential risk, while others remain at 0. The security risk score for Report 3 is justified at 0.6, indicating moderate to high concern. Confidence levels are high where analysis is conclusive, moderate where limited information exists.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, but Report 3's obfuscation and dynamic features warrant cautious review. The current scores are appropriate, with a slight increase in malware suspicion for Report 3. Overall, the dependency shows low to moderate risk, with obfuscation as the primary concern.",
