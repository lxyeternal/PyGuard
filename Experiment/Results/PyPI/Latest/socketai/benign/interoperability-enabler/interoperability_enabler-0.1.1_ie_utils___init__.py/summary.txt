  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, but Report 3's obfuscation and dynamic features warrant cautious review. The current scores are appropriate, with a slight increase in malware suspicion for Report 3. Overall, the dependency shows low to moderate risk, with obfuscation as the primary concern."
