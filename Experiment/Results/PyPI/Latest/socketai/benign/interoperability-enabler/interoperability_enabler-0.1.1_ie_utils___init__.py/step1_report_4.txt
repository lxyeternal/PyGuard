  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing and possibly interacts with external systems, but its specific purpose is not explicitly clear from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user inputs, environment variables, or external data sources such as files or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to outputs like logs, network endpoints, or stored in files/databases. Potentially untrusted data may be written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to outputs or network calls, but no explicit flow path is confirmed due to missing code details.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are visible. However, absence of context limits confidence.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step, the code appears to use standard Python features. No suspicious functions like eval, exec, or dynamic code execution are detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior is evident. The code's purpose seems benign, focused on data handling. Without specific network or system call details, no malicious activity can be identified. The overall structure does not suggest obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to perform routine data processing with no suspicious elements identified. However, due to limited context, confidence is moderate.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
