  "purpose": "Merge two pandas DataFrames by aligning columns, filling missing columns with 'null', and concatenating.",
  "sources": "Reading input DataFrames: df_initial and predicted_df_with_metadata",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows leading to security vulnerabilities; potential data leaks if inputs are malicious, but not malicious code.",
  "flows": "Source DataFrames are processed to identify all columns, missing columns are filled with 'null', columns are reordered, then DataFrames are concatenated.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sorted(all_columns) may alter original column order; exception handling only prints errors, which could leak info but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard pandas DataFrame operations: union of columns, filling missing with 'null', reordering, and concatenation. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. Exception handling is minimal. No external network calls, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected. The logic is sound, with minor design considerations about column order preservation. The security risk is minimal, primarily operational if untrusted data is processed, but no active threats are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data merging utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is very low, and the malware score is correctly set to 0. The overall assessment indicates no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
