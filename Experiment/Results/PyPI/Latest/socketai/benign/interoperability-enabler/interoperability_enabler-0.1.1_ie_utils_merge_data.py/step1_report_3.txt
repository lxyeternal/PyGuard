{
  "purpose": "The code merges two pandas DataFrames, aligning columns and filling missing columns with 'null', then concatenates them.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrames: df_initial and predicted_df_with_metadata.",
  "sinks": "The concatenation operation potentially exposes data if untrusted DataFrames are passed, but in this context, it is a benign data operation.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrames are processed, missing columns are added with 'null' values, columns are sorted, and then the DataFrames are concatenated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears straightforward and intended for data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to merge two DataFrames by union of columns, adding missing columns filled with 'null', then reordering columns and concatenating. The process is standard for data merging. No dynamic code execution, network access, or other suspicious behavior is evident. Error handling is simple, printing exceptions without further malicious activity. No signs of backdoors or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard, benign DataFrame merging operation. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
