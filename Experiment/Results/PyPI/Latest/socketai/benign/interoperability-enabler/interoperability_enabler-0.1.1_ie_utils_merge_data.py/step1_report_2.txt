{
  "purpose": "The function merges two pandas DataFrames, aligning columns and filling missing columns with 'null'.",
  "sources": "Inputs: df_initial and predicted_df_with_metadata DataFrames, which are read when passed into the function.",
  "sinks": "The DataFrames are processed entirely within memory; no external sinks or untrusted outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input DataFrames through column union and reordering, then concatenation into a merged DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "The code straightforwardly performs DataFrame merging; no suspicious or unusual code constructs are present. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically adjusts missing columns by assigning 'null' values, which is standard pandas manipulation. The only potential concern is if untrusted DataFrames are passed, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No external calls, network activities, or obfuscated code. The error handling prints errors but does not leak sensitive info or execute unsafe actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data merging utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions to align and combine DataFrames, with proper handling of missing columns. No malicious intent or malware detected.",
