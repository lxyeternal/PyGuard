{
  "purpose": "The code merges two Pandas DataFrames by aligning columns and filling missing columns with 'null'.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input DataFrames 'df_initial' and 'predicted_df_with_metadata' and accesses their 'columns' attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code performs DataFrame concatenation, which could lead to data leaks if the DataFrames contain sensitive data, but no direct sink like network or file I/O is present.",
  "flows": "Columns from both DataFrames are combined; missing columns are filled with 'null'. The DataFrames are then concatenated, creating a merged DataFrame containing all data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The function handles exceptions generally but does not perform unsafe operations. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard DataFrame merging operations: union of columns, filling missing columns with 'null', and concatenating DataFrames. It uses try-except for error handling but does not perform any unsafe or malicious actions. No external data exfiltration, system calls, or hidden behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and typical for data processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data merging function without malicious intent. It handles missing data gracefully and provides a safe way to combine DataFrames. No security risks or malware behaviors are detected.",
