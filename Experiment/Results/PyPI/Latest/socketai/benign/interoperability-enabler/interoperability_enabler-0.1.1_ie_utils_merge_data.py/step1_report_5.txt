{
  "purpose": "The code merges two DataFrames by aligning columns and filling missing columns with 'null'.",
  "sources": "DataFrames df_initial and predicted_df_with_metadata are read as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "pd.concat is used to combine the DataFrames, potentially exposing untrusted data if the inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrames are processed to add missing columns with 'null', then reordered and concatenated to produce a merged DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically adds columns with 'null' values; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures. Exception handling is present but generic.",
  "analysis": "The function starts by collecting all unique columns from both input DataFrames, then ensures each column exists in both DataFrames by adding missing columns with the value 'null'. It reorders the DataFrames to have matching column orders before concatenating them. The concatenation merges the original and predicted data vertically. The only potential concern is the handling of untrusted DataFrames, which could be maliciously crafted to cause memory issues or data leaks, but no malicious behaviors like network access or code execution are present. The code relies on standard pandas operations and does not execute any code or commands. The exception handling captures errors but does not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard merge operation with some input validation and handling missing columns by filling with 'null'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. It operates as a typical data processing utility with minimal risk.",
