  "purpose": "Merge predicted data into an initial DataFrame, aligning columns and filling missing ones with 'null'.",
  "sources": "DataFrame inputs: df_initial and predicted_df_with_metadata.",
  "sinks": "pd.concat() function merges DataFrames; potential for large memory usage if DataFrames are huge.",
  "flows": "DataFrames are modified by adding missing columns with 'null', then merged via pd.concat.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward DataFrame merging operation, ensuring all columns are present in both DataFrames by adding missing columns with 'null' values. It then reorders columns to match the initial DataFrame and concatenates them. Exception handling is present to catch errors during merging, printing errors and returning an empty DataFrame. The logic is standard and uses pandas functions properly, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data merging function with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks, just typical data handling operations.",
