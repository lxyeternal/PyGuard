{
  "purpose": "The code converts data from various formats (CSV, XLS, XLSX, JSON, JSON-LD) into a pandas DataFrame, primarily handling JSON-LD data related to NGSI-LD format.",
  "sources": "File path input (file_path argument) which determines the data source. File reading functions such as open() for JSON/JSON-LD files.",
  "sinks": "The code processes data and stores it into a pandas DataFrame. It does not write data to external systems or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input file path → File reading (based on extension) → JSON parsing and flattening → DataFrame creation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscated code. The code's JSON parsing and data processing appear standard. Error handling is limited to printing errors, which is typical for such scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs data ingestion from various formats with standard libraries. It uses pandas for data processing and json for JSON parsing. The flattening functions handle nested data, including lists and dictionaries, with options to preserve specific keys. There are no network communications, system modifications, or dynamic code execution observed. Error handling is basic but safe, only printing exceptions without executing or leaking data. The code appears solely designed for data transformation without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data processing utility with no indications of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It strictly performs data loading, flattening, and conversion tasks with standard libraries and methods.",
