{
  "purpose": "The code reads various data formats (CSV, XLS, XLSX, JSON, JSON-LD) and converts them into a pandas DataFrame for internal use, with specific handling for nested JSON structures.",
  "sources": "File input via file_path parameter, reading files with specific extensions, JSON loading from files.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the data is processed internally and returned as a DataFrame without external communication or side effects.",
  "flows": "File path input -> file reading (depending on extension) -> JSON parsing (if applicable) -> data flattening -> DataFrame creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code handles data transformation and does not perform any network operations or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script processes data files and converts them into DataFrames. It includes functions for flattening nested JSON-like structures, with provisions to preserve certain keys (like 'coordinates' and '@context'). The exception handling prints errors but does not escalate or hide malicious intent. No code injections, data exfiltration, or system manipulation routines are present. The code relies on standard libraries (json, pandas) and common data processing logic. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or external communication routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data processing utility designed to load and normalize various data formats into pandas DataFrames. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this module.",
