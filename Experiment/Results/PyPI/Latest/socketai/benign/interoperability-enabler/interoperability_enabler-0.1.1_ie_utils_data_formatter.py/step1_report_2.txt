{
  "purpose": "The code reads various data formats (CSV, XLS, XLSX, JSON, JSON-LD) and converts them into pandas DataFrames, primarily for data transformation and analysis.",
  "sources": "File input via 'file_path' argument; reading from files with extensions .xls, .xlsx, .csv, .json, .jsonld",
  "sinks": "Data is loaded into pandas DataFrame; no external network or file modifications are performed beyond reading files",
  "flows": "File path input → File read based on extension → Data parsing (Excel, CSV, JSON-LD) → Data flattening → DataFrame creation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic; no code injection, network activity, or system modifications observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data loading and JSON flattening using standard libraries and functions. It handles multiple file formats with appropriate parsing, and includes recursion for flattening nested dictionaries and lists. There are no indicators of malicious intent such as network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Exception handling is limited to printing error messages, which is typical for data processing scripts. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate data transformation utility without malicious or sabotage behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data processing script designed for format conversions and JSON flattening. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
