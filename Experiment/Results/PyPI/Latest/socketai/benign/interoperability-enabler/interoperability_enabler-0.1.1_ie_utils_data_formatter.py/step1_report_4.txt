{
  "purpose": "The code reads various data formats (CSV, XLS, JSON, JSON-LD) and converts them into a pandas DataFrame, with special handling for nested JSON/JSON-LD structures.",
  "sources": "File input via the 'file_path' argument, reading from disk, and JSON data loaded from files.",
  "sinks": "DataFrame creation and potential data processing steps; no direct data leakage or sensitive data exfiltration points detected.",
  "flows": "File input -> Data loading (pandas.read_excel/read_csv/json.load) -> Data flattening and DataFrame construction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Use of standard libraries without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard file I/O operations, including reading Excel, CSV, JSON, and JSON-LD files, then processes JSON data by flattening nested structures for DataFrame conversion. The functions utilize recursive flattening with preserved keys for specific fields. No code injection, remote network calls, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. Error handling is limited to printing exceptions without further action, which is typical for debugging but not malicious. The code relies solely on standard Python libraries (json, pandas) and contains no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or insecure data handling mechanisms are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data processing utility designed to convert various data formats into pandas DataFrames, with proper handling for nested JSON structures. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks present in this module.",
