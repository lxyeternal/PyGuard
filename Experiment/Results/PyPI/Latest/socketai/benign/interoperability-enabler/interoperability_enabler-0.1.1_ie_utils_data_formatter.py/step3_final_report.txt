{
  "purpose": "The code reads various data formats (CSV, XLS, XLSX, JSON, JSON-LD) and converts them into a pandas DataFrame, with special handling for nested JSON structures via flattening functions.",
  "sources": "File input paths, reading from disk using open() for JSON/JSON-LD files, and pandas functions for Excel and CSV files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications; data is processed internally into DataFrames.",
  "flows": "File path input -> file reading (json.load or pandas.read_excel/read_csv) -> data parsing -> flattening nested JSON structures -> DataFrame creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation; exception handling only prints errors without escalation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data ingestion and flattening routines using common libraries. It handles nested JSON by recursive flattening, preserves certain keys, and supports multiple formats. No network activity, malicious code, or obfuscation is present. Error handling is minimal but typical for such scripts. The code's logic is straightforward, and no vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data processing utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It correctly handles multiple data formats, performs recursive flattening, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious routines. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
