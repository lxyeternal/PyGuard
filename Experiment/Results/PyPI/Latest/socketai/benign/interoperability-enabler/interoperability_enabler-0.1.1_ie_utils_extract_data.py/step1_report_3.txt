  "purpose": "The code extracts specified columns from a pandas DataFrame based on provided indices.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame 'df' and 'column_indices' argument, which is a list of integers.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a new DataFrame containing selected columns; no untrusted data output or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Input 'df' and 'column_indices' flow into the function, which processes and outputs a subset DataFrame and column names.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. Exception handling only prints errors, which is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to select columns from a DataFrame by index, validating indices, and returning the subset and column names. Exception handling is minimal and only prints errors without side effects or external calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior or data leakage, and no unusual code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign utility function for DataFrame manipulation with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
