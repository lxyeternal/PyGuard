{
  "purpose": "The code extracts specified columns from a pandas DataFrame based on provided column indices, returning the selected data and corresponding column names.",
  "sources": "The function reads the DataFrame 'df' passed as an argument; it also uses 'column_indices' provided as a parameter.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a DataFrame and prints error messages to the console; no untrusted data output or network activity is present.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame and column indices flow into the function; selected columns are returned, and errors are printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The error handling only prints messages; no external calls or risky operations are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs column selection within a DataFrame, with validation for indices. Error handling is limited to printing messages. There is no use of external resources, no data leaks, no code injection points, and no malicious activities. The logic is straightforward and typical for data processing tasks. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are detected. The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O beyond input DataFrame, or use of environment variables. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard DataFrame column selection utility with basic error handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe for use in a broader data processing pipeline.",
