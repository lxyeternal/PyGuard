  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Functionality and Security Presence:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward utility for selecting columns from a pandas DataFrame based on provided indices.\n   - The code performs validation on indices, maps them to column names, and returns the selected subset along with the column names.\n   - Error handling is limited to printing messages and returning empty DataFrames, with no external resource access, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n   - The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or backdoors.\n\n2. **Errors or Flaws in the Report:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a standard, safe utility.\n   - The only minor note is that some reports assign a \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1, which might suggest a very minimal concern, but given the code's nature, this is probably overly cautious.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Risk Score:** The scores are mostly 0 or 0.1, which seems reasonable given the benign nature of the code. The slight elevation to 0.1 in some reports may reflect a conservative approach but isn't justified by any actual vulnerability.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The code assumes the DataFrame is already loaded and supplied correctly, which is standard.\n   - The only potential concern could be if the DataFrame contains sensitive data, but the function itself does not handle secrets or external communication.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are based on evidence; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a simple, well-structured utility with no malicious behavior.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable; a malware score of 0 is justified.\n   - The security risk score could be lowered to 0, given the lack of any security concerns.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign utility for DataFrame column extraction, with no security risks or malware present. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate, with minor room for adjustment to reflect the lack of any concern.",
