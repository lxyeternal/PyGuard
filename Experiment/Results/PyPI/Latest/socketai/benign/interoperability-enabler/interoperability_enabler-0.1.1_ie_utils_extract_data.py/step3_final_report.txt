  "purpose": "Utility function to extract specified columns from a pandas DataFrame based on column indices, validating indices and returning the subset along with column names.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame 'df' provided as a parameter, reading column data; no external data sources or input streams.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or file output; only returns a DataFrame and list of column names.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> index validation -> mapping indices to column names -> selection of columns -> return selected DataFrame and column names.",
  "anomalies": "Exception handling includes catching FileNotFoundError, which is unnecessary since no file I/O occurs within this function; only prints error messages.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward column selection with index validation. It does not contain obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or external communication. Error handling is minimal but acceptable; the inclusion of FileNotFoundError handling is redundant. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Minor improvements could be made by removing irrelevant exception handling, but overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for DataFrame column extraction with proper validation. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior is present. The current scores are appropriate; the malware score should remain 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk very low (~0.1). The exception handling could be refined, but it does not impact security.",
