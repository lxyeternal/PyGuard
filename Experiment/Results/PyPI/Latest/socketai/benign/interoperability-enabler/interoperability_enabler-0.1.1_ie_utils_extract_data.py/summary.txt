  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for DataFrame column extraction with proper validation. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior is present. The current scores are appropriate; the malware score should remain 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk very low (~0.1). The exception handling could be refined, but it does not impact security."
