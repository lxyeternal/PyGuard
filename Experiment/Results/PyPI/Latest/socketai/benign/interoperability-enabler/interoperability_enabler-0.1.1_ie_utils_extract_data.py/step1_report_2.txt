{
  "purpose": "The code extracts specified columns from a pandas DataFrame based on column indices and returns the selected columns along with their names.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame 'df' provided as a parameter, which is expected to be read or loaded elsewhere in the application.",
  "sinks": "Returns a subset DataFrame 'selected_df' and column names, which could be used downstream. No direct data leaks or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input DataFrame 'df' through index validation and selection to output variables 'selected_df' and 'column_names'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated segments observed. Error handling is basic and does not perform unsafe operations. No external network calls or sensitive data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward DataFrame column selection based on provided indices. It validates indices to prevent index errors, maps indices to column names, and returns the selected subset. Error handling is limited to printing messages and returning empty DataFrames. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration. The logic is clear, and no unusual or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility function for DataFrame column extraction with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a benign, well-structured data processing function.",
