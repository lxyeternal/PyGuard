{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract specified columns from a pandas DataFrame, based on column indices, and return the selected subset along with the corresponding column names.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the 'df' parameter, which is a pandas DataFrame supplied by the caller.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the selected DataFrame and column names; it also prints error messages to standard output if exceptions occur.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame 'df' flows into the function, which processes column indices to produce a subset DataFrame and metadata. Errors may flow through exception handling to printing messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures are present. The exception handling is straightforward and related to standard file operations and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation on column indices and selects columns from a DataFrame. It includes try-except blocks for handling 'FileNotFoundError' and 'ValueError'. No dynamic code execution, external network communication, or obfuscation is present. The function assumes the DataFrame is already loaded, with no security-sensitive operations or secrets handled. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The print statements are for user feedback and do not pose security risks. The code structure is clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for column extraction from pandas DataFrames, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a straightforward implementation with proper validation and error handling.",
