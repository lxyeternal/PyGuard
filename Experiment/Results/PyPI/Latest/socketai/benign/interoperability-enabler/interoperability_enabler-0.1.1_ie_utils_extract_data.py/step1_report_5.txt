{
  "purpose": "The code extracts specific columns from a pandas DataFrame based on provided column indices and returns both the selected DataFrame and the corresponding column names.",
  "sources": "The code reads the DataFrame input 'df' and the list of column indices 'column_indices'.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks that handle untrusted data in a harmful way; the code primarily processes data within the local environment.",
  "flows": "The function maps column indices to column names and then selects these columns from the DataFrame, returning the subset and column names.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious network activity, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing tasks: validating column indices, mapping indices to column names, and selecting columns from a DataFrame. It includes basic error handling for invalid indices and file not found errors. There is no evidence of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The logic is straightforward, and no suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data extraction utility for pandas DataFrames with proper validation and error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It appears safe and intended solely for data processing.",
