      "conclusion": "The provided scores are generally appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Report 1's high malware and obfuscation scores are justified. Reports 2 and 3 correctly indicate no code or risk. Report 4's obfuscation score is adjusted downward to reflect minimal obfuscation, maintaining low risk. Report 5's moderate obfuscation score aligns with the evidence. Overall, the assessments accurately reflect the security posture of the code snippets."
