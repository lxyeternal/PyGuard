  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python package intended for general use, possibly providing some utility functions or features. The specific functionality is not clear from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are likely read from standard input, environment variables, or configuration files (not explicitly shown). There are no obvious direct sources of untrusted data in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file operations, or system commands if used later in the code. No explicit sinks are visible in the current fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (if any) to sinks through functions or operations within the code. Since the code snippet is minimal, no explicit source-to-sink flow can be established.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code detected in the provided snippet. The code structure appears standard. No unusual or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious Python module with typical structure. No signs of malware, suspicious data handling, or security issues are visible. There are no indicators of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The absence of external data or network activity in the snippet limits detection of malicious activity, but based on what is present, the code looks benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve a benign purpose with no anomalies or suspicious elements detected.",
