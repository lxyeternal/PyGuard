  "purpose": "Assessment of supply chain security for open source Python dependency based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network/file operations, code strings, dynamic execution points (eval/exec), hardcoded URLs, suspicious patterns, obfuscated code segments.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, data processing functions, dynamic code execution points, environment variable access, potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or code strings leading to dynamic execution or network communication points.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, eval/exec usage, suspicious URLs or strings, inconsistent code patterns, hardcoded secrets, unnecessary dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with no suspicious activity, assigning low malware and obfuscation scores (0). Report 3 highlights obfuscation and dynamic code execution, justifying high scores (malware 0.75, obfuscated 0.9). Confidence levels align with the evidence, and scores are consistent with the described behaviors. The overall security risk is low except for Report 3, which warrants higher concern. The assessments are coherent, with no contradictions or unjustified flags.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are generally accurate and consistent. Only Report 3 shows signs of obfuscation and malicious potential, justified by high scores. Other reports correctly identify benign code. Overall, supply chain risk remains low, with appropriate caution in suspicious cases.",
