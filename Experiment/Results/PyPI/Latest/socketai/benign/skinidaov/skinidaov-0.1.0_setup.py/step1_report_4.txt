  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'skinidaov'. It specifies package metadata and installation requirements.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from its own literals and function calls such as 'find_packages()' and the parameters within 'setup()'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted or external data is processed or used; the code does not handle user input or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Since all data is statically defined, there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code are present. The code strictly adheres to standard package setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup script using 'setuptools'. It contains no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, nor any network activity or suspicious behavior. It serves solely to configure package metadata. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears safe and normal for package distribution purposes.",
