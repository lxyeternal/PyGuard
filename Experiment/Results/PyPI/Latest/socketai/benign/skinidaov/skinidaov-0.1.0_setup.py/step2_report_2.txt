  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, static setup script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code execution, external input handling, or obfuscated/malicious code is detected.\n- The package metadata appears standard, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n- The email address is a personal contact, which is common and not suspicious.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code provided matches the description in each report.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or code flaws are identified.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the context.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- The reports' scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis.\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present, higher scores are unwarranted.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting high certainty based on the static and standard nature of the code.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- None detected. The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The code is a typical setup.py with no issues.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The security risk score should stay at 0.\n\n**Estimated scores based on my review:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat. The scores are justified and should not be adjusted.",
