  "purpose": "A static setup.py script defining package metadata for 'skinidaov'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; only static package information is provided.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process or output external data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only executes static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static setup.py script using setuptools to define package info. It contains no dynamic code, external input handling, or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified given the static and straightforward nature of the code. Confidence is high (1), as the analysis is based on static inspection. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
