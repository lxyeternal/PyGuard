  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, static setup script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code, external inputs, or obfuscated code are detected.\n- The package metadata appears standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The email address is a personal contact but does not indicate malicious activity.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code is a standard `setup.py` script with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None detected.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports. They all correctly identify the code as standard and benign.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified; the code does not perform any insecure actions or data handling.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports' confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the thorough review, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a typical, benign package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is standard, static, and contains no malicious logic or obfuscation. It poses no security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
