  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'skinidaov' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters including package discovery, author info, and license details.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is a static configuration for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and requirements. It does not contain any code that reads external input during execution nor does it perform any operations beyond static configuration. There are no suspicious functions, dynamic code execution, or embedded malicious logic. The email address is publicly known, and all fields appear standard for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks.",
