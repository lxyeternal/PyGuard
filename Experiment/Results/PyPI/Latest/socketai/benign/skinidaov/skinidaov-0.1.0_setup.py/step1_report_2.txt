{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'skinidaov' including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "User-provided static data such as package name, version, description, author info, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effects; setup configuration is static and does not execute code at runtime beyond package metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions; setup parameters are static strings and lists defined at code load time.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is standard setup.py format with no unusual constructs or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for packaging Python projects. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with static parameters. There are no dynamic executions, external data inputs, or suspicious behaviors. The author email and description seem legitimate. The code does not contain any logic that could be malicious or indicative of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
