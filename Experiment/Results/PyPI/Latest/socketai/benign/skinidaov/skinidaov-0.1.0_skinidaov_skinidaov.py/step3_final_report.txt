  "purpose": "Simple numeric transformations for ID formatting and normalization.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'id' converted to int, then to string; string slicing and length checks.",
  "sinks": "No external data or network interactions; no data leaks or malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Input 'id' -> numeric conversion -> string manipulation -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "Assumes specific string lengths (e.g., id[3]) without validation, which can cause runtime errors; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward arithmetic and string formatting. It relies on assumptions about input length, which could lead to errors if inputs are malformed, but there is no evidence of malicious intent. No external data access, network activity, or secrets are involved. The functions are benign ID formatting utilities with minor fragility due to assumptions, not obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The functions are simple, benign ID formatting utilities with minor robustness issues. No malicious activity or security risks are present. The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0.1 due to fragile assumptions, and security risk score is 0.1 reflecting potential runtime errors but no security threat.",
