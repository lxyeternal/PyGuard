{
  "purpose": "The functions appear to perform transformations on numeric identifiers, possibly for encoding or formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'id' in both functions, which are converted to strings and manipulated.",
  "sinks": "Return statements output the transformed 'id', which could be used downstream for display or storage.",
  "flows": "Input 'id' -> string conversion and arithmetic operations -> string slicing and conditional logic -> return output.",
  "anomalies": "Code relies on string slicing with assumptions about string length; the line 'if id[3] == \"0\"' could cause IndexError if 'id' is shorter than 4 characters. No use of external data, environment variables, or network operations. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code converts input 'id' to an integer, adjusts it by ±1, then performs string slicing based on length and specific character conditions. The conditional 'if id[3] == \"0\"' assumes 'id' has at least four characters, which might lead to runtime errors if not validated. The functions do not contain any apparent malicious behavior or malicious data handling. They are simple formatting functions. No obfuscation, no external data access, and no suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward numeric-to-string transformations without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. The main concern is potential runtime errors if input lengths are not validated, but this does not imply malicious behavior.",
