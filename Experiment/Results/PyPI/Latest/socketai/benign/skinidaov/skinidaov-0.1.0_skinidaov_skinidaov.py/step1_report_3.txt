{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform simple numerical transformations on an input identifier, converting it to a modified base or standard format.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'id' in both functions, which is converted from and to strings representing numerical values.",
  "sinks": "String manipulation operations; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'id' is converted to integer, manipulated, and then returned as a string, with modifications depending on character conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code performs straightforward numeric transformations.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform basic arithmetic on the input id, converting to string, adding or subtracting 1, and conditionally modifying the string format based on specific character checks. There is no use of environment variables, file operations, network communication, or code injection mechanisms. The logic is simple and appears to serve a formatting or ID normalization purpose without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple data transformations with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
