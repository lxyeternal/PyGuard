{
  "purpose": "The functions appear to manipulate numerical IDs, converting them to a base-like format and reverting them to a standard format.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'id' received as function argument, converted from string to int.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or external outputs; no file, network, or environment variable interactions.",
  "flows": "Input 'id' -> Conversion to int -> String manipulation -> Output string.",
  "anomalies": "The string slicing and conditional logic could potentially be used for obfuscation, but there are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors. The line 'id[3]' assumes 'id' has at least 4 characters, which could cause an IndexError if input is shorter, but this is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic numerical transformations, adding or subtracting 1, and rearranging string components based on specific conditions. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The potential for errors exists if input is malformed, but this does not indicate malicious behavior. The code’s purpose seems to be ID formatting or obfuscation, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be simple ID formatting functions with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. The logic is straightforward and does not involve external data or sensitive operations.",
