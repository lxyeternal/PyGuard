  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code structure, behavior, and indicators.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include code execution points such as eval(), exec(), network calls, environment variables, and input functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, command execution, network transmission, or file modifications where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like user input or network to sinks such as system commands, network endpoints, or file systems, possibly via dynamic execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network addresses, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code appears minimal or obfuscated in some reports, with no explicit malicious activity detected. Suspicion arises mainly from opacity and obfuscation scores, especially in Report 1. Dynamic execution functions or network activity are noted as potential concerns but lack concrete evidence. The low malware scores (0 to 0.2) are appropriate given the absence of definitive malicious behavior. Obfuscation scores are justified where indicated. Overall, the risk scores reflect cautious suspicion but remain low, aligning with the evidence. Confidence levels are moderate to high, based on code opacity and behavior descriptions. No significant anomalies are detected that would suggest high threat levels.",
  "conclusion": "The evaluated reports are consistent in their scoring and reasoning, with low malware risk and moderate suspicion where obfuscation or ambiguity exists. The scores are justified and appropriate, indicating no immediate threat but warranting continued monitoring if additional code or context becomes available.",
