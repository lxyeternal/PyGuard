      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated CLI scaffolding module. It poses minimal security risk, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.1) accurately reflects the static, structural nature of the code. The high confidence score (close to 1) is justified given the absence of any malicious or suspicious patterns."

The reports are empty and do not provide evidence to challenge this assessment. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code itself is not malicious but employs a pattern (dynamic import and execution) that can be exploited to run malicious code if untrusted modules are supplied. The malware score should be increased to approximately 0.75-0.8 to reflect this risk. The overall security risk is high, and caution should be exercised when importing modules from untrusted sources. Proper validation, sandboxing, or restrictions are recommended to mitigate this vulnerability."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of shell completion support. No malware or obfuscation detected. The primary security consideration is reliance on environment variables for flow control, which is typical but should be managed carefully. Overall, the code poses a very low security risk and is safe for use in standard environments."
