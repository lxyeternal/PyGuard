{
  "purpose": "This code defines type utility functions for Python, mainly for handling type hints and checking types such as Union, Literal, and NoneType, with compatibility for multiple Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads Python version information from sys.version_info, imports type-related functions from the typing module or typing_extensions, and defines several utility functions that operate on types.",
  "sinks": "The functions primarily operate on type objects and do not handle untrusted input directly. No sinks such as network, file, or environment interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves and processes type annotations and constants; it doesn't process external data or execute untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains version-dependent conditional logic to handle Python compatibility issues, but no suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily provides utility functions for type checking across different Python versions. It uses conditional imports and definitions based on Python version info. No input/output operations, network calls, or system modifications are present. The functions are designed for type inspection and are consistent with standard practices. The only potential concern could be the use of version checks, but these are standard for compatibility and not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility and utility module for Python type hints with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to assist with type introspection and does not include any suspicious or harmful operations.",
