{
  "purpose": "This code provides type inspection utilities for Python, supporting different Python versions and handling typing constructs like Union, Literal, Annotated, and get_origin/get_args functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads from sys.version_info for version checks, imports from typing and typing_extensions, and uses get_origin, get_args, get_type_hints functions for type inspection.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on untrusted input; the code mainly performs static type analysis.",
  "flows": "The code's flow involves version-based conditional imports, type checking functions, and recursive literal value extraction, without any data flow that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes version-dependent conditional definitions, which could indicate complex compatibility handling but do not suggest malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static utility module for type introspection, adapted from pydantic, with version-specific handling for Python features. It performs safe operations such as type comparisons and recursive data extraction. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code injections. All functions serve explicit, benign purposes related to type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module designed for type inspection across multiple Python versions. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. It seems to be a carefully implemented compatibility layer for type introspection with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
