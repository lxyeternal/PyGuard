{
  "purpose": "This code defines utility functions for type inspection and compatibility handling across different Python versions, specifically for the pydantic library's typing support.",
  "sources": "The code reads Python version information via sys.version_info and imports from the 'typing' and 'typing_extensions' modules, as well as local variables such as Literal, get_origin, get_args, and get_type_hints.",
  "sinks": "None apparent. No untrusted data input, network communication, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code flows from version checks to conditional imports and function definitions that depend on the Python version, ultimately providing utility functions like is_union, is_none_type, is_callable_type, and others.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. The code primarily performs version-dependent imports and simple type checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version-dependent imports and defines several utility functions for type checking, including is_union, is_none_type, is_callable_type, is_literal_type, and functions to extract literal values. The functions rely on standard Python modules and well-understood mechanisms. No obfuscation, hidden code, or external dependencies that could be malicious are found. The code appears to be standard, maintained utility code for type handling, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for handling Python type annotations across different Python versions. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It is safe and appears to serve its intended purpose without security risks.",
