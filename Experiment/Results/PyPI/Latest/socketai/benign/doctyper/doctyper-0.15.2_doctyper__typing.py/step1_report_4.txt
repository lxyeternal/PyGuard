{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for type introspection and compatibility across Python versions, specifically handling typing features such as Union, Literal, and Annotated.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (sys, typing, typing_extensions), type hints, and version checks.",
  "sinks": "None; the code primarily performs type checks and definitions without any data output, network operations, or data storage.",
  "flows": "N/A; there are no source-to-sink data flows, no input/output or untrusted data handling involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; all functions are standard utility functions for type checking and compatibility, with version-specific handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a subset of a type utility module, aiming to provide consistent type-related functions across various Python versions. It uses version checks to determine implementation strategies for functions like 'is_union' and 'is_none_type'. All functions perform straightforward, well-understood operations on type objects, such as comparing types or extracting arguments. There is no code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. The functions are safe and standard for type introspection tasks. No malicious intent or obfuscation is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for handling Python typing features, ensuring compatibility and consistent behavior across versions. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
