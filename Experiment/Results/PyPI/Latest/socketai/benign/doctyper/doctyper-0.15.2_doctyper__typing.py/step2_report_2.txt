  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Type utility functions supporting Python version compatibility.\n- Sources: Reads sys.version_info, imports from typing and typing_extensions.\n- Sinks: None, no data handling.\n- Flows: Static type analysis, no untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies, straightforward code.\n- Analysis: Functions perform type checks and data extraction; no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign, compatibility-focused utility code.\n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Type inspection utilities, handling various Python versions.\n- Sources: Version checks, typing modules.\n- Sinks: No data sinks.\n- Flows: Static analysis, no data flow issues.\n- Anomalies: Version-dependent logic, but standard.\n- Analysis: Safe, static type analysis functions, no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Benign, utility module.\n- Confidence: 0.9, Malware: 0, Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Type introspection and compatibility.\n- Sources: sys.version_info, typing modules.\n- Sinks: No data sinks.\n- Flows: No data flow issues.\n- Anomalies: Version-dependent code, but normal.\n- Analysis: Safe, standard type utility functions.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Type utility functions for Python versions.\n- Sources: Standard modules, version checks.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static analysis, no data handling.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Safe, straightforward functions.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no risks.\n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Type handling and compatibility.\n- Sources: Version info, typing modules.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: No data flow issues.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior.\n- Analysis: Standard utility code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n**Code Content:**\n- The code is a collection of type utility functions supporting compatibility across Python versions.\n- It performs type checks like `is_union`, `is_none_type`, `is_literal_type`, and extracts literal values.\n- It uses version checks to adapt to different Python environments.\n- There are no data sinks, network activity, or data handling of untrusted input.\n- The functions are straightforward, relying on standard Python features and well-documented behaviors.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation:**\n- No obfuscation or malicious code detected.\n- No suspicious or hidden logic.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-maintained utility module.\n\n**Risk and Security:**\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or modify system state.\n- The purpose is purely static type analysis, which is benign.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- Malware score: **0** — no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score: **0** — clear, straightforward code.\n- Risk score: **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the assessments in the reports. The code is a benign, compatibility-focused utility module for Python type introspection with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat.",
