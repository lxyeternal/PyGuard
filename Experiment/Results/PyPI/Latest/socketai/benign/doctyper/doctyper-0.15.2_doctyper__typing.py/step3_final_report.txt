  "purpose": "Utility functions for type introspection and compatibility across Python versions, supporting type checking such as is_union, is_none_type, is_literal_type, and extracting literal values.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, typing, typing_extensions modules, and version-dependent conditional imports and definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external data handling, network activity, or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "The functions operate solely on type objects and version info without external data flow or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard version checks and type utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility utility module derived from pydantic, providing type-related functions that adapt to different Python versions. It performs static type checks and data extraction, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The functions are simple, well-documented, and rely on standard Python features. No external data or system interactions are present, and the code serves purely for type introspection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and intended solely for static type analysis and compatibility. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriately zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
