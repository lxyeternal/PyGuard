{
  "purpose": "Extends 'click' and 'Typer' for CLI with rich formatting, autocompletion, shell completion, and enhanced help handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, function parameters (like autocompletion callbacks), sys.argv, context data, module imports.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit(), click.echo(), sys.stdout/stderr, environment variables, rich_utils formatting functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables, user-defined callbacks, command-line arguments, and context into command execution, help, and completion logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity. Callback functions could execute arbitrary code if malicious, but this is standard in CLI frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured extension of 'click' and 'Typer' for CLI enhancements, focusing on rich formatting, autocompletion, and help display. Exception handling is controlled, and no malicious or obfuscated code is present. The potential risk from user callbacks is inherent in such systems but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-driven CLI extension with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to the inherent risks of executing user-provided callbacks, which is standard in CLI frameworks.",
