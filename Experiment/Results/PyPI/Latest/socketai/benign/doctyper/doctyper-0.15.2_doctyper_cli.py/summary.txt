  "conclusion": "The code itself is not malicious but employs a pattern (dynamic import and execution) that can be exploited to run malicious code if untrusted modules are supplied. The malware score should be increased to approximately 0.75-0.8 to reflect this risk. The overall security risk is high, and caution should be exercised when importing modules from untrusted sources. Proper validation, sandboxing, or restrictions are recommended to mitigate this vulnerability."
