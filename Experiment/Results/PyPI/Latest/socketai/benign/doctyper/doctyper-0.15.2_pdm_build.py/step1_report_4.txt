  "purpose": "Configure and initialize package build metadata based on environment variables and project configuration, including dependency management and custom build settings.",
  "sources": "os.getenv() for environment variable; context.config for project metadata, dependencies, and custom configs",
  "sinks": "Assignments to metadata['dependencies'] and context.config.build_config, which could influence package dependencies and build parameters",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'TIANGOLO_BUILD_PACKAGE' influences package selection; dependency list is extended and versioned based on sync dependencies and version info; configuration data is read and applied to build metadata and config",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code mainly manipulates configuration data and dependencies without executing external or dangerous code. No suspicious code injections or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script reads environment variables to determine package type, then manipulates package metadata, dependencies, and build configuration based on structured configuration data. It appends version constraints to dependencies if they are part of a sync list. The logic is straightforward, with no external calls beyond standard environment and configuration data access. No malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system manipulation is evident. The code's purpose is to dynamically set build parameters and dependencies, which appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard configuration management for package building without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It only modifies local build metadata and dependencies based on provided configuration data and environment variables. No malware or security risks identified.",
