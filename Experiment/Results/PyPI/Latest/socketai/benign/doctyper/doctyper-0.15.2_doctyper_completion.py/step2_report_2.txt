  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, confirming the presence or absence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and ensuring consistency in scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages CLI shell completion installation and display, with environment variables and shell detection, no malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code uses standard patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior. The use of sys.exit after actions is typical for CLI tools. The environment variable `_TYPER_COMPLETE_TEST_DISABLE_SHELL_DETECTION` is for testing, not malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — reasonable given the benign nature. The risk score is low but not zero, considering potential external dependencies.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is valid; the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on CLI completion, with environment variables and external dependencies. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the standard structure, the optional shell detection, and the use of callbacks. No suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code facilitating shell completion scripts, with environment variables, external functions, and no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly points out the external dependencies (`install()`, `get_completion_script()`) and their potential risks if compromised, but within this code snippet, no malicious logic is present.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes CLI completion setup, with environment variables, callbacks, and standard patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The use of environment variables is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, focusing on completion script management, with environment variables and external functions.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning correctly emphasizes the standard use of environment variables, callbacks, and external dependencies. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — slightly lower, reflecting the benign assessment.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary & Final Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code does not contain any malicious payload, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern. Given the code's purpose and the lack of malicious activity, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — low, consistent with benign CLI utility code.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard CLI completion utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation.**",
