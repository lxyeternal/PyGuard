  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages CLI shell completion installation and display, with environment variables, shell detection, and external functions.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. Uses sys.exit after actions, which is standard. Shell detection is conditional but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9. The security risk is low; the malware score is zero, indicating no malicious code detected.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, focusing on CLI completion setup with 'click', environment variables, and external dependencies.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code or backdoors. Use of assert for 'prog_name' could cause termination if missing but isn't malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears legitimate. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Provides CLI utilities for installing/displaying shell completion scripts, with environment variables and external functions.\n- **Findings:** No signs of data leaks, network activity, or malicious code. External functions (install, get_completion_script) are outside scope but are called in a standard way.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar functionality, managing shell completion scripts with environment variables and callbacks.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Uses standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, CLI completion management with environment variables, external dependencies, and output handling.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code or malicious behavior. Uses environment variables for test purposes, which is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Legitimate utility code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code does not contain any obfuscated, suspicious, or malicious segments.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, around 0.1–0.2, reflecting typical CLI utility risks but no significant security concerns.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9), given the consistent findings across reports.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of CLI shell completion utilities using 'click' and 'typer'.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- External dependencies (like 'install' and 'get_completion_script') are outside this code scope but are called in a safe, standard manner.\n- Use of environment variables for test behavior is common and not suspicious.\n- The use of sys.exit after actions is typical for CLI tools.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Category        | Final Score |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| Malware         | 0            |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1 – 0.2    |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and performs expected CLI completion management functions. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile external functions like `install()` and `get_completion_script()` are outside this review, their safe use is critical. Based on the provided code and reports, no malicious intent is detected.",
