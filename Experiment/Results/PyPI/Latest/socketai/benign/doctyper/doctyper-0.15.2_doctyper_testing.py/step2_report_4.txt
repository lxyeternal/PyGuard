  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports show \"Empty response\" with no raw response content.\n- Since no detailed report content is provided, I cannot identify specific issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors from the reports alone.\n- The code itself appears to be a straightforward wrapper around `click.testing.CliRunner`, with a custom `invoke` method that calls `_get_command(app)` before invoking the parent method.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and record errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary**\n\n- The reports contain no detailed information—only \"Empty response\"—which prevents meaningful analysis.\n- The lack of details makes it impossible to verify whether any issues are present or if the report is valid.\n- No reasoning or explanation is provided in the reports, which limits the ability to assess the severity or correctness.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores given to each issue and suggest changes**\n\n- Since no issues are detailed, no scores are provided, but the absence of data suggests no basis for scoring.\n- If any scores were assigned, they would be arbitrary without evidence.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any risk score higher than 0.5**\n\n- Without concrete evidence of vulnerabilities, malware, or flaws, assigning a high risk score would be unjustified.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate wrapper around testing utilities, with no obvious malicious or dangerous behavior.\n\n**Step 5: Pay attention to the malware score**\n\n- No evidence of malicious activity is present.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or other suspicious actions.\n- The only potential concern could be the use of `_get_command`, but without its implementation or context, there's no reason to suspect malicious intent.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge claims based on assumptions**\n\n- Since reports are empty, any assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware would be unfounded.\n- The code looks standard and safe, assuming `_get_command` is a legitimate function.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency between scores and report content**\n\n- No scores are provided, but the lack of information suggests no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — no identifiable vulnerabilities or issues.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nGiven the lack of detailed reports and the straightforward nature of the code, there is no indication of security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports seem to be placeholders or incomplete, and based on the available data, the code appears safe and well-structured.\n\n**Recommendation:** No action needed. If further details are provided, re-evaluate accordingly.",
