{
  "purpose": "Wrapper around click.testing.CliRunner to invoke commands from a Typer app with customized command retrieval.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to invoke method, especially app, args, input, env, and the result of _get_command(app).",
  "sinks": "The invoke method calls super().invoke with the command obtained from _get_command(app); no untrusted data handling or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> _get_command(app) -> super().invoke(use_cli, ...) -> command execution; no external or malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of _get_command from doctyper.main; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; reports are empty, providing no additional context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward subclass of click.testing.CliRunner, overriding invoke to retrieve a command via _get_command and then invoke it. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The reports provided are empty, lacking details or evidence of issues. The code does not perform network operations, file manipulations, or other malicious actions. The reliance on external functions appears standard, and the code is clear and well-structured. Given the absence of any indicators of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation, the overall security posture is safe. The scores should reflect no malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign wrapper for testing CLI commands, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The reports are empty and do not provide evidence to challenge this assessment. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
