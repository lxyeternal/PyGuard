  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Vulnerable Code:**\n   - The provided code appears to be a straightforward wrapper around the `click.testing.CliRunner`, with an override of the `invoke` method to incorporate custom command retrieval via `_get_command`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors. The code's purpose seems to be enhancing testability for CLI applications built with `click` and `doctyper`.\n   - No vulnerabilities, such as insecure input handling or code injection, are evident from this snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code is clean and functional for its intended purpose.\n   - The only potential concern is the reliance on `_get_command(app)`, which is imported from `doctyper.main`. Without knowing its implementation, there's a minimal risk if `_get_command` performs unsafe operations, but this cannot be determined from the snippet alone.\n   - The use of `# noqa` suggests an intentional suppression of linter warnings, which is acceptable here.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is clear and readable.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no evident security risk.\n\n4. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All reports are \"Empty response\" with no additional details.\n   - This indicates that the reports lack substance, making it impossible to identify any issues based on the provided data.\n\n5. **Summary and Recommendations:**\n   - Given the code and the reports, there is no evidence of security issues or malicious intent.\n   - The absence of detailed responses from the reports suggests either a lack of analysis or incomplete reports.\n   - The current scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n\n**Note:** Always verify the implementation of imported functions like `_get_command` for completeness, but based solely on this snippet, there are no security concerns.",
