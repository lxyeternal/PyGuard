  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Potential Issues:**\n   - The code appears to be a wrapper around the `click.testing.CliRunner`, customizing the `invoke` method to work with a `Typer` app.\n   - The `_get_command` function is used to extract the command from the `Typer` app before invoking it.\n   - There are no obvious security vulnerabilities, such as code injection, malicious code execution, or insecure handling of inputs.\n   - The code relies on external libraries (`click`, `doctyper`) which are standard for CLI testing and Typer applications.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - All reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response content. This suggests that the reports lack detailed information or the reports themselves are incomplete.\n   - Since the reports do not contain any specific error messages, code snippets, or evidence of malicious activity, it's impossible to determine if there's an actual security concern.\n   - The absence of detailed responses or context makes it difficult to verify whether the code has vulnerabilities or issues.\n\n3. **Score Justification & Recommendations:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0.0 — There is no indication of malicious behavior, such as code that downloads, executes, or exfiltrates data.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — The code is straightforward and readable; no obfuscation is present.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Given the lack of detailed reports and evidence, the risk appears minimal. However, the code does involve invoking commands dynamically, which can be risky if the input is not sanitized in broader contexts. Since this is a testing wrapper, the risk remains low.\n\n4. **Critical Observations:**\n   - The reports are essentially empty, providing no actionable information.\n   - Without concrete evidence, claims of vulnerabilities or malicious activity are unfounded.\n   - The code itself is standard for testing CLI applications and does not exhibit any obvious security flaws.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Score | Justification                                                  |\n|-----------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0.0     | No malicious activity detected or implied.                       |\n| Obfuscated     | 0.0     | Code is clear and straightforward.                                |\n| Risk           | 0.1     | Very low risk; potential issues depend on broader context, but none evident here. |\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the lack of detailed report content, the scores remain low. If future reports include specific vulnerabilities, code snippets, or malicious indicators, a reassessment would be necessary.",
