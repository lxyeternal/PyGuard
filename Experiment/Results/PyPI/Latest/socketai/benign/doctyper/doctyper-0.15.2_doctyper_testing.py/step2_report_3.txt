  "review": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Vulnerable Code:**\n   - The provided code appears to be a straightforward wrapper around the `click.testing.CliRunner`, customizing the `invoke` method to utilize a specific command obtained via `_get_command(app)`.\n   - There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or exploitation mechanisms. The code primarily facilitates testing of CLI applications built with `click` and `doctyper`.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code itself is syntactically correct and logically sound for its purpose.\n   - It correctly overrides the `invoke` method, retrieves the command with `_get_command`, and calls the superclass's `invoke` with the appropriate parameters.\n   - No obvious flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All reports indicate `\"error\": \"Empty response\"` with no additional details.\n   - The raw responses are empty, providing no context or evidence of issues.\n   - Since the reports contain no meaningful information, they do not support any claims of vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Given the lack of evidence, any high malware or risk scores would be unjustified.\n   - The code itself does not exhibit malicious behavior or vulnerabilities based on the provided snippet.\n   - The reports do not provide enough information to assess risks; thus, scores should be low or zero.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code appears benign and well-structured.\n   - The reports are uninformative, providing no grounds for concern.\n   - The malware score should be **0**, as there is no indication of malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score should be **0**, since the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The risk score should be **0**, reflecting no evident security issues.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis analysis is based solely on the provided code and reports. If additional context or details from the raw responses become available, reassessment may be necessary.",
