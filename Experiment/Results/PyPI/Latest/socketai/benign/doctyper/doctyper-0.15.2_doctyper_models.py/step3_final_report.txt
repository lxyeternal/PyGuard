  "purpose": "Structural class and type definitions for CLI using 'click' and 'typer'.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, type annotations, and internal placeholders; no external data input or runtime logic.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flows or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Structural data flow within class initializations; no external or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions, type variables, and utility functions for CLI configuration. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, or system modifications. The 'shell_complete' methods are stubbed to return empty lists, which is safe. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation patterns are present. The code appears to be boilerplate scaffolding for CLI applications, with internal placeholders and type annotations. The overall structure and content indicate a benign, standard framework component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated CLI scaffolding module. It poses minimal security risk, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.1) accurately reflects the static, structural nature of the code. The high confidence score (close to 1) is justified given the absence of any malicious or suspicious patterns.",
