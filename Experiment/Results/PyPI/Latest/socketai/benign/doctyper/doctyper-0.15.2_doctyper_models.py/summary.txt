  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated CLI scaffolding module. It poses minimal security risk, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.1) accurately reflects the static, structural nature of the code. The high confidence score (close to 1) is justified given the absence of any malicious or suspicious patterns."
