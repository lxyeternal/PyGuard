  "purpose": "Define color constants as string variables for use in terminal or display formatting.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; only variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or output operations involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward variable assignments with no hidden or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments mapping color names to string literals. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The variables are used for defining constants related to colors, likely for formatting purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is simple, static, and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic declaration of color constants with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility module for color configuration.",
