  "purpose": "Define color constants for formatting or display purposes.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments of color name strings to constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; static constant definitions with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments mapping color names to string literals, with no functions, input/output operations, dynamic code, or external data interactions. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code serves as a utility constants module for color formatting, posing no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of color name constants with no malicious intent or security risks. The current assessment scores are appropriate and justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
