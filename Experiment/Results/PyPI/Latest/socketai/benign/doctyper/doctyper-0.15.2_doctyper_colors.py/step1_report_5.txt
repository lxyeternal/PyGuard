  "purpose": "Define color-related string constants for use in a larger application, likely for text formatting or display purposes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only variable definitions with string literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; all are simple constant assignments.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no processing or logic beyond constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behaviors observed; the code is straightforward variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns string literals representing color names to variables with descriptive names. It serves as a color palette or theme setup, which is common in UI or terminal formatting scripts. There are no dynamic features, external inputs, or complex logic. The naming conventions are clear and consistent. No obfuscated code, malicious constructs, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of constant definitions for color strings. It appears to be part of a larger application for UI or console output formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
