  "purpose": "Define color names as string constants for use in colorized output.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments defining color names.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments mapping color-related identifiers to string values representing colors. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external interactions, and no suspicious behavior. The structure is straightforward, typical for defining constants in a module. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a constants module for color names. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
