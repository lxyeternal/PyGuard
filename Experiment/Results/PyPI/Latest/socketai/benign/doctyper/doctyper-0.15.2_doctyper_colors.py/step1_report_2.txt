  "purpose": "Define color constants for use in terminal or UI color schemes",

  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only assigns string values to variables",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; simple assignments only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant definitions",
  "analysis": "The code assigns string literals representing color names to variables, presumably for use in a larger application for coloring output. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or other suspicious behaviors. No obfuscated or malicious code elements are present. The code appears to be benign and purely definitional.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple set of constant definitions for color labels, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
