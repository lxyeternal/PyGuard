  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data transformation occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code simply assigns string values to variables.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of variable assignments mapping color names to string literals. There are no functions, input/output operations, external data reads, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be part of a larger display or formatting library. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of variable definitions for color constants. It poses no security threats, no malicious intent, and no suspicious behavior. It is benign and intended for display formatting purposes.",
