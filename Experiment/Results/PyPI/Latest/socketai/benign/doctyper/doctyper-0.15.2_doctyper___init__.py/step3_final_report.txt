{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a CLI framework by importing various functions and classes from external libraries ('click', 'shutil') and internal modules, defining versioning and references for CLI components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'click', 'shutil', and internal modules; version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or output handling present.",
  "flows": "Imports and references without data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static setup code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and module references, with no dynamic execution, user input handling, or network activity. All imported modules are reputable, and the code functions as a setup module for a CLI framework. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The high confidence scores reflect the straightforward nature of the code, and the low malware and risk scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup module for a CLI framework with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
