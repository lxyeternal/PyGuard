{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up a CLI framework using the Typer library, importing various functions and classes for CLI interactions and utility functions, as well as internal modules for core functionality and models.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries 'click' and 'shutil', as well as internal modules '.main', '.models', and '.params'. No untrusted input sources are evident within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks, command execution, or malicious behavior are present. The code primarily performs imports and assigns class/function references.",
  "flows": "The code does not demonstrate any data flow from sources to sinks. It only establishes references and imports functions and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code are present. All imports are from well-known libraries or internal modules, with no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs imports of modules from external libraries ('click' and 'shutil') and internal package components. It defines a version string and imports functions and classes related to CLI UI, utilities, and internal models. There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or other suspicious operations. The code looks standard for a CLI application setup, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup for a Python CLI framework, with no malicious intent, suspicious code, or security risks detected. It only establishes references and imports, with no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
