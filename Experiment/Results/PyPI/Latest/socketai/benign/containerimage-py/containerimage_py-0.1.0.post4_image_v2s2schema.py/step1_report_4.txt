  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for validating Docker v2s2 manifest, manifest list, and related entries.",
  "sources": "Import statements for schema components, schema definitions, and string literals within schema properties.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; schemas are static definitions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; schemas are static data structures used for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected. The import statement is standard, and schema definitions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports schema components and defines JSON schemas for Docker manifest types. All operations are static schema definitions with no data processing, external calls, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The schema strings are standard descriptions, and no dynamic or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of JSON schema definitions for Docker v2s2 manifests and manifest lists. No malicious intent or security risks are apparent based on static analysis.",
