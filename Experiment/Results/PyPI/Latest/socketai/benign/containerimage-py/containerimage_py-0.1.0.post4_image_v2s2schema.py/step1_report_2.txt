{
  "purpose": "Defines JSON schema constants for validating Docker v2s2 manifests, manifest list entries, and manifest lists.",
  "sources": "Import statement for schemas from 'image.manifestschema'; local schema definitions for manifest components.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed or exposed; schemas are for validation purposes only.",
  "flows": "Schemas are static definitions; no dynamic data flows or processing that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The schemas are standard and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of JSON schema definitions with descriptive comments, imports, and constants. There is no dynamic code execution, external network access, or processing of untrusted data. The import statement points to a local module, likely for reuse of schema components. No code appears malicious or attempts to sabotage system behavior. The content appears to be straightforward schema definitions for validating Docker manifest data structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static schema definitions for validation. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
