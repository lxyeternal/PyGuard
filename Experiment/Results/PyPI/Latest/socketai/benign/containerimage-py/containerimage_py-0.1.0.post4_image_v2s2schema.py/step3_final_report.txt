  "purpose": "Static JSON schema definitions for Docker v2s2 manifests, manifest list entries, and manifest lists used for validation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'image.manifestschema' for schema components.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data processing, no untrusted data handling, no external network calls.",
  "flows": "N/A - static schema definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; schemas are well-structured, documented, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static JSON schema definitions for Docker manifests, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data manipulation. Import statements reference local schema components, which are standard for schema reuse. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The schemas are correctly structured with appropriate types and required fields. The reports' assessments of malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of JSON schema definitions for Docker v2s2 manifests, free from malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports' evaluations and scores are accurate and justified.",
