  "purpose": "Define JSON schema constants for validating Docker v2s2 manifests, manifest list entries, and manifest lists.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external schemas: 'image.manifestschema'. No other input sources present.",
  "sinks": "None; no code writes or executes based on untrusted data within this file.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; schemas are static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code primarily consists of static schema definitions and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports predefined schemas and defines JSON schemas for Docker manifest v2s2 components. These schemas specify data structures for validation purposes. The code is well-structured, includes detailed comments and links, and does not contain any dynamic code execution, network calls, or data manipulation. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. It appears to be standard schema definitions for container image validation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign set of JSON schema definitions used for validating Docker image manifests. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
