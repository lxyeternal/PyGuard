  "purpose": "Define JSON schema constants for validating Docker v2s2 manifests, manifest list entries, and manifest lists.",
  "sources": "Import statements from image.manifestschema; JSON schema definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; schemas are static definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; schemas are used for validation only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static JSON schema definitions for Docker manifest validation, imported schemas, and descriptive comments. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling. The import statement is standard, and schemas are well-formed. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The code strictly defines data validation schemas without any runtime logic that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, defining validation schemas for Docker manifests with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a Docker or container image validation library.",
