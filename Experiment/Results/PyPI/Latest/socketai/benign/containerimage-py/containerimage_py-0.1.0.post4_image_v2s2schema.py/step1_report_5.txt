{
  "purpose": "Defines JSON schema constants for validating Docker v2s2 manifests, manifest lists, and manifest list entries.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'image.manifestschema' module; schema definitions within the file.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used in a vulnerable way.",
  "flows": "Schemas are static definitions; no dynamic data flow or untrusted data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Schemas are standard, well-documented, and purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains JSON schema definitions for Docker manifest types. It imports schemas from another module but does not execute or process untrusted data. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no obfuscated or malicious code structures are present. The schemas specify data formats for validation purposes only, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of JSON schema definitions for Docker manifests. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It serves as validation schema definitions and does not perform any runtime actions that could be malicious.",
