{
  "purpose": "The code defines a base class for handling container image manifests, including methods for retrieving layer descriptors, configuration descriptors, media type, and size calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'manifest' dictionary passed during initialization, specifically keys such as 'layers', 'config', and 'mediaType'.",
  "sinks": "The code creates instances of ContainerImageDescriptor with data extracted from the manifest; no external sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input 'manifest' dictionary into the creation of descriptors and calculations of sizes, but no untrusted data is passed to external systems or sensitive APIs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures. The code primarily handles data parsing and object creation with standard Python constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a data parser and container for image manifest information, with no evident malicious logic. It securely handles data by simply converting dictionary entries into objects and performing basic calculations. No external network or system commands are invoked. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a straightforward implementation for managing container image manifests. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code primarily processes and formats data without side effects.",
