{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for container image manifests to parse and access manifest data such as layers, config descriptors, media type, and size.",
  "sources": "Input manifest dictionary passed during class instantiation; manifest.get() calls to retrieve data fields",
  "sinks": "None directly present; no output or untrusted data being sent to external systems or network",
  "flows": "Constructor receives manifest -> get_layer_descriptors/get_config_descriptor retrieve data from manifest -> other methods process and return data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a data wrapper around a container image manifest, extracting layer information, configuration, media type, and size. It uses standard data access patterns without executing or evaluating untrusted data beyond basic retrieval. There are no indicators of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or malicious control flow. The class methods are passive and solely interpret the provided manifest dictionary. The design does not include network calls, file operations, or other potentially malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign class for parsing container image manifests with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions purely as a data access layer with no evidence of sabotage, backdoors, or malware.",
