{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for container image manifests, allowing extraction of layer descriptors, configuration, media type, and size.",
  "sources": "The manifest dictionary provided during instantiation, accessed in methods like get_layer_descriptors, get_config_descriptor, get_media_type, and get_size.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not pass untrusted data to external systems, perform network operations, or write sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input manifest dictionary to various methods that process and return specific parts of the manifest data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present. The class functions are straightforward data accessors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a clear, standard implementation of a container image manifest handler. It reads manifest data, extracts layers and config descriptors, calculates total size, and converts data to JSON. There are no signs of malicious logic, obfuscated code, or malicious data handling. No external inputs are used beyond the provided manifest dictionary, and no network or file operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured utility class for handling container image manifests. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
