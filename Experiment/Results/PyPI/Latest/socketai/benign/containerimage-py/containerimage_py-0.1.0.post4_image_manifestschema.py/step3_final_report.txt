  "purpose": "Static JSON schema definitions for OCI container image descriptors and platform specifications used for validation.",
  "sources": "Definitions of schema constants such as MANIFEST_DESCRIPTOR_SCHEMA and IMAGE_INDEX_ENTRY_PLATFORM_SCHEMA.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; schemas are purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; schemas are static and used for validation purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is static data definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static Python dictionaries defining JSON schemas for OCI descriptors and platform info. There are no executable components, data processing, network activity, or embedded secrets. The schemas are well-documented, adhere to standards, and are referenced appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of static schema definitions for container image validation, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
