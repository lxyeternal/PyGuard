  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for validating OCI container image descriptors and platform information.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded schema definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; schemas are static definitions used for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected. Schemas are standard and descriptive.",
  "analysis": "The code contains JSON schema definitions for validating container image descriptors and platform specifications. All schemas are static, hardcoded data structures without dynamic execution or external input handling. No indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or credential handling. It appears to be well-structured documentation for validation purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely schema definitions for JSON validation and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe and standard for its purpose.",
