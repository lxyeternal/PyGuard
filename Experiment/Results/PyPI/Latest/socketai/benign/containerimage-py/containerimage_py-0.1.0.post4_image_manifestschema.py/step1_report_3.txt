  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for validating container image descriptors and index entries.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; schemas are static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A, schemas are static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The schemas are straightforward definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of JSON schema definitions for validating container image descriptors and platform specifications. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks. The schemas include descriptions, property definitions, and requirements, with no indication of malicious or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code, suspicious strings, or runtime behaviors are present. The code is purely declarative and for validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard schema definitions for container image validation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
