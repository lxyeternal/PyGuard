  "purpose": "Define JSON schema constants for validating OCI image descriptors and platform specifications in container image manifests and indexes.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code solely defines static schema objects.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or data sinks; static schema definitions without dynamic or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow present; schemas are static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the schemas appear standard and well-documented, with no suspicious fields or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static Python dictionary definitions representing JSON schemas for container image components. It includes detailed descriptions and validation rules for descriptors and platform information. There is no dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity. The schemas are well-formed, use standard JSON schema syntax, and are accompanied by references and documentation comments. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated elements, or signs of malicious behavior. The overall structure and content align with standard container image schema definitions, with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static schema definition module for container image validation. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The schemas serve as standard validation tools without any security risks.",
