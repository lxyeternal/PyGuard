{
  "purpose": "Defines JSON schemas for OCI image descriptors and platform specifications for validation and structure enforcement.",
  "sources": "Static schema definitions within the Python code, no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations, only schema definitions used for validation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as schemas are static and for validation only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior detected. The code is purely declarative schema definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static JSON schema definitions used for validating OCI image manifests and indexes. There are no dynamic inputs, no external data processing, and no executable code that could be exploited. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable misuse, or malicious instructions are present. The schemas are well-documented, standard, and do not include any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The code serves its purpose of defining validation schemas without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, only providing static JSON schema definitions for OCI image validation. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
