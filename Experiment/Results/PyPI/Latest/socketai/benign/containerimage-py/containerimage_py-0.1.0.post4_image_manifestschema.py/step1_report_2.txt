{
  "purpose": "Defines JSON schemas for OCI image manifest descriptors and platform information used for validating container image metadata.",
  "sources": "The code itself is static and contains no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; the code only defines schema constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since this is schema definition code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the schemas are standard and well-documented. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of JSON schema definitions for container image descriptors and platform specifications, which are static constants. These schemas include detailed descriptions and property specifications, with no executable code, data handling, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The schemas are used for validation purposes within container tooling. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of JSON schemas for container image metadata. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks present. It appears to be standard, safe schema definition code.",
