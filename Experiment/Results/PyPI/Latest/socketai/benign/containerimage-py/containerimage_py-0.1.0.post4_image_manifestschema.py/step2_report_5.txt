  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is static schema definitions for OCI image descriptors.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, no data processing, no network activity, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified, as no security risk or malicious behavior is present.\n- **Comments:** The report is accurate. The schemas are standard, well-documented, and safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Defines JSON schemas for OCI image index entries and platform info.\n- **Findings:** Static, no external data or code execution, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** Correct assessment; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Schema definitions for container image descriptors and platform specifications.\n- **Findings:** Static, no dynamic code, no external interactions, no secrets.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** Accurate; the schemas are safe and standard.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Validation schemas for OCI images and indexes.\n- **Findings:** Static, no runtime code, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** Correct; no security concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Schema definitions for OCI descriptors and platform info.\n- **Findings:** Static, no dynamic execution, no secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static schema definitions.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, risk = 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n- The detailed descriptions and references further support the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code is safe, standard schema definitions used for validating container image metadata.",
