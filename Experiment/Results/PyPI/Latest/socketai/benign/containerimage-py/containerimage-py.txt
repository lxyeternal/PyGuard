      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured factory pattern for container image manifests with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The low security risk score (~0.2) is justified due to reliance on external validation and the potential for data leakage in error messages, but no active malicious behavior is detected."

The only potential concern is reliance on external data sources when fetching manifests, which is typical in container registry workflows. Overall, it is safe and benign."
