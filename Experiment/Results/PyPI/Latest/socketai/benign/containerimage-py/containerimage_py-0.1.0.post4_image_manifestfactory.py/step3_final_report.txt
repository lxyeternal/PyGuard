  "purpose": "Factory pattern implementation for creating container image manifest objects based on input schema.",
  "sources": "Input dictionary 'manifest_or_list' passed to 'create' method; external validation static methods in each class.",
  "sinks": "Exception message containing JSON dump of input, which could potentially leak sensitive data if input is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated via static methods; upon success, object is instantiated; on failure, exception with JSON dump is raised.",
  "anomalies": "Use of JSON dump in exception message could expose sensitive data; reliance on external validation methods assumes their safety.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward factory pattern that validates input schemas with external static methods before instantiating corresponding classes. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The exception message includes the entire input data, which could leak sensitive information if inputs are untrusted, but this is typical for debugging and not malicious. The validation steps are standard, and the code structure is clear. External validation methods are assumed safe; if compromised, risks could arise, but within this context, no malicious activity is evident. The overall security risk is low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured factory pattern for container image manifests with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The low security risk score (~0.2) is justified due to reliance on external validation and the potential for data leakage in error messages, but no active malicious behavior is detected.",
