{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules related to container image processing, schemas, descriptors, and manifests, likely for setup or initialization purposes in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'image' package and its submodules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only imports modules without processing data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this snippet; import statements do not establish source-to-sink data paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a container image-related package. There are no functions, data manipulations, network calls, or executable logic. The absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns indicates benign intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2). Confidence levels are high (0.9-1), consistent with the limited code scope. No signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores are justified and align with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of import statements for container image modules, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the overall assessment confirms the benign nature of this dependency fragment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
