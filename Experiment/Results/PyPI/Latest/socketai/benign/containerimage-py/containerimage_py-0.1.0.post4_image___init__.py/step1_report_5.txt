{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import various modules related to image handling, configuration, and schemas, likely for processing container images or OCI-compliant images.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules within the 'image' package, which may load or initialize related components when the package is used.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks are evident in the import statements alone.",
  "flows": "There are no executable flows or data processing paths visible in the import statements; these only set up the environment for further operations.",
  "anomalies": "All imports are from standard, seemingly benign modules within the 'image' package; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is static import statements with no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for various modules related to image and OCI specifications. No functions, variables, or executable code is provided. Without additional context, these imports appear standard for a package that manages container images. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activities. The imports do not show any external data sources or sinks, nor do they invoke any operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided import statements, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The code is benign and appears to set up modules for image processing tasks. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
