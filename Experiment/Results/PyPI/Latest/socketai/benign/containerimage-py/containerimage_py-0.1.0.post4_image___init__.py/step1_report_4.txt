{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules from the 'image' package, likely related to container images and schemas.",
  "sources": "The source of data is not explicitly shown; imports are static and do not read external data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible, as the code only contains import statements without further logic.",
  "anomalies": "All imports are from a single package namespace; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns are present. The imported modules seem to be standard or related to container image schemas.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for a collection of modules under the 'image' namespace. There is no logic, data processing, or external data sources involved in this snippet. The imports cover various aspects of container images and schemas, which are typical in image processing or container management tools. No signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious activity are detected based solely on import statements.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign set of import statements for modules related to container image schemas. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
