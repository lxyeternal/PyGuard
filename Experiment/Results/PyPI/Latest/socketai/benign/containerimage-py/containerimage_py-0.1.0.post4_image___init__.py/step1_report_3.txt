{
  "purpose": "Import various modules related to image processing, container images, and schemas, likely for handling container image formats such as OCI or Docker images.",
  "sources": "Import statements at the beginning of the code, importing modules from the 'image' package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or functions are invoked in this snippet; it is purely import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling observed, as this is only import statements without executable code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are detected in these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements of various 'image' modules, indicating preparatory setup for image processing. There are no functions, data manipulations, or network calls present. Since the code is limited to module imports, it does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The modules imported appear relevant to container image management and schema handling.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code simply imports modules related to container image processing, with no suspicious or malicious activity present.",
