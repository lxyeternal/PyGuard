  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, schema-based implementation for OCI container image validation and conversion, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. It performs necessary validation steps securely and transparently, making it safe for use. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk score reflects the benign nature of the routines."
