{
  "purpose": "Provides a class for validating and parsing container image references in remote registries.",
  "sources": "Input is the 'ref' string provided during class instantiation and method calls; regex patterns used for validation.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data; code primarily parses and validates references without external outputs or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'ref' -> validate via regex -> parse components (digest, tag, name, registry) -> return data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no network connections or external data leaks; no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code validates container image references using regex patterns imported from 'image.regex'. It parses tags, digests, registry names, and image paths without executing untrusted code or external calls. No data is transmitted or stored insecurely. The class strictly performs string validation and extraction, with proper validation checks and exception handling. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward reference parser with validation; it does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal; no suspicious activity is evident.",
