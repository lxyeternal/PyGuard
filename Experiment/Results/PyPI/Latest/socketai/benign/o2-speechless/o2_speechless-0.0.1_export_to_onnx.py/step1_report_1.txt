  "purpose": "Export a pre-trained pyannote model to ONNX format for inference or deployment.",
  "sources": "checkpoint path input via command line argument",
  "sinks": "ONNX output model file; inference session creation from the output model file",
  "flows": "checkpoint path -> Model.from_pretrained() -> torch.onnx.export() -> output file -> ort.InferenceSession()",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward export process with no unusual code or obfuscated patterns",
  "analysis": "The script loads a pre-trained model from a checkpoint, exports it to ONNX format, and creates an inference session. All actions are typical for model conversion workflows. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. The use of external libraries (pyannote.audio, torch, onnxruntime) is appropriate for this task. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious commands are evident. The code appears to perform a standard export procedure without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script for exporting a machine learning model to ONNX format. It contains no suspicious or malicious elements, and no security risks are evident.",
