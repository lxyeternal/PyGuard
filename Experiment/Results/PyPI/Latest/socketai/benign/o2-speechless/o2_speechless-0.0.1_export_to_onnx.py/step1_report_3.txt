  "purpose": "Export a pre-trained pyannote model to ONNX format for inference or deployment.",
  "sources": "checkpoint file path provided as command-line argument; model file path for output.",
  "sinks": "Model loading from checkpoint; exporting to ONNX; creating and running an ONNX Runtime session.",
  "flows": "Input checkpoint path -> Model.from_pretrained() -> Model object -> torch.onnx.export() -> output file -> ort.InferenceSession()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. Use of torch and onnxruntime appears standard. Commented out code line does not influence behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a model checkpoint specified by the user, then exports it to ONNX format using torch's export function. Afterwards, it creates an ONNX Runtime inference session with the exported model. All operations use standard libraries and functions without obfuscated or malicious constructs. No data leakage, network communication, or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform legitimate model export operations without any malicious intent or security issues. It is a straightforward utility script for exporting a model to ONNX format.",
