  "purpose": "Export a pre-trained pyannote model to ONNX format for inference or deployment.",
  "sources": "Reads checkpoint path from command line argument; loads model using Model.from_pretrained(checkpoint).",
  "sinks": "Exports model to specified output file; initializes ONNX Runtime session with the output file.",
  "flows": "checkpoint path -> Model.from_pretrained -> model object -> torch.onnx.export -> output file -> ort.InferenceSession",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. The code performs standard model export and inference session setup.",
  "analysis": "The script takes a checkpoint path as input, loads the model, creates a dummy tensor input, and exports the model to an ONNX file. It then initializes an ONNX Runtime session with the exported model. There are no signs of malicious data handling, code injection, or suspicious network activity. No use of environment variables, credentials, or insecure functions is present. The code appears straightforward and consistent with model export workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical model export procedure with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
