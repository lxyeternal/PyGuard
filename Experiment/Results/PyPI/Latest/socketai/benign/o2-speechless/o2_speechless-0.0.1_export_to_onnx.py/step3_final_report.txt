  "purpose": "Export a pre-trained pyannote model to ONNX format and initialize an inference session.",
  "sources": "Model checkpoint file input, model loading, and model export functions.",
  "sinks": "Model export output file, ONNX Runtime inference session initialization.",
  "flows": "Checkpoint file -> Model.from_pretrained -> torch.onnx.export -> ONNX file -> ort.InferenceSession",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a model checkpoint, exports it to ONNX format, and initializes an ONNX Runtime session. All operations are standard for model deployment workflows. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard utility for exporting a machine learning model with no security risks, malicious intent, or obfuscation detected. The code's behavior aligns with a safe deployment process.",
