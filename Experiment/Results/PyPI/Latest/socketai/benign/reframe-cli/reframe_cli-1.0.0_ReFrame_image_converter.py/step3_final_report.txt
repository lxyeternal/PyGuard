  "purpose": "A Python script for converting images between formats, supporting batch processing and HEIC/HEIF formats via 'pillow-heif'.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from specified path or directory; reads HEIC/HEIF images via pillow_heif when needed.",
  "sinks": "Writes converted images to output directory; deletes original files if in-place replacement is specified.",
  "flows": "Source: input image files; Process: reading and converting images; Sink: saving converted images, optionally removing originals.",
  "anomalies": "Uses sys.exit() during bulk processing errors, which could abruptly terminate processes but is not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image format conversions with proper error handling, dynamic import of optional 'pillow-heif' library, and file management. No obfuscation, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The use of sys.exit() in bulk mode may disrupt workflows but does not indicate malicious intent. External dependencies are handled responsibly. Overall, the script is a benign utility with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward image conversion utility supporting multiple formats, including HEIC/HEIF. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The minor usability concern regarding sys.exit() does not elevate the security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting a very low threat level.",
