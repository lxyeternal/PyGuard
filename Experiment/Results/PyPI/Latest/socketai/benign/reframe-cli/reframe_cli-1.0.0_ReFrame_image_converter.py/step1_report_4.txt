{
  "purpose": "The script converts images between formats, supporting batch processing, with special handling for HEIF/HEIC formats using pillow-heif.",
  "sources": "Input sources are image_path (file or directory), and environment-related modules like os and sys for file system and process control.",
  "sinks": "File system operations such as os.remove for deleting original images, cv2.imwrite for saving converted images, and potential system exit calls via sys.exit.",
  "flows": "Input data from image_path flows through file existence checks, format validation, image reading (via OpenCV or Pillow), and is then written out in the desired format. Original files are deleted if replaced.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.exit during bulk operations could abruptly terminate processes; no obvious hardcoded credentials or network operations; no obfuscated code features. The code relies on external libraries for HEIF/HEIC processing, but this is standard for image conversion.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image conversion functions with appropriate error handling for missing files, unsupported formats, and library dependencies. It conditionally deletes source files upon successful conversion if replacing the original. The use of pillow-heif for HEIF/HEIC formats is handled carefully with import checks. No suspicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The only potential concern is abrupt process termination with sys.exit during bulk conversions, which could be disruptive but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate image converter utility without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical image format conversion utility with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It handles multiple formats, includes error handling, and performs file operations securely. There are no indicators of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration.",
