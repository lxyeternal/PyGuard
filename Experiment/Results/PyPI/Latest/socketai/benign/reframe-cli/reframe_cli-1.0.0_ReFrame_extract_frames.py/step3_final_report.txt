  "purpose": "Extract frames from a video file within optional time ranges, saving as specified image format.",
  "sources": "Video file path, start_time, end_time, fps parameter, external utility create_output_dir",
  "sinks": "Saved image files in output directory",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation -> frame range calculation -> frame reading -> image saving",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; reliance on external create_output_dir utility, but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard video frame extraction using OpenCV, with proper validation and error handling. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present, no obfuscation, and no network activity. External utility create_output_dir appears benign. The scoring across reports aligns with the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk (~0.1-0.2). The logic is straightforward, and no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward utility for extracting video frames. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a safe and benign script.",
