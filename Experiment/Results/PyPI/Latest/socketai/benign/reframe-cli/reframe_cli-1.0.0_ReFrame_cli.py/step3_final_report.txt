  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for media processing functions: extracting frames from videos, converting images, and creating GIFs.",
  "sources": "User input paths and parameters via command line arguments",
  "sinks": "External functions receiving file paths and parameters; no direct untrusted data sinks within this code",
  "flows": "Command line arguments → routed to external media processing functions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface that routes user commands to imported functions from the ReFrame module. It does not perform any insecure operations, network activity, or code injection. The arguments are passed directly to external functions, which are assumed to be safe. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's structure is standard, and the absence of suspicious activity aligns with the assigned low malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI wrapper with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The external modules are assumed safe, and the code itself does not perform any risky operations.",
