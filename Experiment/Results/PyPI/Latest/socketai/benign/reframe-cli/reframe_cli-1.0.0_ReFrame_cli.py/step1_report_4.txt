  "purpose": "CLI tool for video and image manipulation tasks such as extracting frames, converting image formats, and creating GIFs.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments for file paths, formats, FPS, times, and durations.",
  "sinks": "File operations for reading and writing media files; subprocesses are not explicitly invoked; no network or data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "User provides input parameters which are passed directly to functions handling media files; no untrusted data flows into insecure functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; code appears standard and straightforward in purpose and structure.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily parses command-line arguments and calls functions to process media files. These functions are imported from external modules, which are not provided here; the code itself does not perform any unsafe operations or data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure is typical for CLI tools. All user inputs are passed directly to media processing functions without evident validation or sanitization issues, but this is typical for such scripts. No code injection, credential leaks, or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a media processing CLI wrapper, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It is standard in structure and purpose, with no signs of malware or supply chain attack vectors within this fragment.",
