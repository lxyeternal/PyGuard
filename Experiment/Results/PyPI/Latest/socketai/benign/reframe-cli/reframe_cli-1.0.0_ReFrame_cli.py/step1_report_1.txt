  "purpose": "CLI tool for video and image manipulation tasks such as extracting frames, converting image formats, and creating GIFs.",
  "sources": "Input arguments for video/image paths, command-line arguments for subcommands, user-supplied file and directory paths.",
  "sinks": "File writing functions in extract_frames, convert_image, create_gif; output files like images and GIFs.",
  "flows": "User input → argument parsing → function calls with user-provided paths and parameters → file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of user-supplied paths for file operations is standard for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily parses command-line arguments and routes calls to other modules responsible for media processing. No untrusted data is evaluated within this code; it relies on external modules. No network operations, reverse shells, or data exfiltration code are present. No obfuscation or malicious constructs identified. Usage of input/output paths is typical and controlled via user input.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper for media processing functions, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It safely delegates actual processing to imported modules. The code does not handle sensitive data directly nor does it contain suspicious behaviors.",
