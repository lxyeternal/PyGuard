  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for creating GIFs from images. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage are detected. The minimal security risk score is justified by filesystem operations and external utility reliance, but overall, it is very low. The code can be considered secure and benign."
