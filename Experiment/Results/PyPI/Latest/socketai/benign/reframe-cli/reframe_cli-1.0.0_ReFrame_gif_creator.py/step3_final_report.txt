  "purpose": "Create an animated GIF from a directory of images, stacking images sequentially.",
  "sources": "Image files in the specified directory (filtered by .png, .jpg, .jpeg), user input via command line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Output GIF file at specified path, filesystem directory creation, console print statements for errors and progress.",
  "flows": "Reads image files from directory -> converts images from BGR to RGB -> appends to list -> saves GIF to output path.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external utility function 'create_output_dir' without provided implementation; reliance on filesystem operations; no input sanitization beyond basic validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing and GIF creation with basic validation. It reads images, converts color space, and saves an animated GIF. No malicious network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The external utility 'create_output_dir' could pose a risk if compromised, but no evidence suggests malicious intent. Error handling is via print statements, which is typical for scripts but not secure in production. Overall, the code is benign, straightforward, and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for creating GIFs from images. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage are detected. The minimal security risk score is justified by filesystem operations and external utility reliance, but overall, it is very low. The code can be considered secure and benign.",
