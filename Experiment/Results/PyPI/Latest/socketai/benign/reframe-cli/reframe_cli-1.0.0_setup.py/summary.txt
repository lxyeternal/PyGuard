  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is an overestimation; given the benign nature, it should be 0. The overall assessment confirms the package is safe and free of malicious or suspicious elements."
