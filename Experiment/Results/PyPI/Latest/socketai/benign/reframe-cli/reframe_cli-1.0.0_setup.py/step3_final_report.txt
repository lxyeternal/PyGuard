  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'reframe-cli', defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' if exists; defines package info, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Initialization of package metadata and dependencies; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools, with conditional reading of a README file, package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point. It contains no dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted data. Dependencies are common image processing libraries. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code structure and content are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is an overestimation; given the benign nature, it should be 0. The overall assessment confirms the package is safe and free of malicious or suspicious elements.",
