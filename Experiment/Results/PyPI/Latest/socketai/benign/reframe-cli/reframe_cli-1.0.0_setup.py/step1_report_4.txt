{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'reframe-cli' Python package, configuring metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description, importing setuptools and os modules, and defining package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly sinks untrusted data or performs actions that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "N/A — the script is a standard package setup and does not process untrusted data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard setup procedures without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file if present, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points, all of which are standard. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or suspicious code paths are evident. The modules and dependencies listed are common and benign. The script does not execute any untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data beyond package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This is a normal, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices without obfuscated or malicious code.",
