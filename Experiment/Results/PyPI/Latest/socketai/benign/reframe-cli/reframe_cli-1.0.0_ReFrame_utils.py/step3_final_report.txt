  "purpose": "Create a directory at the specified output path if it does not already exist.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'output_dir' argument, checking if the path exists using os.path.exists.",

  "flows": "Input 'output_dir' -> os.path.exists check -> os.makedirs (if not exists) -> print/logging",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward directory creation with error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module, defines a function to create an output directory if it doesn't exist, with error handling via try-except. It checks for directory existence, creates it if missing, and logs the action. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or suspicious code are present. The code is simple, using standard library functions, and handles errors gracefully. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The logic is correct and secure within its scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for directory management with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
