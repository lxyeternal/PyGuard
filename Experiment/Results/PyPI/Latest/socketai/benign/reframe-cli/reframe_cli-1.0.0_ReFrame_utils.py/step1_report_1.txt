  "purpose": "Create a specified output directory if it does not already exist.",
  "sources": "User-provided output_dir argument, os.path.exists, os.makedirs",
  "sinks": "os.makedirs could create directories based on untrusted input; print outputs do not influence behavior",
  "flows": "Input argument output_dir -> os.path.exists / os.makedirs -> output directory creation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward directory management.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if a directory exists at the given path. If not, it attempts to create it using os.makedirs within a try-except block. Error handling prints an error message if creation fails. No untrusted data is processed beyond the input parameter. The use of print statements is standard for logging and does not pose security issues. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard directory creation code with proper error handling. There are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious data leaks, and no indication of sabotage or malware. The code appears safe and intentionally designed for directory management.",
