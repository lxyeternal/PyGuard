  "purpose": "Creates an output directory if it does not already exist.",
  "sources": "User-provided output_dir argument, checked with os.path.exists and used in os.makedirs.",
  "sinks": "os.path.exists, os.makedirs, print statements.",
  "flows": "Input argument 'output_dir' flows into os.path.exists and os.makedirs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard library functions properly and does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to create a directory if it does not exist, handling potential OSError exceptions. It uses standard os module functions and print statements for output. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications beyond directory creation. It is straightforward and typical for directory management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function for directory creation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
