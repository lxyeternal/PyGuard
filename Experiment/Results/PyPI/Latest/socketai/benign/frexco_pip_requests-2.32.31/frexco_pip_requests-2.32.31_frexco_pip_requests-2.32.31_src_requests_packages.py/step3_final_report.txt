  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by aliasing modules ('urllib3', 'idna', and optionally 'chardet') under the 'requests.packages' namespace.",
  "sources": "Imports of 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet' modules; reading sys.modules during aliasing.",
  "sinks": "sys.modules entries where modules are reassigned under 'requests.packages.*'.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are assigned to sys.modules entries, then these entries are reassigned under 'requests.packages.*'.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic manipulation of sys.modules for module aliasing; no hardcoded secrets or network activity; no malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and reassigns their sys.modules entries under a different namespace for legacy support. This pattern involves dynamic import and module aliasing, which is unusual but common in compatibility code. No malicious activity, secrets, or network operations are present. The manipulation of sys.modules could, in theory, be exploited if malicious modules are injected into the environment, but as-is, it is benign. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate, reflecting low risk but acknowledging potential misuse in compromised environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign backward compatibility pattern that manipulates sys.modules for legacy support. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified due to the potential for exploitation if the environment is compromised, but the code itself is safe.",
