  "purpose": "The code is a setup.py script for packaging a Python project, handling version checks, dependencies, and publishing commands.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__version__.py' via exec(); reads README.md; command-line arguments for publishing.",
  "sinks": "exec() executes code from version file; os.system() runs shell commands for packaging and uploading.",
  "flows": "exec() executes code from version file; os.system() runs packaging commands; command-line args trigger publish actions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses exec() on external version file without validation; open() calls with positional 'utf-8' instead of encoding parameter; potential runtime errors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks with common patterns. The use of exec() on a version file is a known risk if the file is compromised, but it is a typical pattern in setup scripts. The os.system() calls are controlled and standard for publishing. The open() calls with positional 'utf-8' are syntactically invalid in Python 3 and should specify encoding='utf-8'. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py script with minor security considerations related to exec() usage. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage is detected. The primary technical issue is the incorrect open() syntax, which is a bug but not security-related.",
