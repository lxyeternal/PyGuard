  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the technical details, potential risks, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** Standard setup.py operations, use of exec() on __version__.py, os.system calls for publishing.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — minor, due to exec() usage.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies exec() as a minor risk but finds no malicious intent. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the exec() and os.system usage.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity, just standard setup procedures.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — minor concern over exec().\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous, correctly notes that exec() could be risky if the version file is compromised but is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern, highlights exec() and os.system calls, potential risk if version file is malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.3 — slightly higher, but still just a minor concern.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The risk score is reasonable, given the exec() usage.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, mentions a typo in open() call (using 'utf-8' instead of 'encoding'), but not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity, just standard setup code with minor issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same general pattern, highlights exec() and os.system calls.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, consistent with others.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or malware.\n- **Use of exec():** While risky if the version file is compromised, this is a common pattern in setup scripts. The risk is minor and manageable if the version file is trusted.\n- **Shell commands via os.system:** Used for packaging and uploading, standard practice, no malicious activity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are appropriately set at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above 0 (0.2–0.3) due to exec() usage, which is reasonable.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minor, due to exec() pattern but not dangerous in context.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The setup.py script is standard, with a minor security consideration regarding exec(), but no actual malicious behavior or obfuscation present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a typical setup script with no malware.  \n- The scores are appropriate.  \n- The only concern is the use of exec() on external files, which is a known pattern but should be trusted in controlled environments.",
