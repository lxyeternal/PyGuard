{
  "purpose": "The code implements classes and functions for constructing, encoding, and handling HTTP requests and responses within the 'requests' library, including URL parsing, header validation, cookie management, data encoding, and response decoding.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as method, url, headers, data, files, json, params, cookies, and hooks; URL parsing functions; request data encoding functions; cookie extraction functions.",
  "sinks": "Request headers, body content, cookies, and response content; potential data leaks if untrusted input is mishandled, but no malicious sinks like network exfiltration or system modification are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> encoding and validation functions -> request object attributes -> response content decoding and error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no network connections to suspicious domains.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an HTTP client, handling URL parsing, request preparation, header validation, data encoding, cookie management, and response processing. It uses common libraries and patterns, with appropriate error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are evident. The data flows are typical for such a library, and no suspicious sinks or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured part of the 'requests' library, with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the standard nature of the implementation.",
