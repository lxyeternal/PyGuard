{
  "purpose": "This code provides the default CA certificate bundle location for SSL/TLS verification, primarily for use in the Requests library or similar applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'certifi' package via the 'where' function to obtain the path to the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "The path returned by 'where()' is printed to standard output when executed as a script.",
  "flows": "Input: The 'where()' function from 'certifi' reads the CA bundle location; Output: The path is printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward, using a well-known library to retrieve and display a CA bundle path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' to determine the path to the CA bundle used for SSL verification. When executed directly, it prints this path. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data manipulation, and no network activity or data exfiltration. The code serves a simple utility purpose with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning solely to display the location of the CA bundle provided by 'certifi'. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
