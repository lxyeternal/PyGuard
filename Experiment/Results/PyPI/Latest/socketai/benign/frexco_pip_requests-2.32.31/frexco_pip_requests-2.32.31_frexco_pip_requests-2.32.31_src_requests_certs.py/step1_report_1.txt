{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'where' function imported from the certifi package.",
  "sinks": "The output of the 'where' function is printed to stdout.",
  "flows": "The code calls 'where()' and prints its return value; no untrusted input is involved, so no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code simply imports a library and prints a function output without additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal, importing 'where' from 'certifi' to output the path to the CA bundle. It has no input processing, no data manipulation, and no suspicious code behavior. The code is straightforward and serves a diagnostic or informational purpose. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that outputs the default CA bundle location provided by the 'certifi' package. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
