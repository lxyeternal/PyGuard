  "purpose": "Provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing the 'where' function from the certifi package.",
  "targets": "The print statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' -> call 'where()' -> print the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and only outputs a file path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, which returns the path to the trusted CA certificates bundle. When executed directly, it prints this path. The code is simple, well-structured, and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not read untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or access external systems beyond the certifi package. There are no hardcoded secrets or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves to output the standard CA bundle location. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
