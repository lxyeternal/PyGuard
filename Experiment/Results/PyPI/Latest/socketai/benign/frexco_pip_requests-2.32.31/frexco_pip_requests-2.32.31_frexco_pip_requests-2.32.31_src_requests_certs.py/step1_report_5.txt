  "purpose": "This module provides the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to standard output using print(), which could be seen as a way to expose the CA bundle location.",
  "flows": "Input: The 'where' function retrieves the CA bundle path; Output: The print() outputs this path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from certifi, then prints the CA bundle location when executed directly. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated elements, or malicious behavior. The code simply exposes a known path used for SSL verification, which is common in Python requests handling. No data leaks, injection vulnerabilities, or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to display the default CA bundle path from certifi, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
