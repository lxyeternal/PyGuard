{
  "purpose": "This script provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests library, primarily for verifying SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The script prints the result of 'where()' to standard output.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function provides the certificate bundle path, which is printed if the script is executed directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code is straightforward and standard for its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi', a standard and widely used package for SSL certificates. It simply prints the path to the CA bundle when run as a main program. There are no external data sources or untrusted inputs, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The code's structure is simple, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. It appears to serve a utility purpose without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script to output the default CA bundle location used by 'requests'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as intended without any security concerns.",
