  "purpose": "Outputs the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' and the __main__ block printing its value.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' -> print(where()) in main block.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known function from a trusted package and prints its output when executed directly. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The logic is simple and static, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no security risks or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that outputs the path to the certifi CA bundle. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
