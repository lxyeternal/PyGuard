  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'frexco-pip-requests' Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements for package metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "None; only static assignment of metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be straightforward metadata definitions with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only variable assignments for package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, and license. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing. The metadata includes a URL pointing to a GitHub repository but no code that performs network requests or other operations. The code appears to be a typical __init__.py or setup file with no malicious constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package metadata declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
