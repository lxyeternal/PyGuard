  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'frexco-pip-requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and other related information.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments for metadata fields; no input or data reading functions present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to critical functions or data leaks; only static data assignments observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward package metadata without obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments defining package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright. There are no functions, external data sources, user inputs, or dynamic operations. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as network communication, file manipulation, or data exfiltration, is present. The code's structure and content are typical for Python package setup or metadata files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign, standard declaration of package information.",
