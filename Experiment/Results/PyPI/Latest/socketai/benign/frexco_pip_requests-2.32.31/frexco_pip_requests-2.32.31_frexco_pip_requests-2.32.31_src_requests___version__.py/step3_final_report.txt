  "purpose": "Define package metadata including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and decorative ASCII art.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments for package information; no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static metadata only.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art comments; no suspicious or obfuscated code; purely static metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. ASCII art comments are decorative and do not influence behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is straightforward and benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1 in these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package metadata declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
