{
  "purpose": "Defines various exception classes for handling different error scenarios in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and local .compat module; exception instantiations and attribute access within class constructors.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink points where untrusted data directly affects system security or leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised and handled internally; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of exception classes for the Requests library, including proper inheritance and constructors. No malicious logic, data leaks, or backdoors are evident. The code primarily defines error classes and warnings, with no external data processing or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of exception class definitions for error handling in a Python HTTP request library. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks in this fragment.",
