  "purpose": "Define and handle exceptions for the Requests library, including error types, warnings, and related functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external exceptions (urllib3.exceptions, .compat.JSONDecodeError); class initializers and methods within the module.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data is processed or transmitted within the code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is primarily class definitions and initializers without data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code strictly defines exception classes and warnings without any external data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of exception classes for the Requests library, including custom error types and warnings. It imports external exception classes and defines subclasses for specific request errors, as well as some warning classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code activity. No external inputs, sensitive data handling, or network operations occur within this module.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as a structured exception and warning definition for the Requests library, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
