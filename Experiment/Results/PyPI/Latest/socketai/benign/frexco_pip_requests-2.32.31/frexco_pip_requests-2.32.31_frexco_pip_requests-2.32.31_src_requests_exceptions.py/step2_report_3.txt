  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n\n- The code is a set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, including various HTTP errors, connection issues, timeouts, URL validation errors, and warnings.\n- It imports exceptions from `urllib3.exceptions` and a local `.compat` module.\n- The classes are standard, with proper inheritance, constructors, and methods like `__reduce__` for pickling support.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs here.\n- The code is well-structured, straightforward, and adheres to typical Python exception class patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n**Security & Malware Assessment:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious code or backdoors:** No evidence.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None; the code is purely class definitions for error handling.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware or malicious intent:** None; the code is standard exception hierarchy.\n- **Data leaks or external data processing:** No, as this is a static exception module.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior or code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Consistency with Reports:**\n\nAll reports agree that this code is a standard, benign implementation of exception classes with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling. It imports external exceptions but does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious patterns. The detailed analysis confirms no malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and contains no security risks or malware. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
