  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the described logic, the code, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is utility functions for cookie handling, with no suspicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, confidence is 1.0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a well-known cookie utility module, with standard classes and functions. No network activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious logic.\n\n- **Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate. The malware score is correctly 0, as there's no malicious behavior. Security risk is minimal, given the benign purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, emphasizing standard cookie handling, no external connections, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent. Malware score is 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions like `create_cookie`, `merge_cookies`, and cookie extraction are standard. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n- **Verdict:** The malware score of 0 is justified. The security risk is low; the code is utility-focused.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is standard cookie management, with no suspicious activity. Malware score 0, security risk 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code handles cookie creation, extraction, and management, with no external network activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Verdict:** The malware score is correct. The security risk is very low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing standard cookie utilities, no malicious logic, obfuscation, or network activity. Malware score 0, security risk 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical cookie utility module, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard cookie management code, no malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. Malware score 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely for cookie handling, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's functionality—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code being straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, given the code's utility nature and absence of network or system modifications.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-understood utility module for cookie handling in the requests library.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.\n- The scores assigned across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's purpose and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent to cookie handling, but no vulnerabilities or malicious risks identified)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the code's nature.",
