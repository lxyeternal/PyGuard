  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for managing cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, header management, and cookie jar manipulation.",
  "sources": "Reading request headers, URL parsing, cookie attributes (e.g., 'max-age', 'expires'), and response headers.",
  "sinks": "Cookie header generation, cookie storage, and removal functions; no external network or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input data from request headers and cookie attributes flow into cookie creation and extraction functions; cookies are stored and retrieved via the cookie jar.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. Use of threading lock and pickle support are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard, well-documented utilities for cookie handling, including mock request/response wrappers, cookie creation, extraction, and management functions. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The functions operate on data structures and headers in a predictable manner, consistent with open-source cookie management practices. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident. The code is designed for compatibility and robustness, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for cookie management within the requests library. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The data flows are limited to cookie creation, extraction, and header management, with no network activity or system modifications. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is effectively zero.",
