  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign utility module for cookie handling, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough; no suspicious patterns or malicious intent detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully consistent, no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code facilitates cookie handling with no evidence of malicious behavior; standard procedures are used.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score is slightly above zero, reflecting minimal risk associated with cookie handling (e.g., potential for injection if untrusted data is mishandled). Since the code does not process untrusted data insecurely, this is conservative but acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; standard cookie management with no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower securityRisk score, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard cookie utility functions, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low securityRisk score aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Cookie management utilities with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk, possibly due to the general nature of cookie handling, but no evidence of misuse.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate a 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in some reports, reflecting minimal inherent risk in cookie handling, which is standard and acceptable.\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, well-structured utility module for cookie management, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The scores are appropriately conservative.**\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal inherent risk in cookie handling, consistent with the reports.\n\n**This aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.**",
