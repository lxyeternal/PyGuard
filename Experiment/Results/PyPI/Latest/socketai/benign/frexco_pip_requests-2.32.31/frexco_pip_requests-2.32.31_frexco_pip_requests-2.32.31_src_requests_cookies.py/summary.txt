  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for cookie management within the requests library. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The data flows are limited to cookie creation, extraction, and header management, with no network activity or system modifications. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is effectively zero."
