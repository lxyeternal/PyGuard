{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities and cookie management classes/functions for the `requests` library, facilitating cookie handling, cookie extraction, and cookie jar operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal utils (`to_native_string`), standard modules (`calendar`, `copy`, `time`, `threading/dummy_threading`), and the local compatibility modules (`Morsel`, `MutableMapping`, `cookielib`, `urlparse`, `urlunparse`).",
  "sinks": "Methods that set, update, or delete cookies (`set`, `set_cookie`, `remove_cookie_by_name`, `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, `update`, etc.) and the `extract_cookies_to_jar` which extracts cookies from responses.",
  "flows": "Input sources are request objects, response headers, or dictionaries of cookies. Cookies are created or updated via methods like `create_cookie`, `set`, or `cookiejar_from_dict`. Extracted cookies flow into the jar via `extract_cookies_to_jar`. Cookies are sent via `get_cookie_header`. Modifications can happen through setters or deletions, with flows from external data into the jar.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily implements standard cookie handling and compatibility layers; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. Usage of `cookiejar` and cookie management functions appears standard and safe. No obfuscated code, no external network connections, or data exfiltration points identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides mechanisms to wrap request and response objects, extract cookies, produce cookie headers, and manage cookie jars with dict-like interfaces. Functions like `create_cookie`, `cookiejar_from_dict`, and `merge_cookies` are standard cookie utility functions. No evidence of malicious logic, network activity, or privacy violations. The code adheres to expected cookie handling patterns and compatibility interfaces, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and intended solely for cookie management within the requests ecosystem. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It facilitates cookie handling without compromising security or privacy.",
