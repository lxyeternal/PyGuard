  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided and cross-referencing with the code.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard compatibility and utility module, primarily importing standard libraries, handling optional dependencies, and detecting versions.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- The use of importlib for dynamic module loading is typical and safe.\n- No untrusted data processing, network activity, or sensitive operations are present.\n- The code appears to be well-structured for its purpose, with exception handling and fallbacks.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- Purpose: Compatibility and utility functions.\n- Findings: No suspicious code; dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' is safe.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. The report correctly assesses the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Purpose: Compatibility utilities for Python 2/3, dependency management.\n- Findings: No untrusted data processing; standard version detection and optional imports.\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. The code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Purpose: Compatibility functions and dependency imports.\n- Findings: No data processing or suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid. The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Purpose: Compatibility and utility modules.\n- Findings: No untrusted data or suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Standard compatibility code.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Purpose: Compatibility and library detection.\n- Findings: No data leaks, suspicious activity, or obfuscation.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the analysis, a risk score of **0** is appropriate for all.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The dynamic imports are standard practice for optional dependencies.\n- Version detection and compatibility handling are common and safe.\n- No untrusted data flows or network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n**Based on the detailed review, I recommend the following scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign compatibility utility module with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:** The reports are accurate. The code is safe, and no changes to the scores are necessary.",
