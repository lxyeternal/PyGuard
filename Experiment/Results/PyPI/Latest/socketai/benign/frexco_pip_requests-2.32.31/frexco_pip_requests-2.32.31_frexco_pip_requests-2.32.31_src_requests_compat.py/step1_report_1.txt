{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling HTTP requests and character detection across different Python versions and libraries.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module for 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', sys.version_info for Python version, urllib3.__version__, standard library modules (json, collections, http, io, urllib).",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module potentially loads external modules, but only internally used; no data sinks for untrusted data identified.",
  "flows": "importlib.import_module for chardet or charset_normalizer -> assignment to chardet; version detection via sys.version_info -> control flow; standard library imports and assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors present; code is purely compatibility and utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports standard libraries and manages compatibility issues across Python versions. The dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' is a common pattern for flexibility but does not involve untrusted data. Version detection is straightforward. No obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The use of importlib for dynamic module loading is standard and safe in this context. Overall, the code appears to serve utility purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a compatibility and utility module that handles environment-specific imports and settings. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security issues.",
