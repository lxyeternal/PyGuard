{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility handling for Python 2 and 3, manages optional dependencies like chardet and simplejson, and detects library versions to ensure smooth operation across environments.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, optional modules (importlib, sys, urllib3, chardet, simplejson), and version detection variables.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks. It only performs environment detection and module imports.",
  "flows": "The code flows from environment detection (sys.version_info, urllib3.__version__) to optional module resolution (importlib.import_module), with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard patterns for compatibility and optional dependency handling. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility layer, importing standard modules, handling optional dependencies safely, and detecting environment versions. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code beyond safe importlib calls. The dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' is a common pattern, and version detection is simple and reliable. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for environment compatibility. It contains no malicious logic, no obfuscation, and poses no security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
