  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the underlying code for potential security issues, anomalies, or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code primarily performs environment detection, optional module imports, and compatibility adjustments.\n- No untrusted data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution beyond standard importlib usage.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The import patterns are standard for compatibility layers.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign and purely utility-focused.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n- **Presence of reported code:** All reports correctly identify the code as the compatibility and utility module described.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None detected; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could be exploited.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' is safe and common.\n- Version detection via `sys.version_info` and `urllib3.__version__` is straightforward.\n- Importing modules with try-except blocks for optional dependencies is standard practice.\n- No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very low, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- Given the analysis, I agree with the provided scores; no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final justification:\n\n- The code is a standard compatibility layer.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.\n- No suspicious behaviors or code patterns.\n- The dynamic imports are controlled and safe.\n- The version detection and import resolution are straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Justification |\n|------------------|---------------|\n| **Malware**     | 0 — No malicious activity or code. |\n| **Obfuscated**  | 0 — Clear, straightforward code. |\n| **Risk**        | 0 — No security risk; static imports and compatibility logic only. |\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign, standard compatibility and utility module for handling Python version differences and optional dependencies. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The reports are accurate, and I concur with their assessments.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No further action needed; the code is safe and well-understood.",
