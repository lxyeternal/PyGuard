  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as managing dependencies like urllib3, chardet, and simplejson.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries and third-party modules (importlib, sys, urllib3, chardet, simplejson, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request).",
  "sinks": "No sink points are present that process untrusted input; the code only imports modules and assigns variables.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and assigns them to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and standard for compatibility management.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily focused on module imports, version detection, and compatibility adjustments between Python 2 and 3. It includes version parsing, optional import attempts (simplejson, chardet), and aliasing functions and types for compatibility. There are no functions or logic that process external input or perform operations that could be exploited. The code does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. Overall, it appears to be standard, well-understood compatibility code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only manages imports and version checks for compatibility purposes.",
