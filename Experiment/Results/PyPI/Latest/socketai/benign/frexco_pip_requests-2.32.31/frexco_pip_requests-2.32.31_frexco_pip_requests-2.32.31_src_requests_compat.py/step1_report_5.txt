{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling different Python versions and HTTP-related operations, ensuring backward compatibility and dynamic library detection.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as importlib, sys, urllib3, and optional libraries like chardet, simplejson, and standard collections modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data directly or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, detecting library versions, and defining utility functions for compatibility; there are no data flow paths involving untrusted input to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs dynamic imports and version checks but does not handle or process sensitive data; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily concerned with module imports, version detection, and compatibility utilities. It uses try-except blocks for optional dependencies and dynamic imports for modules like chardet and simplejson. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor are there any suspicious function calls or network interactions. The logic is standard for compatibility layers, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical compatibility utility module with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions to facilitate support across Python versions and dependencies without handling sensitive data or executing untrusted operations.",
