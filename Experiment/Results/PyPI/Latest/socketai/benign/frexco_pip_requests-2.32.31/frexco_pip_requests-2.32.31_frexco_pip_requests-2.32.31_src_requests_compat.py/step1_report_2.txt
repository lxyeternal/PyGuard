{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility utilities for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and manages imports for various Python standard libraries and third-party packages.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from sys, attempts to import optional modules like 'chardet', 'simplejson', and various standard library modules via importlib, import statements, and package version strings.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input data; the code primarily performs static imports, version checks, and module resolution.",
  "flows": "The code reads version info and module import success status (source), then sets flags or variables accordingly. It does not process or execute untrusted data that could flow into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code are present. The code performs standard compatibility handling, optional imports, and version checks without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code handles backward compatibility with Python 2 and 3, performs version detection for urllib3, resolves optional modules ('chardet', 'simplejson'), and imports various standard modules. All actions are typical for compatibility layers, with no signs of malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with proper exception handling for optional imports, and no dynamic code execution beyond standard importlib usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and import management module with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely performs static module imports, version checks, and compatibility flag settings.",
