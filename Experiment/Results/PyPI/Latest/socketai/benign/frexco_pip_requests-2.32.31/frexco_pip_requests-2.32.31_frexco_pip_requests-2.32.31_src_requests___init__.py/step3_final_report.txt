  "purpose": "Dependency verification, environment compatibility checks, and SSL fallback setup within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Version strings from urllib3, chardet, charset_normalizer; environment and import checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; mainly version assertions and warnings.",
  "flows": "Version info read during import; assertions and warnings for environment validation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for version checks (which can be disabled), reliance on warnings instead of exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency and environment validation, including version checks for urllib3, chardet, charset_normalizer, and cryptography. It uses assertions for version validation, which could be bypassed if Python is run with optimizations, but this is common in setup scripts. Warnings are used for non-critical issues. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. The SSL fallback mechanism and dependency warnings are routine for ensuring compatibility. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup routine for the requests library, performing dependency checks and environment configuration without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are justified and accurate.",
