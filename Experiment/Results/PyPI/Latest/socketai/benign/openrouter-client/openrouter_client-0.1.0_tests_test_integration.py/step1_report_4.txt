{
  "purpose": "The code performs integration testing for the openrouter client library, making real API calls to test chat completion and streaming responses.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (settings.OPENROUTER_API_KEY, settings.OPENROUTER_API_TEST_MODEL), input prompts, and response streams.",
  "sinks": "API request functions, response handling, printing output, and parsing streaming response chunks.",
  "flows": "API key retrieval -> API request construction -> API call -> response validation and printing. Streaming response chunks are read, decoded, and aggregated.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious hardcoded credentials or secret keys. The only environment-dependent data is API keys and model names. The streaming chunk handling includes some redundant type checks and unsafe exception suppression with a broad except clause.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard for integration testing with external API calls. It reads API keys and model info from settings, constructs requests, and processes responses. The streaming response handler processes chunks with basic type checks and exception suppression but no malicious code or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. Use of print statements is benign for test output. No data leaks or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate testing of API interactions without malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious code patterns are identified. The code's purpose is to verify functionality, not to exfiltrate data or harm systems.",
