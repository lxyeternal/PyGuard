  "purpose": "Load environment variables from .env files and define application settings with default values.",
  "sources": "Reading from .env files in specified paths; environment variables loaded by load_dotenv.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; environment variables are stored in memory for application use.",
  "flows": "File existence check -> load_dotenv -> populate Settings instance with environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of default placeholder API key 'your_openrouter_api_key' which could be insecure if not overridden. No hardcoded secrets found in the code itself.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to load environment variables from multiple locations, which is standard practice. The Settings class defines configuration parameters, including a placeholder API key, which should be replaced in production. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious actions. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. Overall, it appears to be a benign configuration setup for an application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration loader with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The only concern is the default placeholder for the API key, which should be replaced securely in production environments. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
