{
  "purpose": "Load environment variables from multiple .env files and define configuration settings for the application using pydantic.",
  "sources": "Reading from .env files in specified paths; environment variables loaded via load_dotenv().",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted in a vulnerable manner.",
  "flows": "Environment files are checked for existence; first found is loaded into environment variables; settings class accesses these variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of default placeholder API key ('your_openrouter_api_key') which should be replaced in production; no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard environment configuration loading with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious logic. The only concern is the placeholder API key, which is a common practice in sample code but should be replaced before deployment. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration loader with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is replacing the placeholder API key in production. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
