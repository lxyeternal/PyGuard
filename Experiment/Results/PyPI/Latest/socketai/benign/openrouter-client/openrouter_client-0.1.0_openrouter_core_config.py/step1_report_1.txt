  "purpose": "Load environment variables from specific .env files and define application settings related to OpenRouter API configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading from filesystem to check existence of .env files; load_dotenv() loads environment variables from the first existing file.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables stored in the environment, accessible via os.environ; no direct use of untrusted input beyond file existence checks.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check for .env files -> load_dotenv() loads variables into environment -> Settings class reads environment variables during instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. Defaults for API key are hardcoded, but this is common in config files; no evidence of hardcoded secrets in active use.",
  "analysis": "The script searches for predefined environment files and loads the first found. The Settings class uses Pydantic to define configuration defaults, which can be overridden by environment variables. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no malicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard environment setup for an application, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The only concern might be the default placeholder API key, which should be replaced in production but is not malicious.",
