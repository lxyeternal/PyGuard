{
  "purpose": "Load environment variables from multiple possible .env files and define configuration settings for API interaction",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables from .env files using load_dotenv",
  "sinks": "None of the data directly flow into dangerous sinks such as system commands or network transmissions",
  "flows": "Environment files are loaded at startup, and configuration variables are set from these sources; no further data flow to sinks is observed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets other than default placeholder values; the code loads multiple env files for flexibility but does not process untrusted input; no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors present",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to load environment variables from several specified files, which is typical for configuration management. It uses dotenv to load environment variables if these files exist. The configuration class uses pydantic to define settings with default values, including placeholders for API keys. There is no evidence of malicious code, such as network exfiltration, command execution, or data theft. The code appears to be designed solely for configuration setup, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration loader with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It simply manages environment variable loading and configuration defaults. The use of placeholder API keys is standard in sample code, with no evidence of secret leaks or malicious intent.",
