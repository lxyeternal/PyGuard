{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for OpenRouter API requests, including validation rules for inputs.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes, including local helpers; receives input data via class instances.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code does not write data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated and stored in class instances; no data flows to external systems or insecure outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed. The validation logic appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of Pydantic models with validation logic to enforce input constraints and mutually exclusive parameters. No untrusted data sources, data leakage mechanisms, or code execution vulnerabilities are evident. The only validation involves ensuring 'messages' and 'prompt' are not both provided and that at least one is present, which is standard input validation. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical data validation layer for API request modeling without malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured with no signs of malicious behavior or malware.",
