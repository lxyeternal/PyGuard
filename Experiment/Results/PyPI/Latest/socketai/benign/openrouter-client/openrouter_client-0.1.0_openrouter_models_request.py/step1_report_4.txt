  "purpose": "Define data models for constructing requests to the OpenRouter API, including validation logic for request parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for the ChatCompletionRequest model, particularly 'messages', 'prompt', and other configuration fields.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; code does not write or transmit data, only defines data structures and validation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and stored in the model; no untrusted data is directly used in any sensitive operation within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The validation logic ensures mutually exclusive 'messages' and 'prompt', and checks for required inputs. No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Pydantic models for API requests, with appropriate validation for mutually exclusive fields and required inputs. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The code relies on standard validation methods and imports. No external network connections or data exfiltration activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard, well-structured data model with validation for API request parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is safe and does not contain malware.",
