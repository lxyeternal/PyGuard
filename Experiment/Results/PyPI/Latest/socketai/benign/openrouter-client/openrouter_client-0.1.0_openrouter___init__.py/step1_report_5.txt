{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific functions and classes from a local 'client' module, and defines metadata variables such as version, author, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module and the local 'client' module, and uses import statements to access functions/classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this code snippet; no data is written to external systems, network, or files.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable within this snippet, as it only involves imports and metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present. The metadata contains a future copyright year, which might be a typo, but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from a relative module, which is standard practice. It sets module metadata variables. There are no dynamic executions, network connections, or data handling that could be malicious. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident. The only unusual aspect is the copyright year '2025', which is in the future, possibly a typo or placeholder but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code functions as a simple module with metadata and imports, with no suspicious or harmful operations.",
