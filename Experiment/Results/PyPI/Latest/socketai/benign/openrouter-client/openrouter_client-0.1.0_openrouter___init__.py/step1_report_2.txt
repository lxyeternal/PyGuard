{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific functions and classes from a local 'client' module, and defines metadata such as version, author, license, and copyright information.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata strings (__version__, __author__, __license__, __copyright__) and imports from a local module ('client').",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data output points; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only defines metadata and performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets (beyond metadata), or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports symbols from a local module and sets module-level metadata. No data input or external communication is present. The import statement does not suggest malicious intent, and the metadata fields are standard. The copyright date appears to be 2025, which is in the future and might be a typo, but does not indicate malicious behavior. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as part of a package's module with standard metadata and imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
