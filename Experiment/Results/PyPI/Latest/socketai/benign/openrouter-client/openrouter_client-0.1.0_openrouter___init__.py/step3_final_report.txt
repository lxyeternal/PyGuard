{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package's initialization or metadata module, importing specific functions from a local 'client' module and defining static metadata variables such as version, author, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from '.client' module; assignment of metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __license__, __copyright__)",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network communication, or untrusted input handling present",
  "flows": "Import statements and metadata assignments are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting solely of static imports and metadata definitions. There are no dynamic behaviors, external communications, or data processing. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, which does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and static nature imply no security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.",
