  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, consisting of static metadata definitions and imports from a local module.\n- No evidence of data processing, external communication, or dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports. No malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as expected, since the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** 0, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying that this code is benign.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate given the content.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the analysis is based solely on the visible code.\n- The future copyright year is noted as unusual but not malicious, which is a reasonable conclusion.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard package initialization or metadata module.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and reasonable.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- I agree with the current scores.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, with no security concerns.",
