{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module metadata and import specific components from a local client module, likely setting up the package's API and versioning information.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __license__, __copyright__) and imports functions and classes from a relative module named .client.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain obvious sinks related to untrusted data or malicious behavior such as network connections, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident, as the code only initializes variables and imports modules without processing input or executing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets (besides static metadata), or suspicious constructs are present. The __copyright__ date is in the future (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets module metadata and imports from a local module. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity. The presence of standard metadata and imports suggests typical package setup. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard package metadata and import code with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a Python project setup.",
