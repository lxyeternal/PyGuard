  "malware": 0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "purpose": "A FastAPI proxy server for OpenRouter chat completions, handling both streaming and non-streaming responses with validation and error handling.",
  "sources": "Configuration settings, incoming request payloads, response lines from httpx.Response during streaming.",
  "sinks": "Relayed response data to clients, potential for data exposure if external API is compromised, but no malicious intent detected.",
  "flows": "Request payload -> OpenRouter API endpoint -> response processing -> streaming or direct response -> client.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for debugging; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious external connections; straightforward code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a standard API proxy, validating responses with Pydantic models, handling streaming via a line-by-line async generator, and managing errors appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. API keys are loaded from environment/configuration, and response relaying is typical for such proxies. The overall design is secure and transparent, with high confidence in benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured FastAPI proxy for OpenRouter, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The current scores accurately reflect its benign nature and minimal security concerns.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
