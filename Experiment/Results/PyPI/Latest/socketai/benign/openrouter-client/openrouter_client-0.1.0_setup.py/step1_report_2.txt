  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the openrouter-client Python package, including package discovery, metadata, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, retrieves package info via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup process is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and find packages. It reads a local README.md file for description and specifies classifiers and requirements. All code appears standard for a setup.py configuration without any dynamic or malicious behavior. No user input, network activity, or external data sources are involved. The code structure is typical and straightforward for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for Python package distribution.",
