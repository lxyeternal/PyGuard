  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the openrouter-client Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading the local 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' (source) during setup() call (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata, discover packages, and read a local README file. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscated patterns. The reading of 'README.md' is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 or 0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The code poses negligible security risk, and the minimal risk score accounts for reading a file, which is common in setup scripts. No evidence of supply chain attacks, backdoors, or malicious intent is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are consistent with its benign nature. No further action is necessary.",
