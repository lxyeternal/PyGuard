  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content and passing it to 'long_description' parameter during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read a local file is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It includes package metadata, versioning, author info, description, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirements. The only notable operation is reading 'README.md' for the long description, which is a common practice. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behavior is evident. The structure and content appear typical for a package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate and conventional setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
