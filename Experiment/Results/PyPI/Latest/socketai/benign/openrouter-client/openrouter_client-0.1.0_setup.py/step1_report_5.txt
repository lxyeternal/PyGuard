  "flows": "The only data flow is from the static README.md file into the long_description parameter during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with static parameters including package info, author details, description, URL, classifiers, and license. It reads 'README.md' content for long_description. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.",
