  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' -> long_description in setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read a file directly without validation; no apparent malicious behavior, but could be unsafe if the file contents are malicious or manipulated externally",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration script for packaging a Python project. It imports 'setuptools', uses 'find_packages' to include specific packages, and reads a README file for long description. There are no hardcoded secrets, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The file read operation is straightforward and typical for setup scripts. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or malware indicators are observed. It follows standard packaging practices without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup configuration script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
