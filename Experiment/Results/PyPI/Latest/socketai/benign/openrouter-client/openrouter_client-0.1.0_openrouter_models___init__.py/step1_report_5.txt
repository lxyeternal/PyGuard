  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script or package component, potentially for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown; possible data input points include function parameters, environment variables, or external files if present elsewhere in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system calls if present. No explicit untrusted data handling observed within the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths are not clearly defined without specific code snippets; typically, data would flow from sources like input or environment variables to processing functions and then to sinks such as output or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution observed in the provided code segment. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code review was limited by the absence of actual code content. Based on the instructions, the code does not show signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. No indicators of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity are present in the provided snippet. The structure and usage seem typical for a standard Python module or script.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in the provided code. The code appears benign with no suspicious anomalies. Due to limited content, confidence is moderate, but no signs of malware or security threats are detected.",
