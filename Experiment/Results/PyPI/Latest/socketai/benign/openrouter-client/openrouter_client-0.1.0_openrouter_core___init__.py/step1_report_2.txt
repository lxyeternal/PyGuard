  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python script or module, but there is no visible code provided in the prompt to determine its exact function.",
  "sources": "The code would typically read input from user input, environment variables, files, or network sources; however, no specific sources are visible in the provided content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution calls, but again, no specific sinks are visible in the provided content.",
  "flows": "Without actual code, it's impossible to trace source-to-sink flows; no code means no data flow paths are identifiable.",
  "anomalies": "There are no visible anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns due to lack of code content.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited by the absence of code. Based on the instructions, no suspicious or malicious patterns can be detected without code. No sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies are identifiable. Therefore, no malicious or security issues can be determined from the provided information.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for review, making it impossible to identify malicious behavior or security risks. The assessment indicates no evidence of malware or security concerns based on the current input.",
