  "conclusion": "The provided reports are generally consistent and appropriately scored based on their descriptions. No significant inconsistencies are identified. The most suspicious report (Report 4) warrants a slightly lower malware score to reflect uncertainty. Overall, the dependency appears low risk with minor concerns related to obfuscation and dynamic features. Further dynamic analysis is recommended if code snippets are available to confirm malicious activity."
