  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured set of data models for an API, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), primarily due to untrusted input handling potential but not inherent in the code itself."
