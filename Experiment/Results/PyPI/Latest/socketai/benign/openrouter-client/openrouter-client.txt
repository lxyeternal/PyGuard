      "conclusion": "The provided reports are generally consistent and appropriately scored based on their descriptions. No significant inconsistencies are identified. The most suspicious report (Report 4) warrants a slightly lower malware score to reflect uncertainty. Overall, the dependency appears low risk with minor concerns related to obfuscation and dynamic features. Further dynamic analysis is recommended if code snippets are available to confirm malicious activity."

The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), primarily due to untrusted input handling potential but not inherent in the code itself."

The existing scores are justified, with a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) due to external API interactions but no malicious activity."
