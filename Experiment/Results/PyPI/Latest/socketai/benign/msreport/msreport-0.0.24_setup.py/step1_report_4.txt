  "purpose": "To set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script simply calls the setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for a setup script; no anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setuptools' module and calls its 'setup()' function without any arguments. This is a common pattern for Python package setup files (setup.py). No user input, environment variables, or external data is used. The code contains no obfuscated logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The minimal nature of this script reduces the likelihood of malicious intent or malicious code inclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard minimal setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
