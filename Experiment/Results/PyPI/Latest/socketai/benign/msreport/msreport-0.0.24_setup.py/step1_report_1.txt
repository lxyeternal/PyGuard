  "purpose": "Setup script for Python package distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'setup' function from setuptools, which is a standard way to define package metadata and configuration.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or execute any operations that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The code imports a function and then calls it directly; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The script is minimal and standard; no unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "This is a basic setup script that imports and calls setuptools.setup() with default parameters. It contains no user input, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The code is typical for Python package distribution and poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It functions solely to facilitate package installation and distribution without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
