  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for Python packaging using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import of 'setup' from 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply calls setup() with no arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard code with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic, standard Python setup script that imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and executes it. It contains no user input, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no data handling. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, reflecting the absence of malicious or risky behavior. The confidence score is 1, given the simplicity and standard pattern of the code. No issues or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Python setup script with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports and scores are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
