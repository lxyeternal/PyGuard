  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks; the setup() function is a standard call with no arguments.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors present in this minimal script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from the setuptools library and calls it with default parameters. It is a typical minimal setup script used for packaging. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The simplicity and standard nature of this script indicate no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is used to prepare a Python package for distribution. No suspicious activity is present.",
