  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides visualization functions based on data from a `Qtable` object, with no untrusted input handling beyond data access.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Generates plots; no external data transmission or file writes. Data flows from internal data structures to visualization.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic execution. Uses standard libraries.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard for scientific visualization, with no signs of malicious activity. The automatic log-space detection is typical in proteomics workflows.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (low, mainly because of potential data handling concerns but no actual risk).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing data visualization routines for proteomics data, with no external communication or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (very low).\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; the code is safe and purely analytical.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, a set of visualization functions relying on data from `Qtable`. No external data transmission or execution.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid; no malicious signals.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar conclusion: functions for visualization, no network, no file writes, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.05 (very low).\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; safe code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: data visualization routines, no external communication, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports agree that the code is purely for data visualization and analysis.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are very low, consistent with the absence of security issues.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.05–0.1 (very low, primarily due to potential data handling concerns but no actual risk)\n\n### Critical Reflection:\n- The automatic log-space detection and transformation are standard in proteomics workflows, not malicious.\n- The code does not perform any network communication, file writing beyond returning figures, or code execution.\n- The data flow is internal and controlled, with no user input being executed as code.\n- The libraries used are standard and well-understood.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a safe, standard data visualization module for proteomics data analysis, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.05 (to reflect minimal inherent data handling risks but no real threat)",
