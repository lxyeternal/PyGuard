{
  "purpose": "Visualization functions for proteomics data analysis, including missingness, contaminants, intensities, PCA, volcano plots, and clustering, based on data from a Qtable object.",
  "sources": "Data fetched via methods like get_data(), make_sample_table(), get_experiments(), get_samples(), and design attributes of Qtable.",
  "sinks": "Generates matplotlib/seaborn plots; no external data transmission, file writing, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal Qtable data structures through processing functions into visualization outputs; no external or user-controlled code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic execution observed. Use of standard libraries and straightforward data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data visualization tasks for proteomics data, with routines for plotting missingness, contaminants, intensities, PCA, volcano plots, and clustering. It includes standard practices such as log-space detection, hierarchical clustering, and plotting with seaborn/matplotlib. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external communication are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscation: 0, low risk) are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, transparent, and solely intended for scientific visualization. No malicious or obfuscated code detected. The low security risk scores are justified. Overall, the reports are accurate and the scores appropriate.",
