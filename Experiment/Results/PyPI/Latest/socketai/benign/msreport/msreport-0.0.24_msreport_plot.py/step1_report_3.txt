{
  "purpose": "The code provides multiple visualization functions for analyzing proteomics data, including plots for missing values, contaminants, sample intensities, PCA, volcano plots, MA plots, expression comparisons, and clustering heatmaps.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the qtable object, including experiment data, sample data, intensity values, and metadata such as 'Valid' flags, 'Potential contaminant' flags, and experimental annotations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include plotting functions that generate figures, but no direct data exfiltration or network communication is present. No use of insecure eval or exec. No database or file writes are observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the qtable object to various plotting functions, where data is filtered, transformed (e.g., log transformations), and visualized. No untrusted external input sources or dynamic code execution are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code, is detected. The code predominantly performs standard data visualization and analysis procedures. No malicious network activity, file system access beyond plotting, or privilege escalation mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple data visualization functions relying on input from the qtable object, which appears to be a structured data container. Functions perform typical data processing like filtering, normalization, and plotting. No code injection, remote data access, or other malicious behaviors are observed. Use of third-party libraries is standard for visualization and data analysis. No signs of sabotage or hidden malicious code are evident. The only noteworthy aspect is the comprehensive plotting routines, but these do not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a collection of standard data visualization routines for proteomics data analysis. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The structure and logic are consistent with legitimate scientific plotting code, with no suspicious or malicious signals detected.",
