  "purpose": "This code provides several data imputation classes for handling missing values in pandas DataFrames, including fixed value, Gaussian, and Perseus-style imputation methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from pandas DataFrames provided as input to the fit and transform methods.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs imputed DataFrames; no untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or external system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> fit() calculates parameters -> transform() uses parameters and input DataFrame to generate imputed DataFrame, replacing missing values with generated data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code performs standard data imputation tasks without obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard data imputation classes with proper attribute checks and data processing routines. It relies solely on numpy and pandas for data manipulation, with no external or network interactions. The 'confirm_is_fitted' function ensures proper usage. The classes generate imputed values based on statistical methods, with options for fixed, Gaussian, or Perseus-style imputation. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or covert actions are evident. The code appears to be well-structured, clean, and typical for a data processing library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of data imputation techniques with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs statistical data filling, has no network or external system interactions, and contains no suspicious or obfuscated code.",
