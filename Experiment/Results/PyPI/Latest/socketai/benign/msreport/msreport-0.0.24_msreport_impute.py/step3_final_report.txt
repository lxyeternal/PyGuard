  "purpose": "Imputation classes for handling missing data in pandas DataFrames using fixed, Gaussian, and Perseus statistical methods.",
  "sources": "Reads input pandas DataFrames; accesses DataFrame columns for calculations.",
  "sinks": "Transforms DataFrames by replacing missing values; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "flows": "Source DataFrame → imputation methods → transformed DataFrame with imputed values.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out exception handling in FixedValueImputer.fit() indicates incomplete validation but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard data imputation techniques with clear, straightforward logic. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. It uses numpy and pandas for data processing, with no external communication or file I/O. The only minor concern is the incomplete validation code, which does not pose security risks. The use of seed parameters for reproducibility is standard. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and performs its intended purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of data imputation classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (around 0.1) are justified. No anomalies or security concerns are detected.",
