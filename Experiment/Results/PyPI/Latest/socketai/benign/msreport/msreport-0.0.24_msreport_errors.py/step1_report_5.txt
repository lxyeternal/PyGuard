{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes related to protein normalization and report errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data outputs or untrusted data handling in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs since the code only contains class definitions without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the class definitions are straightforward and conventional. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces three custom exception and warning classes with standard inheritance. These classes are typical in Python for signaling specific error conditions and do not perform any operations themselves. There are no input sources, data flows, or sinks, nor any complex or unusual code behavior. The code appears to serve as part of a larger package for handling protein data, with no malicious or suspicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines custom error and warning classes for use elsewhere in a larger application. There are no security concerns associated with this code snippet.",
