  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes for error handling in a Python library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exception and warning classes.",
  "sinks": "No data input, output, or external data handling; no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "None; the code only declares classes without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for custom exceptions and warnings, inheriting from standard Python classes. There are no data inputs, external interactions, or executable logic. The code is simple, clear, and adheres to standard practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the benign, definitional nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception and warning classes with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
