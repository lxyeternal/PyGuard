  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes for a protein normalization or analysis library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; this code only declares classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions inheriting from built-in exception and warning classes. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The classes serve as custom exceptions and warnings, which are common in Python libraries for handling specific error conditions. No obfuscated code, malicious code, or security risks are present. The code is straightforward and conventional for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious set of class definitions for exceptions and warnings. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
