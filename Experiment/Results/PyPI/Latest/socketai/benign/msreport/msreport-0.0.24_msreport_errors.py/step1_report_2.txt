{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes for handling errors and warnings related to protein normalization and FASTA files.",
  "sources": "No data input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or hidden operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions and warnings, inheriting from built-in Python exception and warning classes. There are no data input points, no processing logic, and no external communications. It appears to be standard practice for error handling in a scientific or data processing library, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, only defining custom exception and warning classes for use elsewhere in a larger codebase. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
