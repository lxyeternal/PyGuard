  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes for error handling in a protein normalization context.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; classes are defining exception types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class definitions for exceptions and warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class declarations with no executable code or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom classes: MsreportError, NotFittedError, and ProteinsNotInFastaWarning, which are standard practice for custom exception and warning handling in Python. There is no evidence of data input, data processing, or any behavior that could be malicious. The classes do not include any methods or code that could be exploited or contain hidden malicious code. This appears to be a straightforward, benign setup for error handling in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It establishes custom exception and warning classes, which are typical and safe. No malicious behavior or security issues are present.",
