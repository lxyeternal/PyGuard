  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the underlying code:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code only defines three classes: `MsreportError`, `NotFittedError`, and `ProteinsNotInFastaWarning`.\n   - These classes inherit from standard Python exception and warning classes.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external interactions, or executable logic.\n\n2. **Assessment of Potential Malicious Behavior or Security Risks:**\n   - No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The classes are purely definitional, serving as custom exceptions/warnings.\n   - No evidence of data flow, data handling, or external communication.\n   - No signs of malware, malicious code, or exploits.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent and appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security threat.\n\n4. **Logic and Reasoning Validity:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is standard, non-malicious, and only defines custom exceptions and warnings.\n   - The analysis is thorough, noting the lack of data handling, external interactions, or complex logic.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - No. The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is purely definitional, even a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The consistent assignment of 0 for malware and obfuscated scores is appropriate.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is a standard pattern for custom exception and warning classes in Python.\n- No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**Estimated Scores (My assessment):**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores are appropriate, and there is no indication of security issues or malicious activity.",
