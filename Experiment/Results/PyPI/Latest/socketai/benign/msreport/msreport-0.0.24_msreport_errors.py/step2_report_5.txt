  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code only defines three classes:\n     - `MsreportError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n     - `NotFittedError` inheriting from `ValueError` and `AttributeError`.\n     - `ProteinsNotInFastaWarning` inheriting from `UserWarning`.\n   - There are no executable functions, data handling, or external interactions.\n   - The classes are straightforward, serving as custom exceptions and warnings.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are evident.\n   - The code is standard for error handling in Python libraries.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that this is just class definitions with no data flow or external interactions.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n   - The conclusion that this code is benign and non-malicious is accurate.\n\n4. **Score Justification:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Maliciousness:**\n   - Since the code only declares classes, there is no malware or malicious intent.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The risk score should also be 0, as there's no security threat.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly stating that the code is benign and standard.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is purely definitional for custom exceptions and warnings.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk is present.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, I concur with the existing scores. They are accurate and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, safe set of class definitions for exception handling, with no security concerns.",
