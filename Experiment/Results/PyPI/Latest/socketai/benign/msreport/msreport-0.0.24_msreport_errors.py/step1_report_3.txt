{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes for handling specific errors and warnings related to protein normalization and FASTA file queries.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data output, storage, or external communication operations are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists, as the code only defines classes without executing data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for exceptions and warnings, which are standard in Python. There are no input handling, data processing, or external communication routines. The classes inherit from common base classes without any additional logic or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines custom exceptions and warnings for error handling in a protein normalization context. It appears benign and follows standard practices without any malicious or suspicious elements.",
