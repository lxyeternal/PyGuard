  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency, correctness, and appropriate scoring.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only defines custom exception and warning classes without any data input, processing, or external interactions. There are no vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly note that the code is straightforward, standard practice, and benign. No logical errors or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious behavior.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is purely definitional with no runtime behavior, no data handling, and no external interactions, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted. The reports' scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is correctly assigned as 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as benign and standard.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the code and the analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I concur with the current scores. No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is standard, non-malicious, and poses no security risk.  \n- The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are correct.  \n- No changes are needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Accept the current assessments.",
