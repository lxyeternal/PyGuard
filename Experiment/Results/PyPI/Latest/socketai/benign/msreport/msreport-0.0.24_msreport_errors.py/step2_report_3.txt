  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions and warnings. There are no data inputs, outputs, external interactions, or executable logic. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is purely definitional and benign. They do not overlook any suspicious constructs or potential vulnerabilities. The reasoning appears sound and consistent across all reports.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious code or behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   Since there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious. The classes inherit from standard exceptions and warnings without any additional logic or dynamic code execution.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is purely definitional with no malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, non-malicious set of class definitions for exceptions and warnings, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. It is typical boilerplate for error handling in Python libraries.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are needed. The code is safe, benign, and poses no security threat.",
