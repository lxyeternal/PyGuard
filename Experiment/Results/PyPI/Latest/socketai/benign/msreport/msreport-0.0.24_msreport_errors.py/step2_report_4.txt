  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as only defining custom exception and warning classes.\n- The code contains no data input/output, external interactions, or executable logic.\n- The code is straightforward, following standard Python practices.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are simple class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions or warnings.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- The purpose is solely to facilitate error handling in a larger library, which is typical and safe.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is justified given the benign, definitional nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are 0, appropriate since there are no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is safe, standard, and non-malicious.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** This code snippet is a typical, harmless setup for custom exceptions and warnings, with no security or malicious implications.",
