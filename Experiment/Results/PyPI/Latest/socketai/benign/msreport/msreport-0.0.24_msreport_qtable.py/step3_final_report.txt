{
  "purpose": "The code manages proteomics data through pandas DataFrames, providing functions for data access, validation, and file I/O, with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "File reading functions (_read_csv_str_safe), data attribute access, and helper functions for sample column identification.",
  "sinks": "File writing (to_csv, yaml.safe_dump), clipboard (to_clipboard), and data manipulation within pandas DataFrames.",
  "flows": "Data is read from files into pandas DataFrames, processed or validated in memory, and then written back to files or clipboard; no external network or system commands are invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data flows detected. Usage of warnings.warn for deprecation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured data management class for proteomics datasets, with standard pandas and yaml operations. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. Data validation and file handling are performed safely. Helper functions are straightforward and do not introduce malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and transparent data utility with no indicators of malicious activity or sabotage. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
