  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements and a version string.\n- No data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded credentials are detected.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger scientific data analysis package, specifically for mass spectrometry.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The actual code snippet does **not** contain any executable logic beyond imports and a version declaration.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.\n- The code is benign and typical for a package setup or initialization module.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are present in the report summaries.\n- The reasoning is consistent: the code is just import statements, so the security risk is minimal.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is justified; no malicious activity is indicated.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- Since the code is purely import statements, the risk scores should remain very low.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis correctly identifies the code as harmless.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The import statements are standard for a scientific analysis package, and no runtime data flow or external interactions are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scoring. No changes are necessary. The overall security posture based on this code snippet is very low risk.",
