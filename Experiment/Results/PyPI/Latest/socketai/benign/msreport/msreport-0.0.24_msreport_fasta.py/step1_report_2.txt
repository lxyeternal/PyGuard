{
  "purpose": "The code generates a protein database from one or multiple fasta files by parsing their contents and adding entries to a ProteinDatabase instance.",
  "sources": "Reads input paths from the parameter 'fasta_path', which can be a string, pathlib.Path, or an iterable of these types.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'database.add_fasta' with each path, which potentially reads the fasta files from disk; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input paths from 'fasta_path' are processed into a list, then each path is passed to 'database.add_fasta' for reading and parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no unusual behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The function accepts input paths in various formats, normalizes them into a list, and iteratively processes each one by adding fasta data into a database. The code relies on the 'ProteinDatabase' class's 'add_fasta' method for file reading and parsing. The method is presumed to handle file I/O securely. No embedded or hardcoded secrets are found. The structure and logic are straightforward. The code appears to be a standard utility function for biological data processing, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard data ingestion utility for biological sequences with no malicious behavior detected. It performs file reading and data processing as expected in a bioinformatics context. No security concerns or malicious patterns are evident.",
