{
  "purpose": "The code generates a protein database from one or multiple FASTA files, allowing for header parsing customization.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'fasta_path' which accepts file paths or iterables of file paths.",
  "sinks": "The 'add_fasta' method called on 'database' object, which processes each provided file path.",
  "flows": "The code reads file paths from 'fasta_path' and passes each path to 'database.add_fasta', which is a sink that likely reads the file contents.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no unusual behavior observed. The code uses standard library modules and a class method with clear intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to import protein data from FASTA files into a database object. It handles single or multiple file inputs gracefully. The main operations involve creating a database instance and adding FASTA files to it. The 'add_fasta' method's implementation is not shown, but assuming it reads files normally, there are no signs of malicious code. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious behavior detected. The overall code appears to perform standard data processing with no security risks evident within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for loading FASTA files into a database object. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities in this code fragment.",
