{
  "purpose": "Generates a protein database from one or multiple FASTA files by adding each file's contents to the database.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as input, read by the add_fasta method within ProteinDatabase.",
  "sinks": "None directly within this code; potential risks depend on the implementation of add_fasta.",
  "flows": "Input paths -> add_fasta called for each path -> data loaded into ProteinDatabase.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward handling of input paths and delegation to external method.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts either a single path or an iterable of paths, normalizes the input, and iterates over each path to populate a ProteinDatabase via add_fasta. No suspicious or malicious code is present; the security depends on add_fasta's implementation. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution are detected. The code is clear, idiomatic, and standard for such data loading tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and primarily hinges on the external add_fasta method. Given the straightforward nature and absence of suspicious patterns, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1. The overall assessment indicates a safe utility function suitable for its purpose.",
