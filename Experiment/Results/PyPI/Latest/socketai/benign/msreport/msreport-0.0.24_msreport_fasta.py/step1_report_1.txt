{
  "purpose": "To generate a protein database from one or multiple FASTA files, parsing headers with a specified parser.",
  "sources": "Reads input paths via the 'fasta_path' argument, which can be a string, pathlib.Path, or iterable of such.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'database.add_fasta' with each path; potential sink if 'add_fasta' executes untrusted code or handles untrusted input insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input paths are collected into 'paths' list, then passed one by one to 'database.add_fasta' as the source for database entries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or unusual code patterns. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The function primarily processes file paths and calls a method to add FASTA data to a database. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. Security depends on the implementation of 'ProteinDatabase.add_fasta', which isn't provided here. Based solely on this code, it appears to be standard file handling and data processing. No malicious or maliciously intended code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It safely processes provided file paths to generate a protein database. Its security largely depends on the safety of 'add_fasta', but no direct malicious activity is present in this snippet.",
