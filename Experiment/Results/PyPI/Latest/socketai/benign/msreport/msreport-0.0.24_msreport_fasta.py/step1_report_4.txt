{
  "purpose": "The function generates a protein database from one or multiple FASTA files, parsing headers according to a specified parser.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'fasta_path' argument, which can be a string, pathlib.Path, or an iterable of these types.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the 'add_fasta' method of 'ProteinDatabase', which may process or load the file contents; however, without implementation details, no direct malicious activity can be confirmed.",
  "flows": "Input 'fasta_path' -> iterates over 'paths' -> calls 'database.add_fasta' for each path.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution. The code appears to use standard library and a third-party module 'profasta.db'.",
  "analysis": "The code simply accepts file paths, processes them into a list if needed, and calls an 'add_fasta' method on a database object. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The import of 'pathlib' and typing modules is standard. The 'add_fasta' method's behavior is unknown but assumed to process files normally. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected. The code's purpose aligns with standard data processing functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for loading FASTA files into a protein database object. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
