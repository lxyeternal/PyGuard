  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, domain-specific proteomics data processing library. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The overall security risk is very low, primarily limited to file handling, which is standard in such pipelines. The untested functions are development artifacts, not indicators of sabotage or malicious intent."
