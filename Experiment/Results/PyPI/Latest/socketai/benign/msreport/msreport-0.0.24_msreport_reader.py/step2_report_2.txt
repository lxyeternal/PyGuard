  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Describes classes/functions for reading and processing proteomics data, with no external command execution or network activity. Several functions are marked \"not tested,\" indicating incomplete implementation but not malicious intent.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Scores are zero; no obfuscation or malware detected.\n- **Risk:** Low (0.2). The code is standard for data processing, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar focus on data parsing and annotation, with no network or system commands. Contains \"not tested\" comments but no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Zero.\n- **Risk:** Slightly lower (0.1), reflecting high confidence in benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, data parsing and annotation, with reliance on external databases. No code injection or network activity. Contains \"not tested\" comments but no malicious intent.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Zero.\n- **Risk:** Slightly higher (0.1), but overall benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with data parsing, annotation, and no network/system commands. Mentions \"not tested\" functions but no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Zero.\n- **Risk:** Very low (0.05).\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Focused on data reading and annotation, with no network or command execution. Mentions directory reading but no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Zero.\n- **Risk:** Slightly higher (0.2), but still within benign scope.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity (0). The code is purely data processing, with no signs of backdoors, code injection, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports; code is clear, standard Python with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly due to untested functions and incomplete implementation, which are typical in development, not malicious.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code's purpose is domain-specific data parsing and annotation, with no external command execution, network activity, or hidden code.\n- The presence of \"not tested\" comments suggests ongoing development, not malicious intent.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or backdoors are present.\n- The code adheres to standard bioinformatics data processing practices.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (considering minor uncertainties due to untested functions but overall benign)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. It is a well-structured data processing library with no supply chain security concerns.",
