{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for reading, processing, and annotating proteomics data tables from MaxQuant, FragPipe, and Spectronaut, converting them into a standardized MsReport format for downstream analysis.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations reading specific result files; pandas DataFrames for data manipulation; string parsing functions extracting identifiers and modifications.",
  "sinks": "In-memory DataFrames; no external system commands, network calls, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "File reading functions load data into DataFrames; parsing functions extract identifiers and modifications; annotation functions enrich data; DataFrames are processed and returned for further use.",
  "anomalies": "Functions marked 'not tested' indicate incomplete implementation but do not suggest malicious intent; no secrets, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard bioinformatics data processing: reading files, cleaning data, parsing strings, annotating proteins, and calculating coverage. It relies solely on safe Python libraries and standard file operations. No network activity, system commands, or hidden payloads are present. The untested functions are typical during development and do not imply malicious behavior. The code structure is transparent and domain-specific, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, domain-specific proteomics data processing library. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The overall security risk is very low, primarily limited to file handling, which is standard in such pipelines. The untested functions are development artifacts, not indicators of sabotage or malicious intent.",
