  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scoring, and potential security concerns step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:** The code provides normalization classes, no malicious behavior, standard statistical methods, external libraries are typical, no obfuscation, and the overall security risk is very low.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- External dependencies (numpy, pandas, statsmodels) are standard.\n- No network, file I/O, or dynamic code execution.\n- The report's malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is legitimate, performing standard normalization, no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and standard libraries.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.\n- Data flows are typical for data normalization.\n- External libraries are standard.\n- Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- Security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:** Again, standard normalization routines, no suspicious activity, no obfuscation, and external libraries are typical.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- No network or system commands.\n- The code is straightforward data processing.\n- Malware score of 0 matches the analysis.\n- Security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:** The code implements normalization methods, validation functions, no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and external dependencies are standard.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No malicious intent or backdoors.\n- Data validation and normalizer classes are typical.\n- The only minor concern is the return of internal state data, but this is standard for models/parameters, not malicious.\n- Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- Security risk score of 0.1 is slightly conservative but acceptable given the data exposure.\n\n**Verdict:** **Reasonable, though slightly cautious, but consistent.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:** Same pattern: normalization utilities, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, standard data analysis libraries, no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Data flow and validation are typical.\n- Malware score of 0 aligns.\n- Security risk score of 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is standard data normalization routines with no malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- **Malware Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly 0, with a few at 0.1, which is conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0.05** (a very low, conservative estimate considering the minor caution in report 4)\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious code.  \n- The code performs standard statistical normalization tasks.  \n- External libraries are common in data science workflows.  \n- Validation functions prevent misuse, but do not introduce security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the code appears benign. The scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
