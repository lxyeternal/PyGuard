  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements various normalization classes (fixed-value, value-dependent, median, mode, lowess, categorical, z-score). It relies on standard data science libraries and internal validation functions. No suspicious behavior or malicious code detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code appears clear.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no security concerns.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code. No issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard normalization techniques with validation and no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No anomalies or malicious indicators. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on proteomics data normalization, standard statistical operations, validation, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a typical normalization utility with no malicious signs.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar normalization classes, validation, and data handling, with a note on the internal state being returned, which is standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — slightly higher, but justified as the code returns internal normalization parameters, which could be misused if the code were part of a malicious pipeline.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity, but the slight security risk score reflects that returning internal state could be misused if exploited, but the code itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard normalization techniques, no suspicious behavior, with validation functions and no external threats.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — similar reasoning as Report 4.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is legitimate, with minimal risk associated with data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly 0, with a couple of reports assigning 0.1 due to the internal state being exposed or returned, which is a minor concern but not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, justified by the potential misuse of returning internal parameters, but overall the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured collection of normalization utilities for scientific data processing, with no malicious intent or sabotage detected. The minor security risk score reflects that exposing internal parameters could be exploited in a malicious context, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low-risk assessment, but consider restricting access to internal state data if used in security-sensitive environments.",
