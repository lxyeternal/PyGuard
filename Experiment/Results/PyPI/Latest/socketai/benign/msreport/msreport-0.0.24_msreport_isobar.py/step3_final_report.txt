{
  "purpose": "Performs isotope impurity correction on reporter expression data, validating input matrices and applying correction algorithms.",
  "sources": "Reads impurity matrices, input intensity tables, and helper functions for logspace detection.",
  "sinks": "Processes data internally; no external data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation, correction functions, and helper utilities, resulting in corrected data outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard scientific correction routines with proper validation checks (matrix squareness, NaN handling). It uses numpy and scipy libraries appropriately, and external helper functions appear legitimate. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or insecure data handling are present. The data flow is typical for scientific data processing, with no external network or file access. The use of scipy.optimize.nnls and helper functions is standard practice, and the code structure is clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate scientific software for isotope impurity correction, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
