{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions for isotope impurity correction in proteomics data analysis, specifically correcting reporter expression values using impurity matrices.",
  "sources": "Reads data from pandas DataFrame (table inputs) and numpy arrays (impurity matrices and intensity data). Uses msreport.helper.intensities_in_logspace to determine data space.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data directly; no data is sent over the network or written to files, and no user input is processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from DataFrame or numpy arrays through impurity correction functions, with no external or untrusted source feeding into sensitive sinks. The impurity matrices are used internally for mathematical corrections.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present. No dynamic code execution, encryption, or data exfiltration routines are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a protocol and classes for isotope impurity correction, using numpy and scipy for numerical operations. It performs input validation (e.g., shape checks, NaN checks) and applies corrections via matrix operations and least squares optimization. The function msreport.helper.intensities_in_logspace is invoked to determine data space, but this appears to be a legitimate helper function, not malicious. No external network calls, file access, or hidden behaviors are present. The code performs mathematical corrections typical of data processing workflows, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for data correction in proteomics analysis, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks detected. It follows standard numerical processing practices and uses external libraries appropriately.",
