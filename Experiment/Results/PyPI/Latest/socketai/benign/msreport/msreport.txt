      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and primarily hinges on the external add_fasta method. Given the straightforward nature and absence of suspicious patterns, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1. The overall assessment indicates a safe utility function suitable for its purpose."
