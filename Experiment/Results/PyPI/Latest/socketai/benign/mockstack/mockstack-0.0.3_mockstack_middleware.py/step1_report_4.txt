{
  "purpose": "Define middleware for the mockstack FastAPI application to measure processing time per request.",
  "sources": "The code reads request data and measures time using time.time().",
  "sinks": "Sets 'X-Process-Time' header in the response, which is a safe operation.",
  "flows": "Request received -> start_time recorded -> request processed -> response headers modified -> response returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a middleware to add processing time to HTTP responses. It uses time.time() to measure request duration and sets a custom header. No external data sources, no untrusted input handling beyond standard request processing, and no suspicious activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign function—measuring request processing time—and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
