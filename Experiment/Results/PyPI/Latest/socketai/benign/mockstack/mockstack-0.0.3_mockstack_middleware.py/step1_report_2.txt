{
  "purpose": "To define and add an HTTP middleware to measure and include processing time in the response headers for the mockstack application.",
  "sources": "None; the code only imports modules and defines functions, with no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or perform any data leakage operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; there are no untrusted data flows or source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard middleware registration and time measurement without suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports time and FastAPI modules, then defines a function to add middleware to a FastAPI app. The middleware measures request processing time and adds this as a response header. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or external network interactions. The purpose and structure are straightforward and typical for performance monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard middleware implementation for measuring request processing time. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and poses no security risks.",
