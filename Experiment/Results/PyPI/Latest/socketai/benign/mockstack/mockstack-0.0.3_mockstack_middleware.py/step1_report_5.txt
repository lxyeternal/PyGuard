  "purpose": "Define middleware for a FastAPI app to measure and add processing time to HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "import statements, function parameters, and variables within the middleware function (e.g., request, response, call_next, start_time, process_time).",
  "sinks": "modification of response.headers with 'X-Process-Time', reading request data (although not used here), and timing functions.",
  "flows": "Request is received, start_time recorded; call_next executes request handling; response time calculated; header 'X-Process-Time' added to response; response returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation. The code appears standard for adding middleware to measure request processing time.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a middleware provider function, and within it, adds an async middleware to measure processing time for each request. The start_time is captured before request processing; after processing, the elapsed time is calculated and added as a header. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or external communications. The code is straightforward and adheres to common FastAPI patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of middleware to measure request processing time in a FastAPI application. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
