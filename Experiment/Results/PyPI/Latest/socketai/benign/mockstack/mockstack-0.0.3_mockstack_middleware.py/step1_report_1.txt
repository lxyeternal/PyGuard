  "purpose": "Define and add an HTTP middleware to measure and include processing time in response headers for the mockstack app.",
  "sources": "import time, from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, from mockstack.config import Settings, function parameters",
  "sinks": "response.headers['X-Process-Time']",
  "flows": "Request received -> start_time recorded -> call_next(request) invoked -> response generated -> process_time calculated -> response.headers updated -> response returned",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic code execution, and no external network calls or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and FastAPI components, then defines a middleware provider function that adds a processing time header to responses. The middleware measures processing time between request receipt and response completion. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code's structure and usage are typical for a FastAPI middleware setup. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward middleware implementation for monitoring request processing time. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for performance instrumentation.",
