  "purpose": "Middleware to measure and add request processing time as a header in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Request object, call_next function for processing the request.",
  "sinks": "Response headers where 'X-Process-Time' is added.",
  "flows": "Request is received -> start timer -> call_next(request) processes request -> end timer -> add header to response.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, standard middleware pattern with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines a middleware that records start time, processes the request, calculates elapsed time, and adds it as a header. No external network calls, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is a typical performance monitoring middleware. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0. The only minor discrepancy is in one report assigning a security risk of 0.1, which is unjustified given the code's simplicity and safety. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard FastAPI middleware for measuring request processing time. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The security risk score should be 0, and malware score remains 0. All reports are consistent with this assessment.",
