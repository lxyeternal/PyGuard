  "purpose": "Define and add an HTTP middleware to measure and add process time headers in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Import of time module, Request object from fastapi, function parameters app and settings",
  "sinks": "Setting response headers with process time (response.headers['X-Process-Time'])",
  "flows": "Request is processed through middleware, timing is measured, process time is added to response headers",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no unusual or obfuscated code. No external network access or data manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a middleware in a FastAPI app to measure request processing time. It imports necessary modules, including time for timing. The middleware function captures start time, processes the request, calculates elapsed time, and adds this as a header to the response. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic indicates normal functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard middleware implementation for measuring request processing time. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign and typical pattern used in FastAPI applications.",
