  "purpose": "Initialize and configure OpenTelemetry tracing for a FastAPI application with optional external endpoint configuration.",
  "sources": "settings.opentelemetry.endpoint, metadata.distribution('mockstack')",
  "sinks": "OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint=settings.opentelemetry.endpoint) sends data to external endpoint",
  "flows": "settings.opentelemetry.endpoint (source) → OTLPSpanExporter (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious code behavior, no obfuscated code. External endpoint is configurable but not hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up OpenTelemetry tracing by retrieving distribution info and configuring an exporter with a user-defined endpoint. The endpoint is obtained from settings, allowing for flexible configuration. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. The exporter transmits telemetry data externally, but this is standard behavior for observability and not malicious. No backdoors, code injections, or privacy leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard OpenTelemetry setup for a FastAPI application with configurable external endpoint. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks identified. It appears safe and aligned with typical telemetry configuration.",
