  "purpose": "Initialize and configure OpenTelemetry tracing for a FastAPI application, including setting up resource attributes and exporting spans to an OTLP endpoint.",
  "sources": "settings.opentelemetry.endpoint (reads configuration for the OTLP exporter endpoint)",
  "sinks": "OTLPSpanExporter sends span data to an external endpoint specified in settings; no other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Configuration data from settings flows into the OTLPSpanExporter; trace spans are generated via FastAPI requests and exported.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of external metadata to determine service info is standard; no risky dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes OpenTelemetry tracing with resource attributes derived from package metadata. It sets up a batch span processor with an endpoint from configuration, which is typical. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident. The endpoint configuration could potentially be misconfigured externally but is not malicious by itself. Comments clarify the custom instrumentation approach, indicating deliberate design choices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of OpenTelemetry tracing setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly reads configuration data, sets up tracing, and exports spans to an external endpoint. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
