  "sources": "settings.opentelemetry.enabled, settings.opentelemetry.endpoint, metadata.distribution",
  "sinks": "OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint=settings.opentelemetry.endpoint)",
  "flows": "Settings flags and distribution info influence tracer setup; endpoint data flows from settings into OTLPSpanExporter",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code sets up OpenTelemetry tracing for a FastAPI app. It conditionally initializes the tracer provider and span processor based on configuration. It retrieves package distribution info dynamically and uses it to set resource attributes. The exporter endpoint is configured via settings, which could be externally controlled but is typical in such setups. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. It adheres to standard OpenTelemetry setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard OpenTelemetry integration with configurable endpoint. No malicious behavior or security risks identified. The only potential concern is that the endpoint is configurable, which could be manipulated if settings are not secured, but this is typical for telemetry setups.",
