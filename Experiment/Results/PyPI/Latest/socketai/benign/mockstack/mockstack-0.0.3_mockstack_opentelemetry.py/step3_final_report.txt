  "purpose": "Set up OpenTelemetry tracing for a FastAPI application with configurable endpoint and resource attributes derived from package metadata.",
  "sources": "The 'settings.opentelemetry.endpoint' configuration and package metadata via 'metadata.distribution(\"mockstack\")'.",
  "sinks": "The OTLPSpanExporter endpoint, which sends trace data to an external collector.",
  "flows": "Configuration value from 'settings' flows into 'OTLPSpanExporter', which transmits data to the specified endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally initializes OpenTelemetry tracing based on a settings flag, retrieves package info for resource attributes, and sets up an OTLP exporter with a configurable endpoint. No external inputs are untrusted, and the code follows standard practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only potential security concern is the endpoint configuration, which could be manipulated if settings are compromised, but this is typical for telemetry integrations and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard OpenTelemetry setup for FastAPI with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to configuration management, and scores are consistent with the observed code.",
