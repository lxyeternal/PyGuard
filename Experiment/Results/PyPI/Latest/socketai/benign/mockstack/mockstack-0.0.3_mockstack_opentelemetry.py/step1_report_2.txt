  "purpose": "Initialize OpenTelemetry tracing for a FastAPI application with configurable endpoint and resource attributes.",
  "sources": "settings.opentelemetry.enabled, settings.opentelemetry.endpoint, metadata.distribution",
  "targets": "OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint=...), tracer_provider, span_processor",
  "flows": "settings.opentelemetry.endpoint -> OTLPSpanExporter -> span_processor -> tracer_provider",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic configuration for endpoint; no hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated or suspicious code; no external inputs that are untrusted",
  "analysis": "The code initializes OpenTelemetry tracing with a configurable endpoint, dynamically obtained distribution info, and a resource with service name and version. It conditionally sets up tracing based on settings. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or code injection points are present. The data flow is straightforward from configuration to exporter and tracer setup. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard OpenTelemetry setup for a FastAPI app, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly uses configuration parameters and external libraries for observability purposes without introducing security concerns.",
