  "purpose": "Define application configuration settings for mockstack, including OpenTelemetry, request handling strategies, directory paths, metadata injections, and logging.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (via pydantic settings), potential file paths (templates_dir, .env file), environment variables for settings values.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified; no data is transmitted, stored insecurely, or executed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and .env file -> pydantic BaseSettings parsing -> application configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of template strings within default dictionary values for resource metadata. No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. No malicious code or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration classes using pydantic, with defaults and environment variable overrides. No user input or untrusted data is processed at runtime beyond standard configuration loading. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system modification is present. The only notable aspect is the use of template strings within default values, which is a common pattern for dynamic resource metadata and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for a mock server environment, with no indicators of malicious behavior or malware. It appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
