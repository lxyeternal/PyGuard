  "purpose": "Configuration and settings management for a mock server setup with optional OpenTelemetry integration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (via pydantic settings), potentially from .env file, and default attribute values within the code.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects; settings are primarily configuration data used internally.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or .env file → pydantic settings objects → application configuration used in runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The code appears standard for configuration management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines structured settings classes with default values, environment variable support, and caching. No code executes external commands, reads untrusted input at runtime, or performs network actions. There are no hardcoded credentials or secrets; default endpoint is localhost. The use of templates in resource metadata involves string interpolation but no dangerous code execution is evident. The overall structure is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a standard configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on environment variables and default values, with no external data flows that pose threats.",
