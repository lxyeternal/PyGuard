  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration setup with templated default values. There is no evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or active vulnerabilities. The main concern is the potential misuse of the templating system at runtime, but this does not constitute malware or malicious behavior in the static code. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect a low security risk."
