  "purpose": "Initialize and configure a FastAPI application with settings, middleware, routers, and observability providers.",
  "sources": "Configuration provider functions (settings_provider, lifespan_provider, etc.) that supply settings and components to the app.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data directly.",
  "flows": "Settings and components flow from provider functions into the FastAPI app object during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard FastAPI application bootstrap, importing configuration and setup functions, creating an app, applying providers, and exposing the app object. All provider functions are external, and their internal security is unknown, but within this snippet, no malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The code does not handle untrusted data directly, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0-0.2) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured FastAPI bootstrap script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent. Overall, the code is safe and can be considered free of supply chain security risks based solely on this snippet.",
