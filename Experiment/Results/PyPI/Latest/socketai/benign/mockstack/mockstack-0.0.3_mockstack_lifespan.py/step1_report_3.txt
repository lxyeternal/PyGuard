  "purpose": "Manage the lifecycle of a FastAPI application using a context manager that configures logging and displays an announcement.",
  "sources": "Import statements for configuration and display functions, the lifespan_provider function, and its internal lifespan async context manager.",
  "sinks": "Potential configuration of logging with dictConfig, invocation of announce(settings) which might display information.",
  "flows": "Settings are passed into lifespan_provider, used within lifespan to configure logging and announce. No untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward lifecycle management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to provide a lifespan context manager for FastAPI, configuring logging from provided settings and calling an announce function. All code appears standard for application lifecycle setup, with no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leaks. The functions and imports are typical, and no untrusted data input handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard application lifecycle setup for FastAPI with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It primarily manages logging configuration and display announcements during startup.",
