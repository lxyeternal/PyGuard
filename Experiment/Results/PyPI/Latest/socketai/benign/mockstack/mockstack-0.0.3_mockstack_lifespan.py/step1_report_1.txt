{
  "purpose": "The code provides a lifecycle management function for a FastAPI application, configuring logging and announcing startup messages.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, fastapi, and mockstack modules; the lifespan_provider function receives Settings object; config.dictConfig and announce functions are called within lifespan.",
  "sinks": "config.dictConfig and announce are executed during the application lifespan; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "settings object -> config.dictConfig and announce during lifespan execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lifespan_provider that returns an async context manager for FastAPI. It configures logging using provided settings and announces application startup. All functions used appear standard and legitimate. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No anomalies or unusual code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended for managing FastAPI application lifecycle events, with proper logging configuration and startup announcement. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are identified.",
