      "confidence": 1,
      "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, performing standard startup logging with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor security consideration is the potential exposure of configuration details in logs, which is typical in operational environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to potential info leakage if logs are exposed. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use."

      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration setup with templated default values. There is no evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or active vulnerabilities. The main concern is the potential misuse of the templating system at runtime, but this does not constitute malware or malicious behavior in the static code. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect a low security risk."

The heuristic ID detection is benign and does not introduce vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The slight security risk score of 0.2 in one report is conservative but acceptable. Overall, the code is benign and well-structured."
