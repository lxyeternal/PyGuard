  "purpose": "Logging startup information and displaying colored output based on settings.",
  "sources": "Settings object properties: settings.strategy, settings.templates_dir, settings.opentelemetry.enabled, settings.opentelemetry.endpoint, settings.opentelemetry.capture_response_body.",
  "sinks": "Logging output that includes settings values; these could be visible in log files or console.",
  "flows": "Settings properties are read and directly formatted into log messages; no user input or external data is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets beyond display colors, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard logging and a Settings object, then defines ANSI escape sequences for colored output. The announce() function logs a startup message incorporating various properties of the Settings object, such as strategy, templates_dir, and opentelemetry configuration. All data used is sourced from the Settings object, which presumably is configured elsewhere; there are no external inputs or user data processed here. The logging output is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior like data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of color codes is benign, intended only for terminal display.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility displaying configuration info with colored formatting. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code is safe and does not pose security risks.",
