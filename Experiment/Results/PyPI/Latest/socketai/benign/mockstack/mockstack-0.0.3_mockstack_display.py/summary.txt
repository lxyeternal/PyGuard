  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, performing standard startup logging with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor security consideration is the potential exposure of configuration details in logs, which is typical in operational environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to potential info leakage if logs are exposed. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use."
