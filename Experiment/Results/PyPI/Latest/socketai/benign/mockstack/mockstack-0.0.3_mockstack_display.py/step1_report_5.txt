{
  "purpose": "Provide display and logging functionality for startup messages using color formatting and configuration settings.",
  "sources": "Settings object attributes: settings.strategy, settings.templates_dir, settings.opentelemetry.enabled, settings.opentelemetry.endpoint, settings.opentelemetry.capture_response_body",
  "sinks": "Logging output via logger.info, which writes formatted messages to log files or console",
  "flows": "Settings attributes → formatted strings → logger.info calls → log output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code or backdoors, no obfuscated code, no external network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines ANSI color codes for formatting console output and a function 'announce' that logs configuration details at startup. It retrieves configuration values from the Settings object and logs them with colored formatting. The logging statements use the standard logging module without user input or untrusted data sources. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious data flows. The code operates within expected boundaries for logging and display purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs straightforward logging of configuration information with color formatting. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The use of settings attributes is safe as they are presumably configured internally and not derived from user input.",
