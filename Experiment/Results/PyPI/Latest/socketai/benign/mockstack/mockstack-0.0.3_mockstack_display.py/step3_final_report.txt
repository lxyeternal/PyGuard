  "purpose": "Logging startup configuration details with ANSI color formatting for terminal display.",
  "sources": "Reads attributes from the Settings object: strategy, templates_dir, opentelemetry.enabled, opentelemetry.endpoint, opentelemetry.capture_response_body.",
  "sinks": "Logs output via the 'uvicorn' logger, which could be intercepted if logging is misconfigured.",
  "flows": "Settings attributes are formatted into log messages and output through the logger.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data processing detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward logging utility that outputs configuration details with color formatting. It reads data from a Settings object and logs it without executing untrusted code or external calls. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The only potential concern is that logging configuration details could expose sensitive info if logs are not protected, but this is a common operational consideration rather than a flaw. The use of ANSI codes is benign, and the code's purpose is purely informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, performing standard startup logging with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor security consideration is the potential exposure of configuration details in logs, which is typical in operational environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to potential info leakage if logs are exposed. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
