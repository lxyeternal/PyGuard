  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for utility purposes. The heuristic ID detection is benign and does not introduce vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The slight security risk score of 0.2 in one report is conservative but acceptable. Overall, the code is benign and well-structured."
