{
  "purpose": "Provide template inference and error messaging for a web application using FastAPI, based on URL paths and request data.",
  "sources": "Request URL path, request headers, request query parameters",
  "sinks": "Template filename generation, string formatting for filenames",
  "flows": "Input from request URL and headers flows into filename inference and context parsing; filename components are constructed from these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on standard parsing and string operations. No unsafe eval, exec, or network activity is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs URL path parsing, context extraction, and filename inference based on request data. Functions like 'looks_like_id' and 'prefixes' are used but are imported and presumably standard. No indications of malicious logic or suspicious behavior. The code does not perform external network calls, data exfiltration, or contain hidden backdoors. It relies on straightforward string manipulation, template name inference, and structured data extraction. The use of request headers and URL paths does not suggest malicious intent, and no user input is directly executed or injected into dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard template handling utility that infers template names and contexts from request data. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be well-structured and safe.",
