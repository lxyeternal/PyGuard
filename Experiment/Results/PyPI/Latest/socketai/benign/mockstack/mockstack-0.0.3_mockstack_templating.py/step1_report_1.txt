{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to infer and generate template filenames and contexts for handling HTTP requests in a FastAPI application, primarily for rendering templates based on request data.",
  "sources": "Request URL path, request headers (Content-Type, query parameters), and request body are read for processing.",
  "sinks": "Template filename generation functions produce filenames based on parsed URL segments and context, which could be used to load template files. No direct sinks that execute untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The request URL and headers are parsed to generate potential template names and contexts. These are used to determine which template files to load, based on URL structure and context extraction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns observed. The code relies on well-defined parsing and filename generation logic. No obfuscated code, unusual control flows, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL parsing, context extraction, and filename inference for template rendering. It uses functions like 'looks_like_id' and 'prefixes' to identify IDs and generate filename variations, which are typical in dynamic template selection logic. No external data is executed, and no security-critical operations like code execution, system commands, or network communication are detected. The logic appears safe and intended for template rendering workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of a template rendering system, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes request data for template selection without executing or exposing sensitive data in an insecure manner.",
