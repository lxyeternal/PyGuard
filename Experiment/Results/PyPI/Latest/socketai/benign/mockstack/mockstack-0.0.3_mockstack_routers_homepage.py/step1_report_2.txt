  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the endpoint returns a static JSON response.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and standard for route definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to provide a FastAPI router with a single endpoint '/' returning a static greeting. There are no input handling, no processing of untrusted data, and no external data fetching or code execution. The imports are standard, and the function structure is typical for FastAPI route setup. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are present.",
