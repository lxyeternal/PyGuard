  "purpose": "Define and provide a FastAPI router for the homepage endpoint.",
  "sources": "Imports from fastapi and mockstack.config; function parameters app and settings.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Function receives app and settings, creates a router, and defines a simple GET endpoint returning static data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution. The code is straightforward and standard for a route setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to create a FastAPI APIRouter with a single GET route at '/'. The route returns a static JSON object with 'Hello':'World'. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for a homepage route in a FastAPI application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign route definition for a FastAPI application with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
