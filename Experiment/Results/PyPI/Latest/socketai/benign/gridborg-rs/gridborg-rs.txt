      "conclusion": "The code is a benign re-export pattern with a minor style concern due to the use of 'import *'. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary issue is the potential runtime error if 'gridborg_rs' is not properly imported or defined elsewhere. The scores of zero for malware and obfuscation, and a low risk score (~0.1), are justified and consistent with the analysis."
