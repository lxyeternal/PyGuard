{
  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'gridborg_rs' and set the module's documentation and export list accordingly.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .gridborg_rs import *' imports all public objects from the 'gridborg_rs' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code only sets module documentation and export list.",
  "flows": "Imports data from 'gridborg_rs' and assigns its documentation and export list to the current module's attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered poor practice due to obscurity; however, it does not itself indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a sibling module 'gridborg_rs'. It then assigns the imported module's '__doc__' string to its own '__doc__', and if the module has an '__all__' attribute, it copies that list as well. There are no suspicious functions, data handling, or network activity. The use of 'import *' is a potential concern for code clarity, but it is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module wrapper that re-exports documentation and symbols from 'gridborg_rs'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this snippet.",
