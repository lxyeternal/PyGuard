  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the code snippet.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .gridborg_rs import *\n\n__doc__ = gridborg_rs.__doc__\nif hasattr(gridborg_rs, \"__all__\"):\n    __all__ = gridborg_rs.__all__\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code **performs a star import** from a local module `gridborg_rs`.\n- It **assigns** the `__doc__` attribute from `gridborg_rs`.\n- If `gridborg_rs` has an `__all__` attribute, it **copies** it over.\n\n**No evidence of malicious behavior** such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code is a straightforward wrapper or re-exporter.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Re-exports documentation and symbols; star import is noted but not malicious.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues. The low security risk score is reasonable, given the benign nature.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; star import is a style concern but not malicious.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity. The concern about namespace pollution is valid but not security-related.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern; no suspicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Valid; no issues.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Re-exporting module's docstring and `__all__`; no malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern; notes that wildcard import can obscure dependencies but is not malicious.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) is reasonable due to potential namespace pollution, but it does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting style concerns but no security threats.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n- The code is a simple re-export wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The use of `import *` is a style concern but not a security issue.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or data leaks.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the style concern about `import *`, but overall very low risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores assigned are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior. The main concern is the style of using `import *`, which is not recommended but does not pose a security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe code is benign. No changes needed to the scores. The overall security posture is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation present.",
