{
  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from the 'gridborg_rs' module and sets the module's docstring and __all__ attribute accordingly.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .gridborg_rs import *, access to gridborg_rs.__doc__, and gridborg_rs.__all__",
  "sinks": "None directly, as the code only performs imports and attribute assignments.",
  "flows": "Import from 'gridborg_rs' module to the current namespace; reading __doc__ and __all__ attributes from 'gridborg_rs'",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) can obscure which functions or variables are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unwanted code. No explicit code execution, obfuscation, or malicious actions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a local module 'gridborg_rs', then copies its documentation string and '__all__' attribute if present. This is a common pattern for re-exporting module contents. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or hidden backdoors. The wildcard import can be risky if 'gridborg_rs' contains malicious or unintended code, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or anomalous features aside from the use of wildcard import.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple re-export pattern, with no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The use of wildcard import warrants caution but does not necessarily imply malicious intent. Overall security risk appears low.",
