{
  "purpose": "This code imports all contents from the module 'gridborg_rs' and assigns its docstring to the current module's __doc__ attribute.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .gridborg_rs import *; attribute access to gridborg_rs.__doc__ and gridborg_rs.__all__",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or network operations",
  "flows": "Import from local module -> assignment of __doc__ and __all__ attributes",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure the specific imported components; no direct suspicious code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of all symbols from a local module 'gridborg_rs'. It then copies the module's docstring and __all__ list if present. No dynamic code execution, no network access, no suspicious data handling, and no obfuscated code are present. The use of 'import *' can sometimes hide malicious imports, but in this context, it appears to be a simple re-export or wrapper pattern.\n\nThere are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is minimal and standard in pattern, and it does not involve any data leakage, credential handling, or dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import wrapper that re-exports symbols and documentation from a local module. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The use of 'import *' should generally be avoided for clarity, but in this context, it does not indicate malicious intent.",
