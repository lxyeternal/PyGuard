{
  "purpose": "This code imports all contents from the module 'gridborg_rs' and assigns its docstring and __all__ attribute to the current module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .gridborg_rs import *, access to gridborg_rs.__doc__, and gridborg_rs.__all__ if it exists.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling, output, or data leak points.",
  "flows": "Imports entire module content, then copies docstring and __all__ attribute if present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of star import (*) can be considered a potential concern due to obscured dependencies and possible namespace pollution, but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of all symbols from a sibling module. It then assigns the imported module's docstring to the current module's __doc__, and if the module defines __all__, it copies this list over. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic present. The star import can obscure dependencies, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and mainly re-exports contents from a sibling module, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable aspect is the star import, which is a style concern rather than a security issue.",
