  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code performs a wildcard import from a local module `gridborg_rs`.\n- It then assigns the imported module's `__doc__` string to its own `__doc__`.\n- If the imported module has an `__all__` attribute, it copies that list as well.\n\n**Confirmed facts:**\n- The code is straightforward and minimal.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present.\n- The use of `import *` is generally discouraged for clarity but is not inherently malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5**: All agree on the benign nature of this code, emphasizing that it’s a simple re-export pattern with no malicious intent.\n\n**Common points:**\n- Use of `import *` is a style concern, not a security concern.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- No suspicious data flows, external communications, or code injection.\n- Slight variation in confidence levels (mostly 0.9), reflecting high confidence in benign assessment.\n- Slight differences in security risk scores (mostly 0.1 or 0.2), aligned with the style concern rather than actual security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the lack of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score**: Very low, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The use of `import *` could potentially import unwanted or malicious symbols if `gridborg_rs` is compromised, but on its own, this is a style issue, not a security flaw.\n- No evidence suggests this code introduces vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores**: Given the evidence, I would agree with the provided scores:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.1 (due to style concern but negligible security impact)\n\n- **Overall**: This code snippet appears benign and does not pose a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                                                                   |\n|--------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Clear, straightforward code; no obfuscation present.                                          |\n| Security Risk      | 0.1     | Minimal; mainly style concern with `import *`, but no security implications.               |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a simple re-export wrapper with no security concerns. The existing scores are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments provided.",
