{
  "purpose": "This code imports everything from the 'gridborg_rs' module and sets module documentation and export list based on it.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .gridborg_rs import *'",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data handling or external effects present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow analysis needed as there's no data processing or input/output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) can be considered a bad practice but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import from a local module, assigns the module's documentation string to its own, and conditionally copies the '__all__' attribute. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activities. The use of wildcard import could lead to namespace pollution but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears benign. It merely re-exports content from a local module. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
