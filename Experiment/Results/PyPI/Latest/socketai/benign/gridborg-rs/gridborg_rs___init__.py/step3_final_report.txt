  "purpose": "Re-export symbols and documentation from the gridborg_rs module for easier access and namespace management.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .gridborg_rs import *', accessing gridborg_rs.__doc__, hasattr(gridborg_rs, '__all__')",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "Imported symbols flow into current namespace; documentation and __all__ attributes are assigned from gridborg_rs",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure namespace and dependencies; potential missing explicit import of gridborg_rs module object",
  "analysis": "The code performs a wildcard import from a sibling module, then assigns its __doc__ and __all__ attributes if present. However, the code references 'gridborg_rs' directly without explicitly importing or defining it as a module object, which would cause a NameError at runtime unless 'gridborg_rs' is already in scope elsewhere. The use of 'import *' is a style concern but not malicious. No network activity, data leakage, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature, with the main concern being style rather than security. The code itself is straightforward and lacks malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign re-export pattern with a minor style concern due to the use of 'import *'. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary issue is the potential runtime error if 'gridborg_rs' is not properly imported or defined elsewhere. The scores of zero for malware and obfuscation, and a low risk score (~0.1), are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
