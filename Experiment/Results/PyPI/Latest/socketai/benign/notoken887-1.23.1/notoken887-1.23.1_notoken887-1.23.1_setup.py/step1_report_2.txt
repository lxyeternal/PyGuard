  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() call, including package metadata and description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling, user input, or external resource access observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The author email ('hitler@gmail.com') is suspicious and unprofessional; URL ('https://thugging.org') appears malicious or inappropriate. No code obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration script using setuptools. It defines package metadata without any dynamic code, input handling, or malicious constructs. The only notable points are suspicious contact information and URL, which may be indicative of malicious or inappropriate intent, but these are metadata elements, not functional code. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup configuration script with suspicious contact details and URL, but no malicious or security-risk behavior within the code itself.",
