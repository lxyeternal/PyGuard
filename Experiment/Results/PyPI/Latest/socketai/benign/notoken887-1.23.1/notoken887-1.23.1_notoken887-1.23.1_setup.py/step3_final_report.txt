  "purpose": "Static package setup configuration defining metadata for the 'notoken887' package.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static metadata fields in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static configuration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org', which are unprofessional and potentially provocative.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward 'setup.py' script using setuptools, containing static metadata with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The only notable anomalies are the suspicious contact details, which do not impact code security but could be used for social engineering or reputation damage. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as 0. The security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), primarily due to metadata suspicion. The code itself is benign; the concern is external metadata that could be exploited outside the code context.",
  "conclusion": "The package code is safe and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only issues are suspicious contact info and URL, which do not constitute malware but warrant caution. The scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the low security risk reflects metadata concerns.",
