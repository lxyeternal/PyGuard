  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging metadata for the 'notoken887' Python library.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or untrusted sources are read by this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of potentially suspicious author information ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org'), which may be intentionally provocative or malicious. The description mentions 'obfuscation test lib', but no obfuscation code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script that specifies package information such as name, version, author, description, and URL. No external input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution is present. The author email and URL are unusual and could be considered malicious or at least suspicious, but they do not constitute malware or security risk within the code. There are no obfuscation techniques, code injections, or malicious behaviors detected. The primary concern is the suspicious contact details, which may be malicious or maliciously intended.",
  "conclusion": "This package setup script is straightforward and does not contain malicious code. However, the author contact details and URL are suspicious and could indicate malicious intent outside of the code itself. From a security perspective, the code appears safe, but caution should be taken regarding the trustworthiness of the package based on metadata alone.",
