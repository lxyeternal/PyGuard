  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code signals such as obfuscation, suspicious patterns, and malicious actions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, external data inputs, command-line arguments, network requests, file operations, dynamic execution functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system modifications, system commands, environment variable access, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or user inputs to sinks such as network or file operations, possibly via dynamic execution or command injection.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, use of dynamic execution functions, misleading variable names, potential concealment of malicious code, lack of code clarity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent. External inputs are present but not validated, increasing risk. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network domains are identified. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to conceal malicious behavior, warranting a higher malware suspicion. The code's structure and signals point toward potential malicious activity, though no definitive malicious actions are confirmed. The suspicion level justifies a malware score of approximately 0.6, with obfuscation at 0.8 and security risk at 0.6, reflecting moderate to high concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows significant obfuscation and potential concealment of malicious behavior, warranting a malware score of 0.6 and a security risk of 0.6. While no explicit malicious actions are confirmed, the signals suggest caution. The overall assessment indicates a moderate to high threat level, and further dynamic analysis is recommended.",
