{
  "purpose": "This class provides a simple reversible obfuscation (not true encryption) for strings by replacing certain characters with symbols and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods.",
  "sinks": "Returned strings from 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods; no untrusted data flows to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via character replacements in 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, resulting in obfuscated or restored strings.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward character replacements; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No external data access or network activity is observed.",
  "analysis": "The class offers a simple character substitution cipher, which is not cryptographically secure but does not contain malicious code. No external inputs, data leakage, or suspicious operations are present. The code structure is clear and standard, with no obfuscation or hidden functionality. It purely performs in-memory string transformations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character substitution utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a basic obfuscation tool without any harmful side effects.",
