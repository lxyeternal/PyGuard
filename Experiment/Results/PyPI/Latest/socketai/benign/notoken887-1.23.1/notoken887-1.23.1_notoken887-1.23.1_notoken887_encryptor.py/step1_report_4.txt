  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution cipher methods to encrypt and decrypt strings by replacing specific characters with symbols and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "Returns of the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "flows": "Input string → replace characters → output encrypted string; Encrypted string → reverse replacements → decrypted string.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward character replacement cipher with no external input handling, no network communication, and no data leaks or external dependencies. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a basic character substitution cipher. There are no external data reads, network communications, or dynamic code execution. The cipher appears purely for simple obfuscation rather than security. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code is simple, straightforward, and does not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and does not contain malicious behavior. It performs a basic substitution cipher without any malicious intent or security risks.",
