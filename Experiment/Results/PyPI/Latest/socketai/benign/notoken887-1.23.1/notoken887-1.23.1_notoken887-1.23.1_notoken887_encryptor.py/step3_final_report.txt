  "purpose": "A simple class providing character substitution encryption and decryption functions for obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "The return statements of encrypt() and decrypt() functions, which output the transformed strings.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through sequential string replacements in encrypt() and decrypt() methods, transforming characters back and forth.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs static, straightforward character replacements with no external data or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic implementation of character substitution for obfuscation, with no external dependencies, network activity, or malicious logic. Both methods perform reversible string replacements, with no signs of obfuscation beyond simple character swaps. The code is transparent, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations. The assigned malware score of 0 is appropriate, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score of 0 is correct, given the code's simplicity. The security risk score of 0.1 reflects minimal concern due to potential misuse as an obfuscation tool, but overall it is benign. The confidence level is high (around 0.9-1), as the code's behavior is clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward character substitution utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
