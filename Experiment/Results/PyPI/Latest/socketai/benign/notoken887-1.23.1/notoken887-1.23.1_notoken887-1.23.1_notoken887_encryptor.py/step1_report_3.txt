{
  "purpose": "Provides simple character replacement encryption and decryption for strings, likely for obfuscation or basic data transformation.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods",
  "fires": "Returns transformed strings; no external untrusted data sources or sensitive data access present",
  "flows": "Input string → replace characters in 'encrypt' method → output encrypted string; encrypted string → replace characters in 'decrypt' method → output original string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code performs straightforward character replacements without external calls or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods performing bidirectional character replacements. These methods do not involve any external data sources, network activity, or system modifications. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The simplicity of the replacement logic suggests it is a basic obfuscation technique, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple obfuscation utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It neither accesses external systems nor executes harmful operations. It is safe based on this analysis.",
