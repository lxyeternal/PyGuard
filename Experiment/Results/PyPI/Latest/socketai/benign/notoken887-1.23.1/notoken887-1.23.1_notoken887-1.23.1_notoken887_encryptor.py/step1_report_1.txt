{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character-based encryption and decryption functions for obfuscating strings using character replacement mappings.",
  "sources": "The encrypt() and decrypt() methods read the input strings provided to them.",
  "sinks": "No typical data leaks or sensitive data exposure points are evident; the code performs only string replacement.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through replacement operations within the encrypt() and decrypt() methods, with no external data flow or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs straightforward character substitution without any obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The class performs simple, symmetric character substitution for obfuscation purposes. There are no external dependencies, no input/output beyond string manipulation, and no network or system interactions. The replacement pairs are static and do not involve any dynamic or unsafe operations. The code appears to be a benign obfuscation utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic character substitution utility intended for obfuscation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward, with no signs of malware or dangerous operations.",
