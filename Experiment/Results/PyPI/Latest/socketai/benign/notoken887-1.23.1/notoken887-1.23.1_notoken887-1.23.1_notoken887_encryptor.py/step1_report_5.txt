{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution encryption and decryption methods for strings using symbol replacements.",
  "sources": "The input string in the encrypt() method and the encrypted_token in the decrypt() method.",
  "sinks": "The return values from encrypt() and decrypt() methods; no external data sinks or network communication.",
  "flows": "Input string → replace substitutions in encrypt(); Encrypted string → reverse substitutions in decrypt().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The substitution cipher is simplistic and not secure but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward substitution cipher using string replacement. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or access untrusted data sources. The method names suggest encryption and decryption but the approach is rudimentary and not secure. No obfuscated code patterns, hidden behaviors, or malicious constructs are present. The code functions solely for string substitution, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a basic substitution cipher without malicious intent. It does not contain malware, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a simple utility for character replacement with no malicious behavior.",
