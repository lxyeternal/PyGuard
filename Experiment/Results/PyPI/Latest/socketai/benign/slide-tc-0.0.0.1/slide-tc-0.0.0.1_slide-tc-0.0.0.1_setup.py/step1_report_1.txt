  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'slide-tc' with basic metadata.",
  "sources": "Code reads static strings defining package metadata (name, version, author, email, description, classifiers).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or output to external systems occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data used solely for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, hidden code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' to specify package details. All data appears to be static, standard metadata. No input sources, no sinks, no dynamic execution, or obfuscated code present. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The description indicates a placeholder package, suggesting it's for initial setup or testing. There are no indications of malware or security risks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears benign and typical for package distribution.",
