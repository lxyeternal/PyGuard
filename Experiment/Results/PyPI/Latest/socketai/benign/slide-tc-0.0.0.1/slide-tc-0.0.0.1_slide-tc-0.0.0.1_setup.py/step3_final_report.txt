  "purpose": "A placeholder package configuration script using setuptools for Python packaging.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package name, version, author, author_email, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input, network calls, or file operations.",
  "flows": "None; static data used solely for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional version string '0.0.0.1' but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with static metadata. No dynamic code, input handling, or external interactions are present. The version string is unusual but harmless. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and clarity support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
