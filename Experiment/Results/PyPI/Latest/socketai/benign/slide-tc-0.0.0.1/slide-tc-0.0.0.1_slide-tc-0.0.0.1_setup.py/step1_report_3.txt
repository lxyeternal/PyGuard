  "purpose": "To define and configure the package metadata for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static code analysis; no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations; no untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code is configuration-only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an unusual version string '0.0.0.1', which is unconventional but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, author info (left blank), description, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, no input processing, and no suspicious patterns. The version string is atypical but harmless. Overall, the code is straightforward and intended for package configuration only.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal setup configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
