  "purpose": "Provides a utility to retrieve the local machine's IP address.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the network connection attempt to '114.114.114.114' over UDP.",
  "sinks": "Uses socket operations to determine the local IP address, no untrusted data is written or transmitted outside.",
  "flows": "Creates a UDP socket, connects to an external IP to determine local IP, then closes the socket.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses an external IP to determine local IP, which is a common technique.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine the machine's IP by connecting to a public DNS server via UDP, then retrieving the socket's local address. The method is standard and does not involve any malicious behavior. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. No obfuscation or malware patterns are detected. The code is straightforward and appears to be a simple utility function.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for obtaining the local IP address. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
