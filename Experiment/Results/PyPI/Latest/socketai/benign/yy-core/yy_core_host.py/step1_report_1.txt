  "purpose": "Utility class to retrieve the local machine's IP address.",
  "sources": "socket.socket() and s.connect() which initiate network connections to an external IP (114.114.114.114).",
  "sinks": "s.getsockname() which retrieves socket information, not a traditional sink, but related to network connection info.",
  "flows": "Socket connection to external server '114.114.114.114' then retrieving local socket info.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes a network connection to a public DNS server to determine local IP address, which is common but may be considered unusual if not documented; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a method to get the host's IP address by establishing a UDP socket connection to a well-known external server (114.114.114.114) and then retrieving the local socket address. This is a typical method for determining the machine's outward-facing IP. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration evident. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected. The try-except block suppresses errors silently, which is not ideal but not malicious. No external data or input flows that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for obtaining the local IP address. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage. It simply performs a network operation to determine the host's IP address, a common practice.",
