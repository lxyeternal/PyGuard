  "purpose": "Provide a utility class to retrieve the local machine's IP address.",
  "sources": "Reading the network socket connection to external IP ('114.114.114.114') to determine local IP.",
  "sinks": "socket connection used to determine local IP; no data is sent or received beyond socket creation.",
  "flows": "Socket connection to external IP used solely to get local network information; no untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials beyond a public DNS IP, which is benign in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a UDP socket and connects to a well-known public DNS server ('114.114.114.114') to determine the machine's IP address. It handles exceptions gracefully and ensures socket closure. No data is transmitted or received beyond obtaining the local IP. There are no signs of malicious activity or backdoors. The code appears standard for retrieving local IP in network programming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility to get the local IP address, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain suspicious behavior.",
