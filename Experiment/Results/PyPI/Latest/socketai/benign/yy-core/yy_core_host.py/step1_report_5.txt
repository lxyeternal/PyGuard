  "purpose": "Provides a helper method to retrieve the local machine's IP address",
  "sources": "Calls to socket.socket() and s.connect() to determine the local IP",
  "sinks": "s.getsockname()[0] to obtain local IP address",
  "flows": "socket connection to external IP ('114.114.114.114') -> get local socket name -> return IP",
  "anomalies": "Uses external IP to determine local IP, which is a common method, no hardcoded credentials or secrets. No malicious code or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a UDP socket and connects to an external IP address ('114.114.114.114') to determine the machine's outward-facing IP address. It handles exceptions gracefully and closes the socket properly. The approach is standard for retrieving local IP. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present; the code only performs network socket operations to obtain network information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for obtaining the local IP address. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It does not send data over the network beyond the initial connection attempt to determine the IP.",
