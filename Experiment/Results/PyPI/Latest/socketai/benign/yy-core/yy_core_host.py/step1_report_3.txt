  "purpose": "The code provides a utility class to retrieve the local machine's IP address by establishing a UDP socket connection to a public IP address.",
  "sources": "The socket connection to '114.114.114.114' on port 80 to determine local IP",
  "sinks": "The method returns the IP address; potential leakage if this data is misused, but no external sink is present in the code itself",
  "flows": "Socket connection to external server ('114.114.114.114') leads to retrieval of local IP address, which is then returned",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The socket connection is used solely for IP discovery, a common pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a method to determine the host's IP by creating a UDP socket and connecting to a public IP. It handles exceptions gracefully, ensuring socket closure. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident; it is a straightforward utility function. No external data is sent or received beyond the IP discovery process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard method for obtaining the local IP address with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
