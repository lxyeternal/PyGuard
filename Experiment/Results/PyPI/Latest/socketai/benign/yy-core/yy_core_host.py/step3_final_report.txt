  "purpose": "Retrieve the local machine's IP address by establishing a UDP connection to an external server.",
  "sources": "Socket creation and connection to '114.114.114.114' on port 80; retrieving socket's local address.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only local IP address retrieval without data leakage or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Socket connects to external IP -> retrieves local socket address -> returns IP.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling; no logging or error reporting, but no malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a standard technique to determine the outward-facing IP by connecting to a public DNS server. It performs no malicious actions, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. Exception handling is silent, which could be improved, but it does not impact security. The connection to an external server is typical for such utility functions and does not pose significant risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for obtaining the local IP address. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
