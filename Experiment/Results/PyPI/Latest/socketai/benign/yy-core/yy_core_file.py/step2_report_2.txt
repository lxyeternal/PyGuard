  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Functionality:** Helper classes for Alibaba OSS and Tencent COS, with standard methods for file upload, download, delete, list, and metadata retrieval.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Credentials are variables intended to be supplied externally; data flows through SDK calls; no suspicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Concerns:** Use of placeholders like '<yourObjectName>' in get_file_stream suggests incomplete code or templates, not malicious intent. Exception handling is broad but typical for SDK wrappers.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears straightforward, well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The low malware score (0) and high confidence (0.9) are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Functionality:** Similar helper classes for cloud storage operations, including upload/download/list.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Credentials are placeholders; no suspicious data flows; print statements are harmless.\n- **Anomalies & Concerns:** Placeholder '<yourObjectName>' again indicates incomplete code, not malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK wrapper, no malicious activity. Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Functionality:** Helper classes for Alibaba OSS and Tencent COS, with typical file management functions.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No hardcoded secrets; placeholder in get_file_stream; no obfuscation.\n- **Anomalies & Concerns:** Placeholder object name; no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward SDK wrapper, no signs of sabotage or malware.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Functionality:** Cloud storage helper classes for OSS and COS.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Credentials are empty strings, likely placeholders; no obfuscated code or malicious patterns.\n- **Anomalies & Concerns:** Placeholder credentials; broad exception handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical SDK wrapper, no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Functionality:** Similar cloud storage helper classes.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Placeholder empty credentials; no malicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Concerns:** No backdoors or obfuscation; placeholders suggest incomplete code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK wrappers, no malicious signals.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Intent & Behavior:** All reports describe code that wraps SDK calls for cloud storage services. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of malicious payloads.\n- **Credentials & Data Handling:** Credentials are placeholders, which is common in sample code or templates. No hardcoded secrets are present.\n- **Suspicious Indicators:** The only recurring anomaly is the use of placeholders like '<yourObjectName>' and empty credential variables, indicating incomplete or template code rather than malicious intent.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation Scores:** All are zero, consistent with the analysis that this is benign SDK wrapper code.\n- **Security Risks:** Low, primarily related to misconfiguration or insecure credential management outside this code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or code hiding)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (minimal, mainly due to placeholder credentials and incomplete code snippets)\n\n**Note:** If actual credentials are inserted insecurely or if placeholders are replaced with sensitive info in production, the risk increases. But based on the provided code snippets and reports, the overall security posture is low.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, straightforward SDK wrapper for Alibaba OSS and Tencent COS, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The placeholders suggest incomplete examples rather than malicious intent. The overall malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, with a low security risk score of around 0.2.",
