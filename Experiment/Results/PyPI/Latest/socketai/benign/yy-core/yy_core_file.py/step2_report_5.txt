  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Helper classes for Alibaba OSS and Tencent COS, performing standard file operations. Uses SDKs, with credentials supplied externally. No malicious behavior detected. Placeholders like '<yourObjectName>' suggest incomplete code, not malicious intent.\n\n- **Risks:** Credentials are not hardcoded; broad exception handling could obscure errors but not malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK wrappers, low suspicion.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar helper classes for cloud storage, straightforward SDK usage, with placeholders indicating incomplete code. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Risks:** Credentials placeholders, broad exception handling, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Standard cloud storage helpers, low security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, SDK wrappers for Alibaba OSS and Tencent COS, with standard operations. Placeholders like '<yourObjectName>' in get_file_stream suggest incomplete code.\n\n- **Risks:** No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** Routine SDK wrappers, no malicious signals.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar helper classes, standard SDK calls, no obfuscation or malicious patterns. Credentials are empty strings placeholders.\n\n- **Risks:** No suspicious behavior, broad exception handling, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Straightforward cloud storage helpers, low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, SDK wrappers with standard methods. No hardcoded secrets, placeholders used. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Risks:** No obfuscation, no malicious code, only placeholder credentials.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — suitable.\n\n**Conclusion:** Typical SDK wrappers, no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code nature:** All reports describe helper classes wrapping SDK functions for Alibaba OSS and Tencent COS. They perform standard file operations, metadata retrieval, listing, deletion, and multipart uploads.\n\n- **Potential concerns:** The only recurring issue is the use of placeholders (e.g., '<yourObjectName>') and empty credential variables, indicating incomplete code or templates, not malicious code.\n\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, dynamic code execution, or suspicious network activity. The code is straightforward, with no backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms.\n\n- **Security risk:** The overall security risk is low, primarily because the code is a utility wrapper, not an attack vector. The placeholders for credentials should be managed securely outside the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**             | **0.1–0.2** |\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor due to placeholders and broad exception handling, but overall low.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured SDK helper for cloud storage services with no malicious or sabotage elements. Proper management of credentials outside this code is essential, but the code itself appears safe.",
