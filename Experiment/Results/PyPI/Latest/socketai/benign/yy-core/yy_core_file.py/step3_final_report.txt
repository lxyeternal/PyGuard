{
  "purpose": "Helper classes providing SDK wrappers for Alibaba OSS and Tencent COS, facilitating file operations, metadata retrieval, listing, deletion, and multipart uploads.",
  "sources": "SDK method calls for file upload/download, metadata, listing; credentials supplied via constructor parameters; placeholders like '<yourObjectName>' indicating incomplete code.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from local files/streams into SDK calls; credentials and configuration data flow into SDK initialization; no suspicious data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (local files, streams) into SDK methods; credentials and configuration variables into SDK constructors; SDK responses used for file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling (`except: raise`), placeholders such as '<yourObjectName>' and empty credential strings, indicating incomplete or template code rather than malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK wrapper for cloud storage services, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or sabotage. The placeholders suggest incomplete examples or templates, not malicious activity. Credentials are not hardcoded; exception handling is broad but typical. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility wrappers for cloud SDKs. No malicious behavior or sabotage signals are detected. The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate, with a minimal security risk primarily due to placeholders and incomplete code snippets.",
