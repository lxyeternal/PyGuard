  "purpose": "Utility class for handling and converting date and time formats, timestamps, and calculating date ranges.",
  "sources": "Input data can come from user-provided format_time strings, timestamps, or date objects passed to various methods.",
  "sinks": "Methods convert or format input data; no untrusted data directly influences system state or outputs without user control.",
  "flows": "Input data (format_time, timestamps) flows into parsing/conversion functions which produce datetime objects, formatted strings, or timestamps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code provides comprehensive time and date utilities with standard use of Python's datetime, time, calendar, and dateutil.relativedelta modules. All operations are purely computational, with no data exfiltration, network activity, or insecure practices detected. Methods accept user input for date strings or timestamps and perform conversions or calculations locally, with no evident malicious intent. The code includes standard practices for date manipulation, and there are no hidden or obfuscated behaviors. No external calls or network connections are made. The code is well-structured and does not appear to contain malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility module for date/time manipulation with no signs of malicious behavior or security threats. It performs standard, benign operations typical for time handling libraries.",
