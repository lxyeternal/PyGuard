{
  "purpose": "Utility class providing various time-related conversions and calculations, such as formatting, timestamp conversion, date arithmetic, and date range checks.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters (format_time, timestamp, date, etc.), system time via datetime.datetime.now() and time.time().",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations. No network, file, or credential handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters or system time to output conversions, formatting, or calculations; no external data is written or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; functions perform standard date/time processing. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of dateutil.relativedelta is standard for date arithmetic.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises a comprehensive set of time utility functions, converting between formats, timestamps, and datetime objects, as well as calculating date differences and boundaries for weeks, months, and years. It relies solely on standard libraries and dateutil, with no evidence of malicious behavior. There are no network operations, no data leaks, nor any hidden behaviors. The code appears to be straightforward and well-structured, designed solely for date/time manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class for time calculations and formatting. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It performs standard operations without side effects or external communications.",
