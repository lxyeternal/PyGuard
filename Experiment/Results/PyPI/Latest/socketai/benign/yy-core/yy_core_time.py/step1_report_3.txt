{
  "purpose": "A utility class providing various date and time formatting, conversion, and calculation functions.",
  "sources": "User inputs for format_time, format, timestamps, and date strings; data from method parameters such as timestamps and date strings.",
  "sinks": "Conversions from untrusted user input data (strings, timestamps) to datetime objects or formatted strings; no direct data leaks or external calls.",
  "flows": "User input -> parsing/conversion functions -> formatted date/time outputs; no external network or system interactions observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected. Usage of standard libraries and external dateutil dependency appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs date/time conversions, formatting, and calculations using standard Python libraries. It handles different input types (strings, timestamps, datetime objects) securely. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No network calls, file access, or suspicious data handling present. The functions are straightforward utilities without malicious intent. The code does not access sensitive environment variables, system files, or perform any operations that could leak data or compromise security. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured utility for date and time manipulation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe for use in a broader application context.",
