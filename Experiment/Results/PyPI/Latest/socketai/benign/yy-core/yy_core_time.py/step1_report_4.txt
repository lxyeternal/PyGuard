{
  "purpose": "Utility class for handling and converting various date and time formats, providing methods for getting current times, converting between timestamps and formatted strings, and calculating date differences.",
  "sources": "Reads input from method parameters such as format_time, timestamp, date, or uses system functions like datetime.datetime.now() and time.time()",
  "sinks": "Converts data to datetime objects, formatted strings, or timestamps; no unsafe operations or external system interactions observed",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., format_time, timestamp) is parsed and converted into datetime objects or strings; calculations or formatting are performed; no data is sent to external systems or network endpoints",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected; functions perform standard date/time operations. No use of unsafe or dynamic code execution. The code contains extensive date/time utility functions only.",
  "analysis": "The code provides various methods for converting, formatting, and manipulating date and time data using standard Python libraries (time, datetime, calendar, dateutil). Input parameters are mostly from method arguments, with some defaults using current system time. There are no indications of external data fetching, network activity, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The methods perform straightforward calculations and conversions, aligned with typical date/time utility classes. The code appears well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard date/time utility class with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs common operations safely and does not exhibit malware characteristics or security vulnerabilities.",
