  "purpose": "A logging utility supporting file, console, and database storage with dynamic table creation and log management.",
  "sources": "Reads log data from application code, environment variables, and external helper modules.",
  "sinks": "Writes logs to files, console output, and various databases (MySQL, Redis, Clickhouse). Potential data leaks if sensitive info is logged.",
  "flows": "Log data flows from application through logger handlers to storage backends, with potential injection points in SQL commands.",
  "anomalies": "Uses string concatenation for SQL queries, risking injection; broad exception handling masks errors; 'raise' used with string instead of Exception object.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured logging framework with multiple handlers and dynamic database schema management. No malicious code or obfuscation detected. The main security concern is unsafe SQL query construction via string interpolation, which could be exploited if malicious log data is processed. Exception handling masks errors, which could hide issues but does not indicate malicious intent. External helper modules are assumed secure but are not provided for review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate logging utility with no active malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security issue is the unsafe SQL string formatting, which could lead to injection if log data is maliciously crafted. Overall, the code poses a moderate security risk primarily due to potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
