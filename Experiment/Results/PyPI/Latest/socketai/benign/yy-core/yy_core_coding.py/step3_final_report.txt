  "purpose": "Provides URL encoding and decoding functionalities using Python's standard library.",
  "sources": "Input strings passed to url_encode and url_decode methods.",
  "sinks": "Processed output returned; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow into urllib.parse.quote/unquote functions and return encoded/decoded strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard library functions with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple utility class with two class methods wrapping standard urllib.parse functions for URL encoding and decoding. It accepts input strings and optional encoding parameters, returning processed strings. There are no network calls, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (0 or very close to 0). The code's simplicity and use of standard library functions confirm its safety. Minor concerns about input handling do not constitute security risks in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for URL encoding and decoding, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate; the malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting its safe nature.",
