{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for URL encoding and decoding.",
  "sources": "User inputs or external data passed as the 'text' parameter to url_encode or url_decode methods.",
  "sinks": "The functions return encoded or decoded strings; potential data leaks if used improperly, but no direct data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'text' parameter into parse.quote or parse.unquote functions, then outputs returned as encoded/decoded strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward class methods wrapping urllib.parse functions for URL encoding/decoding. No external data sources or network operations are present. The implementation appears standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or data exfiltration. The only potential concern is if user input is maliciously crafted, but the functions themselves do not process data insecurely or perform unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility module for URL encoding and decoding with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
