  "purpose": "Provide URL encoding and decoding utilities for strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'text' and optional 'coding' in the url_encode and url_decode methods.",
  "sinks": "The parse.quote and parse.unquote functions process the input data for URL encoding/decoding.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' and 'coding' are passed to parse.quote or parse.unquote, which generate encoded or decoded strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. The code performs straightforward URL encoding/decoding.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper class with class methods for URL encoding and decoding using Python's urllib.parse functions. No input validation or sanitation is performed, but these functions are standard and safe for their purpose. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors are present. The code is simple and appears to be a utility module without external data fetches or network connections.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for URL encoding and decoding. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard, safe implementation.",
