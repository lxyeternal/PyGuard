  "purpose": "Provides URL encoding and decoding functions for handling string data.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the url_encode and url_decode methods.",
  "sinks": "Return statements output encoded/decoded strings; no other data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed via parse.quote and parse.unquote functions, returning results.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper class with methods for URL encoding and decoding, utilizing Python's standard urllib.parse functions. No external inputs are directly executed or processed insecurely. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The methods are straightforward, with parameters for input text and encoding, returning processed strings. No risky behavior or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple utility for URL encoding and decoding. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The functions rely on standard library methods without any dangerous operations.",
