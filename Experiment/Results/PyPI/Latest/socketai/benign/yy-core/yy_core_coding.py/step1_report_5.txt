  "purpose": "Provide URL encoding and decoding functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'text' for encoding/decoding functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions output encoded or decoded URL strings.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows into parse.quote/unquote functions, which process and return the URL-encoded or decoded string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, wrapping urllib.parse.quote and unquote methods for URL encoding and decoding. It accepts user-provided strings and returns processed URL strings. There are no input validation or sanitation mechanisms, but given the purpose, this is typical. No dangerous functions or obfuscation are present. The code is simple and clean, serving a utility purpose without any signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic URL encoding and decoding without any malicious or suspicious elements. It is a benign utility module with no evident security risks.",
