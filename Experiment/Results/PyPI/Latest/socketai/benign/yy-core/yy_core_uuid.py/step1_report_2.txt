  "purpose": "Provide a helper class to generate UUID4 strings.",
  "sources": "Import of uuid module and calling uuid.uuid4() within get_uuid() method.",
  "sinks": "The uuid.uuid4() function generates a UUID, which is returned as a string; no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "The code reads no external data; uuid.uuid4() generates a new UUID internally and returns it.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple helper class for UUID generation. It imports the uuid module and uses uuid.uuid4() to generate a UUID string. There are no inputs from external sources, no data leaks, and no malicious or suspicious operations. The class and method are standard and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and appears to serve a utility purpose for UUID generation without any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
