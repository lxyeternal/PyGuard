  "purpose": "Generate a UUID v4 string for identification purposes.",
  "sources": "Import of the uuid module and invocation of uuid.uuid4()",
  "sinks": "Return of the UUID string; no data sinks or external communication present",
  "flows": "Input (none) -> uuid.uuid4() -> return UUID string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports the uuid module and defines a helper class with a method to generate UUID v4 strings. The method simply calls uuid.uuid4() and returns its string representation. No external data input, environment variable access, or network activity occurs. The code appears to be straightforward and benign, used for generating unique identifiers. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple UUID generator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and serves a legitimate purpose.",
