{
  "purpose": "A CSV helper class for reading, writing, and manipulating CSV files, including creating, opening, inserting, deleting, and saving data.",
  "sources": "File input/output operations, reading data from CSV files, data assignment in methods such as set_cell, set_row, set_column, insert_row, insert_column.",
  "sinks": "File write operation in save(), data assignment in set_cell, set_row, set_column, insert_row, insert_column, and deletion methods; potential data manipulation points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input into __data_list via open(); data is modified through setters and insert/delete methods; final data is written back via save().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or hidden malicious code. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external network connections. The only notable activity is file handling with standard Python libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a CSV manipulation utility using standard Python libraries such as csv and os. It performs file creation, opening, reading, writing, and data manipulation with no evident malicious intent. The methods are typical for a CSV helper class and do not include network operations, system commands, or other typical malware behaviors. No suspicious patterns like hardcoded secrets or obfuscated logic are present. The only minor concern could be overwriting existing files during create(), but that is consistent with expected behavior for file management. Overall, the code appears to be a benign CSV utility without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CSV helper utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles file operations and data management in a typical manner. No evidence of malware or security threats was found.",
