  "purpose": "A CSV helper class for reading, writing, creating, and modifying CSV files with various utility functions.",
  "sources": "File reading operations in the 'open' and 'save' methods; input parameters for file names, data, and indices.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations in the 'create' and 'save' methods; data insertion/modification methods that alter internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Input data (file names, CSV data, indices) flow into methods; data is read from files and stored in internal lists; modifications are made and then written back to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. Usage of print statements for error reporting; no dynamic code execution or system command invocations found.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward CSV helper utility. It handles file operations securely with exception handling and standard Python libraries. No indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The data flow is contained within the local filesystem, with no external data or network operations. All functions relate to CSV data manipulation without any hidden or malicious logic. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or external payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CSV utility class with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily performs file I/O and data manipulation locally. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks.",
