{
  "purpose": "This code provides a CSV helper class for reading, writing, editing, and managing CSV files with standard file operations and data manipulation functions.",
  "sources": "File reading via open(), data input through input(), data modification via set_cell(), get_row(), get_column(), insert_row(), insert_column(), delete_row(), delete_column(), and save() methods.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to files during save() and export(); no untrusted data flows to network or system commands; no external sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input methods into internal data structures (__data_list), modifications via set_cell() or insert methods, and finally to file output in save() or export(). No suspicious source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The create() method deletes existing files without warning, which is standard but could be misused if misapplied, though not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CSV utility performing file I/O, data management, and formatting. It uses standard libraries with proper exception handling. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are detected. The only minor concern is the file deletion during creation, which is typical for overwrite behavior. The code is readable, well-structured, and performs expected functions without suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CSV helper utility with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects typical file handling behavior. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0, indicating a safe, standard library component.",
