  "purpose": "A helper class for managing CSV files including reading, writing, inserting, deleting, and modifying data within CSV files.",
  "sources": "File reading operations (open method), input file_name parameter, environment variables (indirectly via os.path and os.remove).",
  "sinks": "File write operations (save method), file creation, deletion, and overwriting.",
  "flows": "Input file_name -> open/create -> data processing methods (get/set/insert/delete) -> save -> file output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. The code performs standard CSV file handling. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution found. No data exfiltration or privacy violations are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a CSV helper class with methods for file creation, opening, reading, writing, and editing CSV data. It uses standard libraries (csv, os) with proper file handling and error checking. No indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data theft, or hidden backdoors are present. The code's flow is straightforward, primarily focusing on file I/O and list manipulation. It does not perform any suspicious operations or contain malicious payloads. The only potential concern could be if the methods are misused for overwriting or deleting files, but these are typical functions for file management. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CSV management utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for handling CSV data without executing any malicious actions.",
