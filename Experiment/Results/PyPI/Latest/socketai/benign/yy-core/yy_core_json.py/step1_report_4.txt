{
  "purpose": "Provides JSON serialization and deserialization helper classes with custom encoding for various data types.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken from parameters json_data, which can be any JSON-serializable object or dict.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the json.dumps() function which outputs a JSON string; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from json_dumps to json.dumps, which serializes the data into a JSON string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom JSON encoder (JsonEncoder) that handles datetime, date, bytes, decimal, set, and objects with __dict__. It then provides a helper class (JsonHelper) with a method json_dumps that serializes data using this custom encoder, with configurable ASCII and separators. The code is standard for JSON serialization with extended data types and contains no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign JSON helper utility for serializing various Python objects into JSON strings with custom formatting. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
