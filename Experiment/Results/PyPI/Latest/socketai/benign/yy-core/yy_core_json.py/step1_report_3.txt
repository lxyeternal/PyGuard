  "purpose": "Provides custom JSON serialization and helper functions for JSON conversion.",
  "sources": "Data inputs for JSON serialization via json_dumps method, including objects, datetime, bytes, decimal, and sets.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps function, which converts data into JSON string; potential exposure if untrusted data is processed and output.",
  "flows": "Input data → json_dumps method → json.dumps with custom encoder → JSON string output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and primarily utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom JSON encoder to handle datetime, bytes, decimal, set, and object instances, and a helper class to serialize JSON data into strings with specific formatting options. No input validation or network communication is present. It appears to be a standard utility module with no malicious behavior. The functions are safe, and the use of json.dumps with a custom encoder does not pose inherent security risks. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for JSON serialization with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It processes data locally for JSON conversion only.",
