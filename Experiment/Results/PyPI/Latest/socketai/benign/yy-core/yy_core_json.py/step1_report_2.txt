  "purpose": "Provide custom JSON encoding and decoding utilities, including serialization of datetime, decimal, bytes, and set objects.",
  "sources": "Input data for json_dumps method, which accepts json/dict data.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps function where data is serialized into a JSON string.",
  "flows": "Data flows from json_data parameter into json.dumps, possibly after being processed or containing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns. The custom encoder properly handles various data types without executing arbitrary code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom JSON encoder class that serializes datetime, date, bytes, decimal, set, and objects with __dict__ method. The JsonHelper class provides a class method json_dumps which serializes input data into a JSON string, with options for ASCII encoding and separators. There are no input/output operations involving external data sources, no code injection, and no suspicious code patterns. The code strictly performs data serialization with safe, well-understood Python libraries. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for JSON serialization, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
