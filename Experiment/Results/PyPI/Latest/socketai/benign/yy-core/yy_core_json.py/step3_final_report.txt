  "purpose": "A utility class for custom JSON serialization that handles various Python data types such as datetime, date, bytes, decimal, set, and objects with __dict__.",
  "sources": "The json_dumps method takes input data (json_data) for serialization.",
  "sinks": "The json_dumps method outputs a JSON string; no external sinks or data leaks are involved.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to json_dumps is processed through the custom JsonEncoder and returned as a JSON string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for JSON serialization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom JSON encoder to handle specific data types safely, then provides a helper method to serialize data with this encoder. It does not process untrusted input beyond serialization, nor does it perform network operations, dynamic code execution, or handle sensitive data. The code is purely utility-focused, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0, reflecting its safe and standard implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, utility class for JSON serialization with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
