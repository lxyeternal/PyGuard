  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure, and readable MySQL helper class with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor potential security concern regarding string formatting in get_transaction_sql does not constitute malicious behavior but warrants cautious use. Overall, the code's malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to potential misuse if inputs are not sanitized. The implementation aligns with best practices for database interaction in Python."
