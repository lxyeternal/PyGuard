      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no malicious intent. Report 2 indicates potential risk due to unsafe eval usage and hardcoded credentials, warranting a higher malware score. The scores are adjusted to reflect this, with malware at 0.6 and security risk at 0.8 for report 2. Other reports remain at zero or low scores. The overall assessment suggests low to moderate risk, emphasizing the need for further dynamic analysis of report 2's code."

      "conclusion": "All reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The absence of code results in zero risk and malware scores. Dynamic features are noted but do not elevate the risk to malicious levels. Overall, the supply chain security assessment is sound, with scores reflecting the benign nature of the code and the cautious approach to dynamic execution features."
