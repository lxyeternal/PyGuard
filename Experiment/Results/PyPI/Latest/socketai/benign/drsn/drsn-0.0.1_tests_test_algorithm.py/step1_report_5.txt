  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but the specific intent cannot be definitively determined without more context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or imported modules; specific source points are not explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution functions; however, no explicit dangerous sinks are identified in the visible code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources or variables through processing functions toward output or storage points; no suspicious source-to-sink flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined at multiple points, including import statements, data handling functions, and potential external communication. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors were identified. The use of third-party libraries appears typical, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden behavior. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or external connections are visible. Overall, the code seems benign with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard and safe. Confidence in this assessment is high, and there are no indications of obfuscation or malware.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
