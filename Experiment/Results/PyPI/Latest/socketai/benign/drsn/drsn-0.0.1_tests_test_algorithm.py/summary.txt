  "conclusion": "All reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The absence of code results in zero risk and malware scores. Dynamic features are noted but do not elevate the risk to malicious levels. Overall, the supply chain security assessment is sound, with scores reflecting the benign nature of the code and the cautious approach to dynamic execution features."
