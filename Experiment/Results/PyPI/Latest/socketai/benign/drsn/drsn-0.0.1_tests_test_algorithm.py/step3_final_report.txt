  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of a Python dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code inputs, environment variables, network calls, dynamic execution points (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, data leaks, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, possibly via dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec without sanitization, hardcoded secrets, unusual control flow, obfuscation patterns, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is absent in all reports, leading to straightforward zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk. When code is present, assessments correctly identify benign behavior, with minor concerns due to dynamic features like eval/exec, which are flagged but not deemed malicious. Scores are consistent with the evidence, with low malware and obfuscation scores and low security risk scores (0 or near 0), justified by the lack of malicious indicators. Confidence levels are high where analysis is thorough. No false positives or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The absence of code results in zero risk and malware scores. Dynamic features are noted but do not elevate the risk to malicious levels. Overall, the supply chain security assessment is sound, with scores reflecting the benign nature of the code and the cautious approach to dynamic execution features.",
