{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing and possibly interacts with external resources, though specific details are not provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and possibly from external files or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to files, output functions, and network connections; sensitive information might be transmitted or stored.",
  "flows": "Data from sources such as user input or environment variables flows through processing functions and may reach sinks like network calls or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. No hidden or malicious logic evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard input handling, data processing, and output routines. No suspicious functions, such as dynamic execution, network connections to unknown hosts, or data exfiltration methods, are observed. The absence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads suggests benign behavior. The code's structure indicates typical application logic rather than malicious or obfuscated intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears to be standard, benign Python code with no suspicious activities detected.",
