  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, network activity, eval()/exec() calls, hardcoded IPs/domains, variable names.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, dynamic code execution, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., network, eval()) to sinks (network transmission, file writes).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IPs/domains, eval()/exec(), obfuscated variable names, suspicious network activity, dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of malicious intent in reports 3 and 5, with indicators such as hardcoded malicious domains, eval()/exec(), and obfuscation. Reports 1, 2, and 4 lack code or suspicious features, justifying zero scores. Report 3's high malware (0.7) and risk (0.8) are justified; obfuscation (0.2) is moderate. Report 5's obfuscation (0.7) is high, with malware suspicion at 0.4, which could be slightly increased given the indicators. Overall, the scores align with the evidence, with minor adjustments suggested for reports 3 and 5 to better reflect suspicion levels.",
  "conclusion": "The provided scores are generally appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Slightly increasing malware scores for reports 3 and 5 could better capture their suspicious features, but current scores are acceptable. No major issues detected.",
