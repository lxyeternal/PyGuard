  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no malicious intent. Report 2 indicates potential risk due to unsafe eval usage and hardcoded credentials, warranting a higher malware score. The scores are adjusted to reflect this, with malware at 0.6 and security risk at 0.8 for report 2. Other reports remain at zero or low scores. The overall assessment suggests low to moderate risk, emphasizing the need for further dynamic analysis of report 2's code."
