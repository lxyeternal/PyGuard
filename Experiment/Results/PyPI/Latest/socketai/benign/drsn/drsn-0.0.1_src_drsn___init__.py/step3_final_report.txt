  "purpose": "Analysis of Python code for malicious behavior, security risks, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include data read from files, network, environment variables, or user input (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include code execution functions (like eval), network communication, file modifications, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., untrusted input) to sinks (e.g., eval, network calls) via code execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval with unvalidated input, hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns not confirmed as malicious but flagged as red flags.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious payloads in benign reports. Report 2 highlights use of eval and hardcoded strings, which are red flags. The scores assigned are generally consistent with the described behavior. Slightly elevated malware and risk scores for report 2 are justified due to potential code injection vectors. Other reports show no issues, with low scores. Overall, the assessment aligns with the evidence, but for report 2, a higher malware score (around 0.6) is appropriate if eval is used with untrusted data. The overall security risk remains moderate, driven mainly by report 2's patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no malicious intent. Report 2 indicates potential risk due to unsafe eval usage and hardcoded credentials, warranting a higher malware score. The scores are adjusted to reflect this, with malware at 0.6 and security risk at 0.8 for report 2. Other reports remain at zero or low scores. The overall assessment suggests low to moderate risk, emphasizing the need for further dynamic analysis of report 2's code.",
