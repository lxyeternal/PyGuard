  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'notoken887' Python library.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup parameters (name, version, author, description, url, classifiers).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A – static setup configuration without data flow or user input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') which are unusual and potentially malicious or unprofessional; no obfuscation or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup configuration with no dynamic or suspicious code execution. The author email and URL are unconventional and could be indicative of malicious intent or at least unprofessional behavior. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, code injection, or malicious payloads. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with some unusual contact information but no malicious code or security risks identified. The likelihood of malicious intent based on this code alone is very low.",
