  "analysis": "Insufficient details of the code prevent a comprehensive analysis. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident from the current fragment. Further review of the actual code content is needed for definitive conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the lack of visible code and suspicious features, there are no clear indications of malicious behavior. However, due to incomplete information, confidence remains low.",
