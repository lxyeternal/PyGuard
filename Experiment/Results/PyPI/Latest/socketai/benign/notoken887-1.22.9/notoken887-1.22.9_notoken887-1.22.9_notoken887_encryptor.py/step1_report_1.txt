  "purpose": "The class provides simple obfuscation methods for encrypting and decrypting strings by replacing specific characters with symbols and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input to the encrypt() and decrypt() methods via string arguments.",
  "sinks": "The output of encrypt() and decrypt() methods; potentially used elsewhere in code.",
  "flows": "Input string -> encrypt() (character replacements) -> output; Encrypted string -> decrypt() (reverse replacements) -> original string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior; the character replacement is straightforward and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements simple character substitution for obfuscation. It does not perform any network activity, file access, or data exfiltration. No input validation or security-sensitive operations are present. The methods are purely for encoding/decoding strings using fixed character mappings. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for string obfuscation with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
