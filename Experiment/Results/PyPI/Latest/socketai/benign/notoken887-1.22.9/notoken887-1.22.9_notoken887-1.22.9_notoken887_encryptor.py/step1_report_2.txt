  "purpose": "Simple character substitution cipher for obfuscating and de-obfuscating strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "Returned strings after substitution; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace characters -> output encrypted/decrypted string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of character replacement for encryption is insecure; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected; no suspicious external calls or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic substitution cipher using character replacements. It does not perform any network operations, file access, or external data handling. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic is present. The encryption is trivial and insecure but not malicious. No obfuscation or malware indicators are found. The code appears straightforward and intended for simple string obfuscation, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple, insecure character substitution cipher intended for obfuscation purposes only. No malicious intent is evident.",
