{
  "purpose": "The class provides basic reversible obfuscation of strings using character replacement, possibly for simple encoding or obscuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Input string to encrypt() and encrypted_token to decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "Returns from encrypt() and decrypt() methods; no external data sinks or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace 'M' with '∩', 'A' with '◙', 'x' with '卐' in encrypt() -> output encrypted string -> decrypt() reverses the replacements -> output original string.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward character substitution; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple reversible character substitution cipher, replacing specific characters with symbols and vice versa. There are no sources of untrusted data beyond method inputs. No external data sinks, network activity, or malicious actions are present. The code appears to be intended for simple obfuscation rather than security or malicious purposes. No signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected. The logic is straightforward and easy to interpret. It does not utilize any complex or obfuscated language features.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic reversible string obfuscation with no malicious intent, malware, or security risks detected. It appears to serve a benign purpose of simple encoding.",
