{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution-based encryption and decryption for strings, likely intended for obfuscation or basic data transformation.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, specifically the 'string' and 'encrypted_token' parameters.",
  "sinks": "The methods output the transformed string, which could be used elsewhere in the application. No direct sinks involving network, file, or environment interaction are present within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Input 'string' flows through the 'encrypt' method, being transformed by character replacements; similarly, 'encrypted_token' flows through the 'decrypt' method with reverse replacements.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs simple character substitutions without involving external data sources, cryptographic libraries, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The class defines straightforward methods for replacing specific characters with symbols and vice versa. There are no external data sources, no input validation, no cryptographic operations, and no external network or system interactions. The code appears to be a basic obfuscation or encoding utility, not malware or a security risk. The simplicity suggests intended obfuscation rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for character substitution-based encoding and does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks based on its content. It does not contain malware, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious operations.",
