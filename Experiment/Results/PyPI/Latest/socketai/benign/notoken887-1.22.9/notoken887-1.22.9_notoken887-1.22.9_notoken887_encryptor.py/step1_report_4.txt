{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution-based encryption and decryption methods for strings, likely for obscuring data.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "Return values of encrypt and decrypt methods; potential use in larger workflows.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace 'M'/'A'/'x' -> encrypted string -> replace back for decryption.",
  "anomalies": "Uses straightforward string replacements without any cryptographic security; no external data or secrets involved.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic character substitution cipher, which is not secure cryptography. There are no sources of untrusted input beyond method parameters, and no data leaks or malicious actions are evident. The methods only perform static replacements without side effects or external communications. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The logic is simple and transparent, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a trivial substitution cipher for string obfuscation. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It presents minimal security risk but offers no real security benefit. No vulnerabilities or malicious activities are detected.",
