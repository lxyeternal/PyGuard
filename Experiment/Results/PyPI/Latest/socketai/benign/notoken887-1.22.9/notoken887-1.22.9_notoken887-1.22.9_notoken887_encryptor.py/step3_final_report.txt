{
  "purpose": "A simple reversible character substitution utility for obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "The methods read input strings to perform replacements; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data into external systems; the replacements are internal string operations with no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed by 'encrypt' or 'decrypt' methods, with character replacements occurring within the string; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward, static character replacements with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The class 'TokenCryptor' performs simple, static character substitutions for 'M', 'A', and 'x' to obfuscate strings. The 'encrypt' method replaces these characters with Unicode symbols, and 'decrypt' reverses the process. There are no external data sources, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded credentials. The operations are transparent and easily reversible. The code does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The obfuscation is minimal, just character substitution, so the obfuscated score is 0.1, and the security risk score is also 0.1, acknowledging the trivial obfuscation but no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward string obfuscator using simple character replacements. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No further adjustments are necessary.",
