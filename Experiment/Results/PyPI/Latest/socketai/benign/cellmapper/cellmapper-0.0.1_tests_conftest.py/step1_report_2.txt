{
  "purpose": "The code sets up fixtures for testing a biological data analysis pipeline involving cell mapping, clustering, and gene expression data processing.",
  "sources": "Data is read from a CSV file (precomputed_leiden fixture) and datasets from the scanpy library; numpy arrays are created internally.",
  "sinks": "Data is loaded and processed within the Python environment; no untrusted data sinks are evident. No data is sent over the network or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data is read from files and datasets, processed with numpy, pandas, and scanpy functions, and passed into objects and functions for clustering and mapping. No external or untrusted data flows are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code appears straightforward, mainly setting up test data and fixtures.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads datasets, creates test fixtures, and sets up objects for testing the cellmapper module. It reads from a CSV file within the 'tests.data' package, but this is standard testing setup. All operations are typical data processing steps, with no suspicious code, malicious commands, or secret extraction. No network activity, file manipulation beyond reading test data, or other malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test setup for biological data analysis workflows. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The observed code is safe and intended for testing purposes.",
