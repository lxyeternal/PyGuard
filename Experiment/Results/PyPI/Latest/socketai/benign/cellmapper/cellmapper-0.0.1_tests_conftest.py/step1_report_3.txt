{
  "purpose": "The code defines test fixtures for unit testing a cell mapping application using scanpy and related libraries, including data setup, normalization, clustering, and a CellMapper object.",
  "sources": "File read from 'tests.data/precomputed_leiden.csv' using pd.read_csv().",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that execute untrusted input or data that could lead to security issues. No network connections or file modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data read from a CSV file flows into pandas DataFrame, which is then used within the testing fixtures. No data flows into untrusted sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors, such as obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious variable names. The code uses standard data processing and testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up fixtures for unit testing with synthetic and real datasets, performs standard preprocessing, and constructs a CellMapper object. The only external resource accessed is a CSV file loaded via pandas, which appears to be a benign fixture file. No hardcoded secrets, network activities, or system modifications are detected. The overall structure and methods are typical for testing machine learning/data analysis pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test setup for a cell mapping application with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It safely loads test data, performs normal processing, and creates objects without executing untrusted code or exposing sensitive data.",
