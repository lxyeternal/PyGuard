{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to set up fixtures for testing a cell mapping analysis pipeline, including data loading, preprocessing, and preparation for downstream analysis with the CellMapper class.",
  "sources": "Data is read from local CSV files (`precomputed_leiden.csv`) via `pd.read_csv`. Other data is generated in-memory, including NumPy arrays and synthetic data. No untrusted input sources like user input or network data are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous functions or systems. The code primarily reads files and manipulates data in-memory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input (`pd.read_csv`) into pandas DataFrames, then into variables used to instantiate objects. No untrusted data flows into system commands, network calls, or other sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code uses standard data processing libraries (numpy, pandas, scanpy) with straightforward data handling. No hardcoded credentials or unusual logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of fixture functions for unit testing, including data creation, data loading, and object instantiation for testing purposes. It reads a CSV file for precomputed clustering results, which is a typical testing fixture. The rest of the code generates synthetic datasets and sets up a CellMapper object with typical preprocessing steps. There is no code execution, network activity, or other potentially malicious behavior. Usage of standard libraries and file reading appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for setting up test fixtures for a data analysis pipeline. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It uses standard libraries and safe file operations. Therefore, the overall security risk is negligible.",
