  "purpose": "Setup pytest fixtures for testing a cell mapping pipeline, involving data loading, normalization, and clustering.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files from package data (e.g., 'precomputed_leiden.csv') and datasets via scanpy.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sinks; all data processing is internal and controlled.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads into pandas DataFrame, then into fixtures for dataset setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard testing setup code, loading datasets and precomputed results in a straightforward manner. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The use of package data files and standard scientific libraries indicates a benign environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect minimal risk, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The risk score can be set to approximately 0.1 to account for reading external fixture files, which is typical in testing environments.",
