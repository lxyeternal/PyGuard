  "purpose": "The code patches the Sphinx NumpyDocstring class to customize the parsing and formatting of the :returns: section in docstrings, transforming parameter annotations into a specific format.",
  "sources": "The lines of the docstring's :returns: section, accessed via self._consume_to_next_section()",
  "sinks": "None; the code only processes string data without external data flow or system interaction",
  "flows": "Lines from the docstring's returns section are processed by _process_return, then reformatted and returned by _parse_returns_section",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward regex parsing and method patching; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code overrides a class method to reformat return annotations in docstrings, using regex to parse parameter and type info, then replacing the original method. It operates solely on string data, with no external calls or data leaks. The approach is standard for extending Sphinx documentation behavior. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The regex assumes a specific format but is typical for docstring processing. The code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard patch to customize Sphinx's docstring parsing. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware and low for security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
