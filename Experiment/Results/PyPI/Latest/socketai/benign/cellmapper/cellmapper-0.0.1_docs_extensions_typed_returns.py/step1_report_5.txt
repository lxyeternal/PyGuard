{
  "purpose": "This code customizes the parsing of the ':returns:' section in numpy-style docstrings for Sphinx documentation generation.",
  "sources": "The code reads docstring lines from the '_consume_to_next_section()' method and the 'lines_raw' variable.",
  "sinks": "The code formats the processed lines for output in the documentation; no untrusted data is sent to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input lines from docstrings are processed by '_process_return', then passed to '_format_block' for formatting, and ultimately used to override a Sphinx method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The use of regex for parsing is standard. The code modifies existing Sphinx methods but does not introduce external or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and specific Sphinx components. It defines a helper generator '_process_return' to transform return annotations into reStructuredText format. The '_parse_returns_section' function modifies the default Sphinx behavior to customize how return sections are parsed, using the helper function. The 'setup' function replaces the original '_parse_returns_section' method with the custom implementation. All operations are straightforward string processing and method overriding without external data or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign modification of Sphinx documentation processing, aimed at customizing return documentation formatting. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
