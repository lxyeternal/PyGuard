  "purpose": "Modify the parsing method of NumpyDocstring in Sphinx to customize the handling of the returns section in documentation.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from docstring lines processed by the functions, specifically the lines of the ':returns:' section in documentation strings.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no data is written to external systems or files, and no untrusted data handling occurs beyond standard string processing.",
  "flows": "Lines from the documentation string are processed by _process_return to reformat parameter descriptions, then used by _parse_returns_section to generate formatted output. The modified method replaces the original class method.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs dynamic patching of a class method without validation, but this is a common pattern for extending or customizing library behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for regular expressions and type annotations, then defines helper functions to process docstring sections, specifically the ':returns:' section. _process_return uses regex to identify parameter types and formats them accordingly. _parse_returns_section extracts, processes, and reformats these lines. The setup function replaces an internal class method with a custom implementation, which is a standard way to extend or override library behavior. The code appears to focus solely on documentation string formatting without any network or system interaction. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign customization of the Sphinx documentation generator, aimed at altering the output format of docstring return sections. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
