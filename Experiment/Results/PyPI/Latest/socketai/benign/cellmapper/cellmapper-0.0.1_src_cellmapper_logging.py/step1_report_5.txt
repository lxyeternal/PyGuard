  "purpose": "Setup logging configuration for the package using Rich library for enhanced console output.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get('LOGLEVEL') to determine log level, imported modules (logging, os, rich.console.Console, rich.logging.RichHandler).",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data directly, but the environment variable LOGLEVEL influences logging behavior.",
  "flows": "Environment variable LOGLEVEL influences logger.setLevel; logger outputs logs to console via RichHandler.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses environment variable for log level and standard logging setup. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger with a rich console handler, setting the log level based on an environment variable. It includes an unnecessary check 'if console.is_jupyter is True' which is benign but slightly unusual. No data leaks, malicious commands, or suspicious behavior are present. The environment variable influences the log level, which could be misconfigured but is standard practice. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard logging setup for enhanced console output, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears safe and purpose-driven for debugging or informational logging.",
