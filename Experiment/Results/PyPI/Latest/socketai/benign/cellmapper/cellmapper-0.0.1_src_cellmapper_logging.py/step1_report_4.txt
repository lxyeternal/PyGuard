  "anomalies": "None detected; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger with settings based on an environment variable, using the rich library for enhanced output formatting. It includes a check for Jupyter environments and sets logging levels accordingly. No external or untrusted data sources, no code injection, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The environment variable is used in a safe manner, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended for logging setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
