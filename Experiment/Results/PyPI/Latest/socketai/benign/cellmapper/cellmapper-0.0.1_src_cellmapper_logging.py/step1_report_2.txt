{
  "purpose": "Configure logging for the package using the 'rich' library for enhanced output formatting.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOGLEVEL' for setting log level; import statements for 'rich.console' and 'rich.logging'.",
  "targets": "Logging output via RichHandler, which affects how logs are displayed in the terminal or notebook environment.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'LOGLEVEL' is read to set log level; logger configured with RichHandler; output is managed by 'rich' components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or malicious code found. The code uses standard logging setup with external library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard logging and os modules, then defines a function to set up a logger with rich formatting. It reads an environment variable 'LOGLEVEL' to set the logging level, defaulting to INFO. It initializes a 'rich' console and configures a RichHandler for the logger, adjusting display options based on the environment. The setup appears typical for advanced logging and does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No external data sources or sinks are involved beyond standard logging functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward logging setup using the 'rich' library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It enhances log presentation without introducing vulnerabilities.",
