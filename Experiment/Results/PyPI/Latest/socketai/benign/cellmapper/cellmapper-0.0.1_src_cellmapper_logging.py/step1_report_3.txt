  "purpose": "Set up logging configuration for the package using rich library for enhanced output formatting.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOGLEVEL' for logging level; import statements for logging and os modules; local variables in _setup_logger function.",
  "sinks": "Logging output directed to RichHandler which outputs to the console; no untrusted data sinks explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'LOGLEVEL' influences logger level; logger outputs to console via RichHandler.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; usage of environment variable for log level is standard but could potentially be misconfigured, though not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code configures a logger with RichHandler for styled console output, adjusting the level based on an environment variable. It contains standard practices such as disabling propagation to avoid duplicate logs. The use of 'rich' library is typical for enhanced logs. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are present. No dynamic code execution or data leaks observed. The code appears to be straightforward logging setup with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup using the 'rich' library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures the logger with environment-driven log level and console output styling.",
