  "purpose": "Set up logging configuration for the package using the 'rich' library for enhanced console output.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOGLEVEL' for logging level; import statements for 'rich.console.Console' and 'rich.logging.RichHandler'.",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers that output to the console; environment variable affecting logging level.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'LOGLEVEL' influences logger level; logger outputs to console via RichHandler.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code dynamically sets logging level based on environment variable without validation, which is typical but should be noted.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and os modules, then defines a function '_setup_logger' that initializes a logger using the 'rich' library for better console output. It retrieves the logging level from the environment variable 'LOGLEVEL', defaulting to INFO. The code creates a Console object and adjusts its 'is_jupyter' attribute. It sets up a RichHandler with specific display options, adds it to the logger, and prevents double logging by setting 'propagate' to False. The logger is then initialized and configured. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The only minor concern is the use of an environment variable for log level without validation, but this is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely configures a logger with the 'rich' library for enhanced output, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It performs typical setup routines without risks of malware or security issues.",
