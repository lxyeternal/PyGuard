{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the NeighborsResults class in the cellmapper.knn module, verifying functionality and error handling.",
  "sources": "Sample data inputs: sample_distances, sample_indices (likely fixtures or mock data); usage of imported libraries (numpy, pytest, scipy.sparse).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data leak points. No network, file, or system modification calls observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (sample_distances, sample_indices) flows into NeighborsResults constructor and methods, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code strictly appears to perform standard unit testing for a class.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical unit tests using pytest for the NeighborsResults class, including checks for correct shape, error handling, and correct output types. It does not contain any code that executes external commands, network operations, or data collection. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward test assertions suggest benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of standard unit tests for a Python class, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected testing actions without any suspicious or malicious code. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
