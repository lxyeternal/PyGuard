  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign Sphinx configuration file with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor potential risk relates to the trustworthiness of local extensions, which is manageable in controlled environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is appropriate due to extension loading practices."
