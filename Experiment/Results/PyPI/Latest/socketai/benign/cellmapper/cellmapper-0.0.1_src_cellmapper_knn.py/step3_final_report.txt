  "purpose": "Provides neighbor search computations and constructs adjacency/connectivity matrices for data analysis workflows, supporting multiple algorithms and kernels.",
  "sources": "Neighbor index arrays, distance matrices, and input datasets (xrep, yrep).",
  "sinks": "Sparse matrices representing neighbor relationships; potential downstream use in graph-based analyses.",
  "flows": "Input datasets -> neighbor search algorithms -> neighbor indices and distances -> adjacency/connectivity matrices.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard neighbor search procedures using well-known libraries (sklearn, pynndescent, faiss, rapids). It constructs sparse matrices for distances, connectivities, and adjacency, which are typical in graph-based data analysis. No network activity, file I/O, or external command execution is present. The logic is straightforward, with dependency checks and GPU acceleration options. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, low security risk 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for neighbor graph construction in scientific workflows. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behaviors are evident. The current security and malware scores are appropriate and justified.",
