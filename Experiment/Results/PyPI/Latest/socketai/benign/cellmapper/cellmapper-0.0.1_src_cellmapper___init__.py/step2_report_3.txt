  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports `version` from `importlib.metadata`.\n- It imports `CellMapper` and `logger` from local modules.\n- It defines `__all__` to expose `logger` and `CellMapper`.\n- It assigns `__version__` by retrieving the package version for \"cellmapper\".\n\n**Security Aspects:**\n- The code performs standard package initialization tasks.\n- No user input, network communication, or external data handling occurs.\n- The version retrieval is from package metadata, a common and safe practice.\n- There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.\n\n**Review of the Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n- They correctly identify no anomalies, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), and the malware and obfuscated scores are 0 across all reports.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is appropriate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity or code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 is appropriate; no evident vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- The only aspect to consider is the retrieval of package version via `importlib.metadata.version(\"cellmapper\")`. While standard, if the package name does not match the distribution name, it could raise an exception. However, this is a common pattern and unlikely to be malicious.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a typical package initialization script.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat. The reports' assessments are accurate and align with my analysis.",
