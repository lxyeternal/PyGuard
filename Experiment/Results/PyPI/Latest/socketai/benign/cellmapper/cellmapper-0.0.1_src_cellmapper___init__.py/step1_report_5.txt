{
  "purpose": "This module imports specific components and exposes them for external use, primarily related to cell mapping and logging.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using importlib.metadata and imports local modules 'cellmapper' and 'logging'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the version is retrieved but not used for malicious purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The use of __version__ is standard and does not pose a risk.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing standard library components and local modules, then setting module exports. The version retrieval is a common practice for package versioning. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a typical module initializer, exposing components and retrieving package version information.",
