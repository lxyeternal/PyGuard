{
  "purpose": "To define module metadata, import necessary classes and functions, and specify exports for the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata via importlib.metadata.version and imports local modules .cellmapper and .logging.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code primarily sets up module attributes and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info from the package metadata, imports local modules, and defines exported symbols. It appears to be a standard module setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious activity. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard initialization and metadata assignment with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
