  "purpose": "Initialize package metadata and expose core components for the 'cellmapper' package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'version' from 'importlib.metadata'; reading package metadata for version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communication or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Retrieving package version flows from 'importlib.metadata.version' to '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and assignment statements, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package initialization: importing version info, importing local modules, defining exports, and setting the package version. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The code is clear, simple, and follows best practices. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are detected. The version retrieval is a common pattern, and the code's structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
