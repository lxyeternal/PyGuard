{
  "purpose": "This code appears to initialize a Python package module by importing specific components and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata via importlib.metadata and imports local modules 'cellmapper' and 'logging'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no user input, network, or file outputs are directly involved.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves the package version, which is a read operation, and defines exports for other modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The version retrieval is standard for package info.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, exposes certain symbols, and retrieves the package version. All actions are standard for a Python package's __init__.py file. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code does not perform any data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. No anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely sets up module exports and reads package metadata in a conventional manner.",
