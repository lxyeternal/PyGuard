{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules and defines package metadata, specifically the version, logger, and CellMapper class, for a Python package named 'cellmapper'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from importlib.metadata to retrieve package version; local module imports (.cellmapper, .logging); __version__ assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The package version is retrieved and stored; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The version retrieval from package metadata is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and assigns the package version. It references the package name 'cellmapper' for version retrieval, which is typical in Python packaging. The logger and CellMapper are likely used elsewhere in the package. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No external data transmission, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a Python package's __init__.py or main module, establishing version info and exposing key components. No malicious or security risks are identified in this snippet.",
