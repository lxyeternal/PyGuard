{
  "purpose": "Define module metadata, import classes and logger, and expose certain objects.",
  "sources": "Import statement for package version, local module imports for CellMapper and logger.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only sets up imports and module metadata, no data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version number from importlib.metadata, which is standard for obtaining package version info. It imports classes and a logger from local modules, and defines the __all__ list for exports. The __version__ variable dynamically fetches the package version, which is common practice. There are no functions, input/output handling, or any network or file operations that could pose security issues. Overall, the code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python module setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard imports, exposes module components, and retrieves package version info securely. No anomalies or malicious activities are detected.",
