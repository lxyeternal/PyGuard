  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code imports `version` from `importlib.metadata`, then imports `CellMapper` and `logger` from local modules, and assigns `__version__` by retrieving the package version with the name \"cellmapper\".\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard Python package initialization patterns.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n   - No external data transmission, user input handling, or dynamic code execution is present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Reports:**\n   - All reports concur that the code is standard, with no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that the code performs package setup tasks: importing modules, defining exports, and retrieving version info.\n   - No untrusted data flows, external data sinks, or vulnerabilities are identified.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, as there are no security concerns.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The code is very simple and standard; no reason exists to adjust scores.\n   - No assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is accurate.\n   - The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is benign, with no security issues.\n   - The scores reflect this accurately.\n   - No further action or adjustment needed.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and the lack of any suspicious or malicious activity.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical package initialization script, performing safe imports and metadata retrieval. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
