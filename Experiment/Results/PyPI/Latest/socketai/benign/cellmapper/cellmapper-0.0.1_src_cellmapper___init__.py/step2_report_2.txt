  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the reported issues against the code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `version` from `importlib.metadata`.\n- Imports local modules `.cellmapper` and `.logging`.\n- Defines `__all__` with `\"logger\"` and `\"CellMapper\"`.\n- Sets `__version__` by calling `version(\"cellmapper\")`.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Issue Presence Check**\n\n**Are there any issues in the code?**\n\n- **Version retrieval:** Standard practice, no problems.\n- **Imports:** Straightforward, no untrusted data or external communication.\n- **Exports:** Properly defined.\n- **Malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies:** None detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n- No mention of actual vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The logic in the reports aligns with the code.\n\n**No significant errors or flaws in the reports.**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Score Justifications & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`. This is correct; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign `0`. Correct; no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign `0`. Appropriate; no security risk detected.\n\n**Scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.**\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Risk Score Justification**\n\n- The overall risk is minimal; the code is standard package setup.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The retrieval of version info is safe and common.\n\n**Therefore, the risk score should remain at 0.**\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Challenging Assumptions**\n\n- The reports assume that because the code is simple and standard, there's no malicious intent.\n- This is correct; no assumptions about hidden malicious code are warranted here.\n- No evidence of backdoors, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Score Consistency & Final Estimation**\n\n- The provided scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- Given the code's simplicity and the lack of any suspicious activity, I agree with the current scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n| Metric          | Score | Justification |\n|-----------------|--------|---------------|\n| Malware         | 0      | No malicious behavior detected. |\n| Obfuscated     | 0      | Clear, straightforward code. |\n| Risk            | 0      | No security risks identified. |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard module initialization script for a Python package.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activities are present.\n- The current scores reflect the code's safety accurately.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are.
