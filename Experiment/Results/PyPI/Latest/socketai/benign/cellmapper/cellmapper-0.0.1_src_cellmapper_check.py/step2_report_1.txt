  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code performs dependency checks via dynamic importlib.import_module calls based on dependency names.\n- Version parsing and comparison are straightforward.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident.\n- The main concern is the use of dynamic imports based on dependency names, which could be risky if inputs are untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, standard dependency checker.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as safe; no issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Standard dependency check, no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Correctly assesses safety.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (slightly higher, perhaps due to dynamic import concern)\n- **Analysis:** The only minor concern is dynamic import based on dependency names, but in this context, inputs are controlled.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative, but acceptable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Recognizes potential risk if dependency names are untrusted.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the potential risk of dynamic import if inputs are untrusted, but no malicious activity is present.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Highlights the risk of dynamic import if inputs are malicious, but no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** Correctly points out the potential security concern but notes no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the actual code behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting the potential risk of dynamic import with untrusted input but no actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code's core logic is straightforward, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n- The main security concern is the use of dynamic importlib.import_module with dependency names, which could be exploited if dependency names are externally controlled. However, in this code, dependency names are either hardcoded or controlled via parameters, and the reports recognize this.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code present)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (to reflect the potential risk of dynamic import if inputs are untrusted, but not a direct vulnerability)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is safe, with a minor caveat regarding dynamic imports, which is well-understood and documented. No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.",
