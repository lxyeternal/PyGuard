  "purpose": "To check the availability and version compliance of specified Python dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements (importlib, types, packaging.version.parse, version), class initializations, method calls (importlib.import_module, version), and attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module (potentially dynamic module loading), version parsing, exception raising (RuntimeError) upon missing modules or version mismatches.",
  "flows": "Input dependency names through the CHECKERS or check_deps() function, which then invoke importlib.import_module for the module, parse version, and possibly raise exceptions if checks fail.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of standard Python modules for dependency checking.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Checker class that validates whether a module is installed and meets a minimal version requirement. It dynamically imports modules using importlib.import_module, which can be exploited if module names are derived from untrusted input; however, in this context, dependency names are hardcoded or controlled via known variables. The version parsing and comparison use the 'packaging' library, and exception handling raises RuntimeError with hints if checks fail. The presence of install hints and explicit version requirements suggest proper dependency management. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware are present. The code performs its intended purpose without performing any harmful actions or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard dependency checker module with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It dynamically loads modules for verification and provides helpful error messages. It is safe based on current analysis, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
