{
  "purpose": "The code checks the availability and version compliance of specified Python dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input comes from the arguments passed to check_deps and the initialization parameters of Checker instances.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the importlib.import_module call which dynamically imports modules based on input strings.",
  "flows": "Input dependency names from check_deps → dynamic import via importlib.import_module → version parsing and validation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import based on user-controlled strings can be risky if untrusted input is provided, but here it appears to be controlled internally. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious strings are present. The code itself does not perform any network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dependency checker class that verifies the presence and version of specified modules, printing hints for installation if missing. It uses dynamic imports which are standard for such checks but can be risky if input is untrusted; however, in this code, dependency names are fixed and controlled. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is evident. No data leaks, system damage, or covert channels are present. The only potential concern is reliance on dynamic import, which could be exploited if dependency names are supplied externally, but in this context, it's internally managed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward dependency checker with no signs of malicious behavior. It performs standard module imports and version checks, with no suspicious side effects or malicious activities detected.",
