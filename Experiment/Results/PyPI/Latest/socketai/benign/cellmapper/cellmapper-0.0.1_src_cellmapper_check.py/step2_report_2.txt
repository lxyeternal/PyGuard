  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code performs dependency checks via dynamic importlib.import_module calls.\n- It uses version parsing and comparison.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The main potential risk is dynamic module import based on dependency names, which could be exploited if dependency names are supplied from untrusted sources.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard dependency checker, no malicious behavior, safe.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code does not perform any malicious actions, and the only concern is the dynamic import, which is controlled here. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard dependency check, no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough. No malicious behavior, straightforward logic. The risk score of 0 aligns with the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, dependency validation with no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.1) for the dynamic import, but still minimal, given the controlled context. Justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, dependency check with dynamic import based on input parameters, which are controlled.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The slight increase in risk score reflects the potential concern with dynamic import from possibly untrusted sources. Since the code itself is safe and the inputs are controlled, this is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same core logic, potential risk if inputs are untrusted, but no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The main concern is the dynamic import, but no malicious activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Justification and Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is correct. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above 0 for some reports (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting the potential risk of dynamic import if inputs are untrusted. Given the controlled context, these are reasonable.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n- To further reduce risk, dependency names could be validated against a whitelist before import.\n- The code could include a note that dependency names should not be supplied from untrusted sources.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (due to dynamic import, but controlled here)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the code and reports. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe dependency checker code is standard, safe, and performs its intended function without malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
