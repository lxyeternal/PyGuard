  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- **Report 1:**  \n  - Finds no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n  - Uses standard Python modules for dependency checking.  \n  - The dynamic import is controlled, and no suspicious code is present.  \n  - Malware score: 0  \n  - Confidence: 0.9  \n  - Security risk: 0.1\n\n- **Report 2:**  \n  - Similar conclusion: standard dependency check code, no malicious intent.  \n  - No obfuscation or suspicious activity.  \n  - Malware score: 0  \n  - Confidence: 1.0  \n  - Security risk: 0\n\n- **Report 3:**  \n  - Same as above, straightforward dependency validation.  \n  - No malicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n  - Malware score: 0  \n  - Confidence: 1.0  \n  - Security risk: 0.1\n\n- **Report 4:**  \n  - Slight concern about dynamic import with user-controlled strings, but inputs are controlled internally.  \n  - No malicious activity detected.  \n  - Malware score: 0  \n  - Confidence: 0.9  \n  - Security risk: 0.2\n\n- **Report 5:**  \n  - Similar to above, dynamic import is a potential risk if inputs are untrusted, but in this context, inputs are controlled.  \n  - No malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n  - Malware score: 0  \n  - Confidence: 0.9  \n  - Security risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  - No. All reports conclude that the code is a standard dependency checker with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  - The reports correctly identify the use of dynamic import as a potential risk but appropriately contextualize that in this code, the inputs are controlled.  \n  - No significant logical errors are evident.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  - Malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the analysis.  \n  - Security risk scores are low, reflecting minimal concern.  \n  - Confidence levels are high, matching the thoroughness of the reasoning.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):**  \n  - No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n  - Dynamic import based on controlled inputs is standard and not inherently malicious.  \n  - Therefore, the scores are reasonable.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  - The only potential concern is dynamic import with untrusted input, but in this code, the dependency names are controlled via parameters, not external user input.  \n  - No evidence of code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n  - The scores are consistent and justified given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation or hidden code)  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (very low, standard dependency check code)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- Considering the code is straightforward, with only a minor potential concern about dynamic import, which is controlled, I would assign:\n\n| Score Type   | Score |\n|--------------|--------|\n| Malware      | 0      |\n| Obfuscated   | 0      |\n| Risk         | 0.1    |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical dependency checker with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from the use of dynamic import, but since dependency names are controlled, this is acceptable. The malware score remains zero.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \n- Ensure dependency names are not derived from untrusted sources in future use cases.  \n- No changes needed to the code based on this review.  \n- The current scoring accurately reflects the code's safety profile.",
