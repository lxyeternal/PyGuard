{
  "purpose": "The code checks the availability and versions of specified Python dependencies, providing hints for installation if missing or outdated.",
  "sources": "Input is from the list of dependency names passed to the check_deps function; version information is obtained through the version() function call within the Checker class.",
  "sinks": "The importlib.import_module function loads modules based on user-specified dependency names; version parsing uses the version() function. No direct sinks that lead to security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "Dependency names from input → importlib.import_module for module loading; version() function call for version checking → raises RuntimeError if dependencies are missing or outdated.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; use of standard library modules and straightforward logic. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Checker class to verify module availability and version compliance, raising errors with install hints if requirements are unmet. The import process is dynamic but based solely on dependency names. The version check uses a standard parsing function. No malicious logic or covert behaviors are present. The design is typical for dependency validation, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard dependency checking without any malicious intent. It uses conventional techniques to verify modules and versions, providing helpful install hints. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
