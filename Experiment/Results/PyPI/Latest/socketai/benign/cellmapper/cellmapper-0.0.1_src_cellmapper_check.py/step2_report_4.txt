  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code performs dependency checks via dynamic imports (`importlib.import_module`) and version parsing.\n- It raises exceptions with helpful hints if dependencies are missing or outdated.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The dynamic import could pose a risk if dependency names are derived from untrusted sources, but in this context, they are controlled or predefined.\n- The code is standard for dependency validation and does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or covert operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code's purpose; sources are standard imports and class methods.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard use of importlib and version parsing.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent; high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The low security risk score reflects the minimal potential for harm, mainly due to dynamic import if input is untrusted, but in controlled scenarios, it's safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard dependency checks.\n- **Confidence:** Perfect (1.0).\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Same conclusions; dependency validation with dynamic import.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Highlights the potential risk of dynamic import if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower (0.9), acknowledging controlled inputs.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1-0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly notes the minimal risk associated with dynamic import, assuming inputs are controlled.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Similar to others, with emphasis on potential risks if dependency names are untrusted.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable; the primary concern is dynamic import if inputs are malicious, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly higher (0.1-0.2) in some reports due to the use of dynamic import with potentially untrusted input. However, in this context, dependency names are controlled, so the risk remains low.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:** None of the reports justify a higher score because the code does not perform any harmful actions. The only minor concern is dynamic import based on untrusted input, which is not present here.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Estimated Scores**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slight potential if dependency names are externally manipulated, but in the current context, negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented dependency checker with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security concern relates to dynamic import, but given the controlled usage, the risk remains very low.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Keep the dynamic import usage controlled and ensure dependency names are not derived from untrusted sources.  \n- Maintain clear documentation about input validation if dependency names are ever supplied externally.\n\n---\n\n**End of analysis.**",
