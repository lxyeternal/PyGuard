  "purpose": "The code checks the availability and versions of specified Python dependencies, providing hints for installation if missing or outdated.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to the Checker class (name, package_name, vmin, install_hint), and the list of dependencies to check in check_deps function.",
  "sinks": "The check method uses importlib.import_module to import modules dynamically based on the dependency name, and raises RuntimeError if conditions are not met.",
  "flows": "The check_deps function calls the check method on specified dependency checkers, which in turn import modules dynamically and evaluate versions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The importlib.import_module is used in a controlled manner to check modules; no code injection appears present. No obfuscation or unusual language features are used.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to verify dependencies by importing modules dynamically and checking versions against specified minimums. It includes a mechanism to provide install hints if dependencies are missing or outdated. The dynamic import uses module names supplied as arguments, which could be manipulated if the inputs are not validated externally, but within this code, the inputs are parameters passed at initialization, not influenced by external untrusted sources. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code is evident. The only dynamic operation is the importlib.import_module call, which is standard for dependency checks. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or malware. The use of version parsing and exception handling is appropriate for dependency validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency checker with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It safely performs dependency validation via dynamic imports and version checks, with no malicious signals detected.",
