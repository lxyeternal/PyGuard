  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports conclude that the code is a standard dependency checker that dynamically imports modules to verify their presence and version, providing install hints if needed.\n- They agree that the code uses standard Python modules (`importlib`, `packaging.version.parse`) and straightforward logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected.\n- The main potential concern noted is the use of dynamic imports based on dependency names, which could be risky if inputs are untrusted, but in this code, the dependency names are controlled or hardcoded.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), indicating strong agreement on safety.\n- Malware scores are all 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1 to 0.2), consistent with standard dependency checking code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  No. The code appears safe and performs standard dependency checks.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports correctly identify the use of dynamic import as a potential risk if inputs are untrusted but note that in this context, the inputs are controlled. They do not overstate the risk.\n\n- **Scores justification:**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate. The security risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal risk of the code itself. Given the controlled nature of dependency names, the risk is negligible.\n\n- **Higher risk scores?**  \n  No, the scores are reasonable. The only slight concern is the dynamic import, but it is acknowledged and deemed low risk.\n\n- **Malware justification:**  \n  Since no malicious activity or payloads are present, malware score remains 0.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  The reports do not assume vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code. They correctly identify the potential for risk if dependency names are untrusted but note that in this context, it's controlled.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report?**  \n  Yes, the scores align well with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, consistent with standard dependency checks)\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, due to dynamic import potential risk if inputs are untrusted, but this is controlled here)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, well-implemented dependency checker with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The potential dynamic import risk is acknowledged but minimal given the controlled context. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and keep the risk score very low (~0.1), considering the potential for misuse if dependency names are supplied externally, which is not indicated here.",
