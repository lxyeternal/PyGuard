{
  "purpose": "The code provides evaluation and visualization methods for assessing label transfer accuracy and expression transfer quality in a cell mapping workflow, focusing on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 scores, and expression correlation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from self.query.obs (cell annotations and confidence scores), self.query_imputed.var (per-gene metrics), and possibly file paths provided through save parameters for figures.",
  "sinks": "Generated plots (confusion matrix) and stored metrics in self.query_imputed.var, as well as logs. No evident sink involves untrusted data execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources such as confidence scores and labels flow into evaluation functions, which then compute metrics and store results. Plotting functions read labels and predictions to generate visualizations. Metrics and logs are outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code. Use of standard scientific libraries and logging is typical. No file or network I/O beyond plotting or attribute assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements evaluation routines using established metrics and plotting, relying on external libraries and class attributes. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration. The only potential concern might be if self.query or self.query_imputed contain untrusted data, but this is standard for such analysis code and does not constitute malicious intent. The code's structure and operations are typical for model evaluation in computational biology workflows, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate evaluation and visualization tasks for cell type label transfer and gene expression similarity assessments. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. The code is standard for a scientific analysis pipeline, with no suspicious or harmful components.",
