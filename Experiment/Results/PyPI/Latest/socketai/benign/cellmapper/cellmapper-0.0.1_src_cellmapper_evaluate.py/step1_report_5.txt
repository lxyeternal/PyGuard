{
  "purpose": "This code provides methods for evaluating cell annotation transfer and expression transfer accuracy within a computational biology framework, specifically for single-cell data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from object attributes such as self.query.obs, self.query.layers, and self.query_imputed.var; accesses attribute values, and loads data via slicing and attribute access.",
  "sinks": "Uses standard Python libraries for plotting and statistical computation; no apparent data sinks for untrusted data; no network, file system, or environment variable interactions are visible.",
  "flows": "Sources (input data) are processed locally for statistical evaluation and visualization; no untrusted data is sent over networks or written to insecure locations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The code performs legitimate statistical evaluation and visualization tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code contains functions for statistical comparison metrics (JS divergence, RMSE z-score) and class methods for evaluating label transfer accuracy and expression similarity. It relies on common scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib) and typical data attribute access patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation, are evident. The code is structured for legitimate evaluation purposes within a bioinformatics pipeline. There is no suspicious code flow or data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of evaluation metrics and visualization for single-cell data analysis. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The functions perform expected statistical computations and plotting without suspicious side effects.",
