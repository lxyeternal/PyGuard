{
  "purpose": "The code provides evaluation and visualization methods for assessing label transfer accuracy and expression similarity in single-cell datasets, primarily reading from internal attributes of a class instance.",
  "sources": "Reads data from class attributes such as self.query.obs, self.query_imputed.var, and self.query.layers, which are trusted data structures within the workflow.",
  "sinks": "Generates plots (confusion matrix) and stores metrics within object attributes; logs information. No external data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal attributes to metrics calculations, plotting functions, and internal storage; no external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Uses standard scientific libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard evaluation tasks for label transfer and expression similarity, including plotting confusion matrices and calculating correlation or divergence metrics. It accesses data from trusted internal attributes, processes it using well-known libraries, and stores results internally. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling suggests malicious intent. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation patterns. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are justified. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal inherent risk typical for scientific evaluation code, with no signs of malicious sabotage or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing legitimate evaluation and visualization tasks within a scientific workflow. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
