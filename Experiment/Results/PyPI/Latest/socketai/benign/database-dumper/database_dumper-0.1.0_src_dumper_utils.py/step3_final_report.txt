{
  "purpose": "The code visualizes database table relationships by drawing schema diagrams and retrieving related tables through foreign key relationships.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the Table objects, external modules (.db_inspector, .models), and the source_inspector function during schema inspection.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the source_inspector function, which may perform database queries or schema inspections, and the init_foreign method that initializes foreign key relationships.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the Table object through the draw function to generate string representations; additionally, get_all_related_chain uses source_inspector via init_foreign to build related table chains.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present. The code is straightforward and primarily manipulates strings for visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a schema visualization utility that relies on external modules for database schema inspection. It performs string manipulations to display table relationships. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The only external dependency, source_inspector, could pose a risk if malicious, but within this context, it appears benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature and external dependency considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility for visualizing database schemas. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern relates to the external modules, which should be reviewed separately. Overall, the current assessment scores are appropriate.",
