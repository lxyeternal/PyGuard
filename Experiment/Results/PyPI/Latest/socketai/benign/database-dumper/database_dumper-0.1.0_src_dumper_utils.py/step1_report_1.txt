{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate and visualize a chain of related database tables, starting from a given table name, using foreign key relationships.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'table' argument in get_table_chain and get_all_related_chain functions, and from the imported modules (.db_inspector and .models).",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems or files, but it calls source_inspector and initializes Table objects which may involve database interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (table name) through the Table class initialization and methods (init_foreign), eventually used in drawing functions, with no evident untrusted data handling that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The logic is straightforward, focusing on visual representation and database schema traversal.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs visualization and schema traversal tasks. It uses the Table class and source_inspector to build relationships, which could involve database access. The draw and get_table_chain functions generate text-based representations of the table relationships. There is no indication of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The imported modules are external and potentially could have vulnerabilities, but based on this code alone, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for visualizing database table relationships. It relies on external modules for database interactions, but the provided logic does not show signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code snippet.",
