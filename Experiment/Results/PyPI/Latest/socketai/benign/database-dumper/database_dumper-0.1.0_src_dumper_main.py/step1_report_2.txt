  "purpose": "A command-line application for dumping and visualizing database table data, with options to manipulate data and display table chains.",
  "sources": "Command line arguments (`argparse`) for input parameters such as database names, table names, and flags. Imports from local modules (.config, .dump, .utils).",
  "sinks": "Function calls to `settings.set_names`, `get_all_related_chain`, `get_table_chain`, and `dump_data` which may process untrusted input data.",
  "flows": "User inputs via command line are processed to set database names, generate table chains, visualize or dump data, and handle exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscated code present. The code relies on external modules for core operations, which are not provided here.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments securely with argparse. It calls external functions to set configurations, retrieve related table chains, visualize, and dump data. These external functions could potentially handle untrusted data, but from this code snippet, there's no indication of unsafe practices like executing dynamic code, network access, or handling untrusted input insecurely. The overall logic appears to be standard command-line database management utility, with no malicious intent detected. The code structure and flow are straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical database utility script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly orchestrates functions imported from other modules based on user input. Without inspecting the external modules, no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are apparent.",
