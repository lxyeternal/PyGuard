  "purpose": "CLI utility for database dump, visualization, and related operations, orchestrating external modules based on user input.",
  "sources": "Command line arguments (--name, --source, --target, etc.) used to set database names and trigger functions.",
  "sinks": "Delegates core operations to external modules; no direct untrusted data sinks within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "User inputs (source, target, name, flags) set configuration; then functions like get_all_related_chain, get_table_chain, dump_data are called, passing user-specified parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. Exception handling around print is trivial.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that relies on external modules for core logic. It performs argument parsing securely, sets configurations, and calls functions for database operations. No malicious or suspicious patterns are evident within this snippet. The external modules' security cannot be assessed here, but the code itself is benign. No obfuscation, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI utility for database dumping and visualization. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are detected. The low security risk score is justified, assuming external modules are safe.",
