{
  "purpose": "The script is a command-line utility for dumping and visualizing database tables, with options for data deletion and configuration.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (--name, --source, --target, etc.) and imports from local modules (.config, .dump, .utils).",
  "sinks": "The command-line arguments are used to configure database operations; no direct sink involves untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "User inputs (arguments) are processed to set database settings and generate table chains, then dumping or visualization is performed based on flags.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials present. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are observed. The code appears straightforward, calling functions from internal modules without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard argparse for CLI parsing, which is safe. It dynamically imports configuration and dump modules, likely for database operations. No evident code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. No hardcoded credentials or secret keys. The flow is predictable: parse args, set configuration, generate table chain, visualize or dump data. Exception handling is minimal but non-malicious. The code relies on external modules for core functionality, but the provided code itself shows no malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical database dump utility with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily orchestrates other modules without executing untrusted code or exposing sensitive data directly. Overall, it appears safe and clean.",
