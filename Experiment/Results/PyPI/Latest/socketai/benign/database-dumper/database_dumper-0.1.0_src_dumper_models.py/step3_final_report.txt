  "purpose": "Modeling database tables and their foreign key relationships for schema introspection and management.",
  "sources": "External inspector object providing foreign key metadata (e.g., SQLAlchemy inspector).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data flows from inspector to in-memory data structures.",
  "flows": "Inspector retrieves foreign key info -> add_foreign creates Table instances -> init_foreign recursively populates relationships.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard recursion with cycle detection via has_table; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Table class for representing database tables and their foreign key relationships, using a helper _str_list for input normalization. It includes methods to add foreign key relationships, check for existing tables, and initialize relationships via an inspector, likely from SQLAlchemy. The code is straightforward, with proper type annotations, exception handling, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The recursive init_foreign method could, in theory, cause deep recursion with cyclic schemas, but the has_table check prevents infinite loops. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The external inspector is a standard pattern in schema introspection, and trusting it is typical in such contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for schema relationship management. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reliance on an external inspector is standard and not inherently risky. The minimal security risk score of 0 is appropriate, with no malware detected.",
