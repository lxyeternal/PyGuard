{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for managing database table relationships and foreign key dependencies, primarily used for schema analysis or ORM functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function arguments, class attributes, and method calls such as 'inspector.get_foreign_keys'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include 'inspector.get_foreign_keys' which may return untrusted data, but in typical use, this is controlled via the database schema and not user input.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading schema information via 'inspector', creating Table objects, and establishing relationships through 'add_foreign' method, which processes foreign key data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code performs standard data structure management without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a data structure to model database tables and their foreign key relationships, including methods to add and check relationships. It utilizes standard type hints and exception handling. The only external dependency is 'inspector', which is expected to be a database schema inspector, not user-controlled input. There is no code that performs network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. Overall, the code appears focused on schema management without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard implementation for managing database table relationships, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.",
