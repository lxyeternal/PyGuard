{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for managing database table relationships, specifically foreign key relationships, in an object-oriented manner.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, especially in add_foreign() and init_foreign() methods, and external data from the inspector object in init_foreign().",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code primarily manipulates in-memory objects and calls methods on the inspector object. It does not execute or evaluate untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input (inspector.get_foreign_keys) into creating Table objects, which are then linked via add_foreign(). There are no evident data flow vulnerabilities or injections.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code relies on external inspector object for database schema information, which is standard. No backdoors, malicious behaviors, or privacy violations are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for modeling database foreign key relationships. It uses type annotations, property decorators, and recursive foreign key initialization. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The only external data source is the inspector object, which is expected in ORM/database contexts. No untrusted code execution, data leaks, or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured utility for managing database table relationships. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It functions as a typical ORM helper module.",
