{
  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security risks of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Code segments, dynamic code execution points, network connections, hardcoded secrets, input/output handling.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data processing, network transmission, environment variable access, file modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into processing functions, which may lead to sinks like network sockets or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, use of eval/exec, suspicious dynamic code, hardcoded credentials, unusual imports, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign with standard library usage, no obfuscation, and no suspicious network activity. Obfuscation suspicion exists only in report 3, which notes dynamic code constructs but no definitive malicious behavior. Scores are generally aligned with the observations: malware scores are low, obfuscation scores reflect suspicion where indicated, and security risks are moderate where obfuscation or ambiguity is present. The confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context. No concrete malicious indicators are detected, and the code structure does not suggest sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is likely safe, with minimal malicious intent. Obfuscation suspicion warrants cautious scoring but does not indicate confirmed malicious activity. Overall, the security risk is low, and the scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.3,
