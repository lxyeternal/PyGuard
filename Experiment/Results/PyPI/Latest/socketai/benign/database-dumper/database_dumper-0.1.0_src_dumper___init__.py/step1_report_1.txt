  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or functionality involving third-party libraries, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from imported modules, environment variables, or function parameters (if any).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system commands that could send data externally or modify system state.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input, environment variables, or external modules to sinks like network or file operations, possibly via intermediate variables.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features. No suspicious backdoors or hidden code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard Python libraries and imports without any signs of obfuscation or malicious modifications. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are evident. The flow from input sources to sinks appears typical for normal operations. Lack of suspicious network connections or system modifications suggests low malicious intent. However, incomplete code context limits full assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear indications of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or malware. The code appears benign with standard practices, though the absence of complete context warrants a cautious low-confidence assessment.",
