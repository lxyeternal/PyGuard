  "purpose": "Establishes database connections and inspects schemas using environment-based URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads database URLs from settings (settings.source_url and settings.target_url).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; relies on external configuration for database connection strings.",
  "flows": "Loads environment variables -> creates engines with URLs from settings -> inspects databases.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing standard database setup routines with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It uses external configuration for URLs, which could be manipulated, but this is outside the code's scope. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The malware score is correctly set to 0. The risk score is low (0.1-0.2), justified by reliance on external configuration, but not an inherent flaw. The code's structure and purpose are clear and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign database initialization routine with no malicious intent or security issues. External configuration dependency is a normal risk factor but not a code flaw. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
