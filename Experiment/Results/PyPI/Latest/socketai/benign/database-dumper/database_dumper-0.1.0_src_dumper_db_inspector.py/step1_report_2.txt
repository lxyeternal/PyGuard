  "purpose": "Initialize database connections and load environment variables for source and target databases.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via load_dotenv(), importing configuration from .config.settings, accessing settings.source_url and settings.target_url.",
  "targets": "Creating SQLAlchemy engines for source and target databases, inspecting their schemas.",
  "flows": "load_dotenv() loads environment variables; settings.source_url and settings.target_url provide database URLs; create_engine() connects to databases; inspect() retrieves schema info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. Usage of environment variables is standard practice. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables, establishes database connections for source and target databases, and inspects their schemas. All operations are standard for database setup scripts. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The code relies on external configuration for credentials, which is normal. The use of SQLAlchemy's create_engine and inspect functions aligns with typical database management routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for database schema inspection and does not contain malicious intent or security risks. It simply loads environment variables, connects to databases, and inspects schemas as part of a larger data management process.",
