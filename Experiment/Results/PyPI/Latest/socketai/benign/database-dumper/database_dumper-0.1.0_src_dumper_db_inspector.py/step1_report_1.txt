  "purpose": "Load environment variables and set up database engine connections for source and target databases.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via dotenv.load_dotenv(), accessing settings.source_url and settings.target_url.",
  "sinks": "create_engine() from SQLAlchemy, which establishes database connections using URLs from settings.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> settings (source_url and target_url) -> create_engine() -> database connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard use of dotenv and SQLAlchemy. No suspicious code or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables with dotenv, then creates SQLAlchemy engine objects for source and target databases using URLs from a configuration object. It also inspects these engines and prepares metadata objects. The use of dotenv and SQLAlchemy appears typical for database setup. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code does not perform any suspicious data handling or network activity beyond establishing database connections.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard database setup routine with environment variable loading. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks based on this snippet. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
