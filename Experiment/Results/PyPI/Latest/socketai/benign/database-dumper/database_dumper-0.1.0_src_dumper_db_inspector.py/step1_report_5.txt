  "purpose": "Initialize database connections and load environment variables for database operations.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via load_dotenv() and accessing settings.source_url, settings.target_url.",
  "sinks": "create_engine() function used to establish database connections with URLs, and inspect() to analyze database schemas.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and configuration settings flow into create_engine() calls to establish database connections; connection objects then used for schema inspection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code constructs. Usage of environment variables for URLs is standard practice. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables, then creates two database engines based on URLs from configuration settings. It inspects these databases to retrieve schema information. All operations appear standard for database setup. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. Usage of dotenv and SQLAlchemy is typical in Python projects. No data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious logic detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical setup for database schema inspection using environment variables and configuration settings. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be standard, safe code.",
