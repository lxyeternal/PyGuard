  "purpose": "Load environment variables and set up database engine connections for source and target databases.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via dotenv.load_dotenv(), configuration settings from .config module (settings.source_url and settings.target_url).",
  "sinks": "Creating SQLAlchemy engines using URLs from settings, which could potentially be malicious if URLs are manipulated or maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and configuration settings flow into create_engine() functions to establish database connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible; usage of environment variables and configuration is standard. No unusual code patterns or dynamic execution detected. The code appears straightforward and typical for database setup.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables and configuration settings, then creates SQLAlchemy engine objects for source and target databases. It uses inspect() to prepare for database schema introspection. The code is minimal, with no suspicious logic or obfuscated elements. The main risk could be if the URLs in settings are malicious or manipulated, but that depends on external configuration, not the code itself. No malicious behavior or malware patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is standard database setup code for a Python project, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It relies on external configuration for URLs, which could be misconfigured but is not inherently malicious.",
