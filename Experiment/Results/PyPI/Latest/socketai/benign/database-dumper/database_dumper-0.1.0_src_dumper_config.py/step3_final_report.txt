  "purpose": "Load database configuration from 'pyproject.toml' and construct PostgreSQL URLs using environment variables with configurable prefixes and source/target names.",
  "sources": "Reading 'pyproject.toml' file, accessing environment variables via os.getenv() for username, password, host, database, and port.",
  "sinks": "URL.create() method that constructs SQLAlchemy URL objects from environment variables.",
  "flows": "Configuration data is read from file and environment variables; URL.create() uses these variables to generate database connection URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in key 'env_patten' instead of 'env_pattern'; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration from a TOML file, retrieves connection parameters via environment variables, and constructs database URLs. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The typo 'env_patten' could cause misconfiguration but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assign malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low security risk (~0.2), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration loader for database URLs, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The only issue is a minor typo that could affect configuration correctness but not security. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent.",
