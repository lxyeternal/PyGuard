  "purpose": "Load database configuration from a pyproject.toml file and generate PostgreSQL connection URLs using environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reading the pyproject.toml file, accessing environment variables for username, password, host, database, and port.",
  "sinks": "Creating SQLAlchemy URL objects with potentially untrusted environment variable data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables through the __create_url method into the URL.create call.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; environment variables are used for sensitive data. The code dynamically constructs URLs based on environment variables, which is standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration from a TOML file and uses environment variables to assemble database connection URLs. The environment variables are dynamically named based on prefixes and source/target names, which is a common pattern for configuration management. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system harm. The code does not perform any network communication or system modifications beyond URL construction. It uses standard libraries and follows safe practices by avoiding hardcoded secrets. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a configuration loader that builds database connection URLs from environment variables, based on configurations read from a TOML file. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this code.",
