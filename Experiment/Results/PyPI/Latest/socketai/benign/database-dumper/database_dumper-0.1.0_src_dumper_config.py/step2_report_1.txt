  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code loads configuration from `pyproject.toml` and constructs URLs using environment variables.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- The score for malware is 0, security risk is 0.2, which is reasonable given the use of environment variables for sensitive data.\n- The confidence is high (0.9), and no issues are noted.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar findings; notes a typo in `'env_patten'` instead of `'env_pattern'`.\n- No malicious intent or suspicious code.\n- Typo could cause misconfiguration but is benign.\n- Malware score remains 0, security risk 0.2, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates similar observations.\n- Highlights the typo again.\n- No malicious behavior; standard configuration loader.\n- Malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern; emphasizes the configuration via environment variables and the typo.\n- No suspicious or malicious code.\n- Malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar findings; standard pattern.\n- No evidence of malicious activity.\n- Malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—it's a configuration loader without any malicious payload or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscated code.\n- **Security risk:** The overall security risk score is low (0.2), which is reasonable given the code's purpose and behavior.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The reliance on environment variables is standard but can be risky if environment variables are compromised; however, this is a common practice and not inherently malicious.\n- **Typo in `'env_patten'`:** Repeatedly noted, but this is a configuration issue, not malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, typical for configuration code)\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign configuration utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent.** The minor typo does not introduce security vulnerabilities but could cause misconfiguration if not corrected.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested scores:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.2** |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and does not pose security threats. The environment variable handling is typical, and no malicious activity is evident. The minor typo should be corrected for proper functionality but does not impact security.",
