  "purpose": "This code loads database configuration from a 'pyproject.toml' file, retrieves environment variables to construct PostgreSQL database URLs, and provides a class to manage these settings.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'pyproject.toml' file and environment variables for database credentials (username, password, host, database, port).",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables to create database URLs via sqlalchemy's URL.create method, which could potentially be used to connect to a database.",
  "flows": "Configuration data is loaded from a file; environment variables are accessed during URL creation; these values are combined to produce database connection URLs.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically constructs environment variable names based on configurable prefixes and uses them directly in URL creation. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Typo in 'env_pattern' key ('env_patten') might cause misconfiguration, but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a configuration file to obtain prefixes for environment variable names. It then accesses environment variables using these constructed names to build database connection URLs. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observed. The environment variables are standard for database credentials and are used in a typical manner. The typo in 'env_pattern' key could lead to default pattern being used, but this is an implementation detail, not malicious. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are present. Overall, the code appears to be a standard configuration loader with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely loads database configuration details from a config file and environment variables, assembling connection URLs. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The only minor concern is a typo in the 'env_pattern' key, which does not introduce security issues but could affect functionality.",
