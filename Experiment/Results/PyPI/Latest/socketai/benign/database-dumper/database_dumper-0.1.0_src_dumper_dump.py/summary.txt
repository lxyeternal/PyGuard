  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data migration utility with some risky practices related to dynamic SQL and internal attribute access. There is no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the potential for SQL injection if table names are untrusted, which is reflected in the moderate risk score (~0.3). Proper sanitization of table identifiers would mitigate this risk. The overall scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
