  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential issues, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code performs data migration between source and target databases.\n- Common concerns include dynamic SQL construction via string interpolation and use of private attributes (_columns, _mapping).\n- No report detects actual malicious activity, backdoors, or malware.\n- The primary risks identified are related to SQL injection potential if table names are untrusted and the unconventional use of internal attributes.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Data dumping with optional truncation and column removal.\n- **Anomalies:** String interpolation in SQL commands (potential SQL injection), use of private attributes.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, but the dynamic SQL with table names could be dangerous if table names are untrusted.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.4 (moderate due to dynamic SQL).\n\n**Assessment:** The risk score seems appropriate. No malware detected. The moderate risk reflects the potential SQL injection if table names are maliciously crafted.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar data dump with truncation.\n- **Anomalies:** Raw SQL text for TRUNCATE, no validation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, standard data transfer.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (low).\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk score is justified. No malware detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Recursive data dump, similar functionality.\n- **Anomalies:** Dynamic SQL with string formatting, internal attribute access.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent, just risky practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.3.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk due to internal attribute access and dynamic SQL, but still no malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Data transfer with truncation and column removal.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of private attributes, raw SQL commands.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, standard data migration.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous, appropriate low risk score.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Data migration with truncation and schema inspection.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward data copying, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting potential SQL injection risks due to dynamic SQL construction with untrusted table names, and unconventional use of internal attributes.\n\n**Given the code's functionality and the analysis, I would suggest:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 to 0.4, depending on the environment and trust level of table names.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- The overall risk is moderate due to dynamic SQL construction. Proper sanitization of table names would reduce this risk.\n- No evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n- The scores across reports are reasonable and consistent.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2 - 0.4 |\n\n**This aligns with the analysis that the code is a typical data migration utility with some minor risky practices but no malicious intent.**",
