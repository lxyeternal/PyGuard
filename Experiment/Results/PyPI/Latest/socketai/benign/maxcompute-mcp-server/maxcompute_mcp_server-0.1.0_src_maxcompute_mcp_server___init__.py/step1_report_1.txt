{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for a package, running the 'main' function from a local 'server' module using asyncio.",
  "sources": "The code imports a local 'server' module and reads nothing else beyond the import and function call.",
  "sinks": "The code executes server.main() asynchronously; potential concern if server.main() is malicious or insecure, but no direct data sink is present here.",
  "flows": "The source (imported server module) leads to execution of server.main() via asyncio.run(), but no untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. No external data input handling or insecure patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple orchestrator that imports a local server module and runs its main() function asynchronously. It includes an __all__ declaration for exposing main and server. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Since server.main() is invoked, its security depends on its implementation, but within this snippet, no malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign entry point for a package, simply delegating execution to server.main(). There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues in this code segment.",
