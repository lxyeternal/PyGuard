  "purpose": "Entry point that delegates execution to server.main() asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Import of local 'server' module; call to server.main() within main() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data handling or network operations within this snippet.",
  "flows": "main() calls server.main() asynchronously; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and standard for an async application entry point. It imports a local module and runs its main() function asynchronously. No malicious or insecure patterns are present. The security assessment depends on the implementation of server.main(), which is outside this scope. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on external implementation of server.main(). The scores are justified and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
