  "purpose": "To serve as an entry point that runs the main function from the server module using asyncio.",
  "sources": "Import statement for server module, call to server.main() within asyncio.run()",
  "sinks": "The call to server.main() executed within asyncio.run()",
  "flows": "Import -> main() -> asyncio.run(server.main())",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code execution, or suspicious imports; the code is straightforward and typical for an async entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module 'server' and executes its main() function within asyncio.run(). There are no indications of malicious data handling, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The structure is minimal and typical for asynchronous Python applications. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are directly used here. The import statement and function call are standard patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard entry point for an async server application with no malicious behavior detected. It simply runs the server's main() function asynchronously. There are no security risks or anomalies identified.",
