{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for a package, invoking an asynchronous main function from a local server module.",
  "sources": "The code reads nothing directly from external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only runs an imported async function.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: the script calls asyncio.run on server.main(), which is an internal async function. No external data flows are visible.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The code appears standard and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module 'server' and runs its main() function asynchronously. It exposes 'main' and 'server' in __all__ for external access. There are no hardcoded secrets, no data manipulation, and no network or file operations in this snippet. The simplicity and clarity suggest no malicious intent or security issues within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple entry point that calls an asynchronous server main function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks in this snippet. Its structure is standard, and it appears safe.",
