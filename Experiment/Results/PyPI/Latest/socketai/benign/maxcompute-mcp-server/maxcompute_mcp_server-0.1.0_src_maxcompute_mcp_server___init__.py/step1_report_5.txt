{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point that runs the main function from a local server module using asyncio.",
  "sources": "Imports server module, uses asyncio.run to execute server.main()",
  "sinks": "Calls server.main(), which may contain untrusted data handling or network operations",
  "flows": "Imports server; calls asyncio.run(server.main()), which executes code within server.main()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious operations within this snippet",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing a server module and executing its main function asynchronously. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The only potential concern depends on what server.main() does, but within this code alone, there is nothing suspicious or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple and benign entry point for a server application, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
