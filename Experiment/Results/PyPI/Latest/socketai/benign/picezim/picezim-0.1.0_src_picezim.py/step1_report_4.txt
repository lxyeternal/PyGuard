  "purpose": "Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'r' for radius.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the computed area; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input 'r' flows directly into the calculation, then to the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the math library to perform a mathematical calculation. It defines a function 'circle_area' that takes a radius 'r' as input and returns the area of a circle using the formula πr^2. There are no external data sources, no untrusted data processing, or suspicious operations. The code is straightforward and typical for such a task.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard calculation of circle area with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
