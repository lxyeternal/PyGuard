  "purpose": "Calculate the area of a circle given its radius using the math library.",
  "sources": "Function parameter 'r' as input; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Return statement output; no untrusted data sinks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input 'r' flows directly into the calculation, returning the result without external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, correct implementation of a circle area calculation using standard math library. It contains no external data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and confidence of 1. The code's simplicity and lack of external effects confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, performing a basic mathematical calculation without any malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
