  "purpose": "This code appears to be a simple script for demonstrating basic input handling and processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the user via the input() function.",
  "sinks": "The user input is processed and printed; no sensitive data is sent elsewhere or stored.",
  "flows": "Input() reads data -> data is processed (possibly manipulated) -> printed output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code are present. No unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts user input and outputs processed data without involving external network connections or file manipulations. It uses standard Python features with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious code patterns. The code structure is straightforward, with no embedded or obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign input/output script with no supply chain security issues.",
