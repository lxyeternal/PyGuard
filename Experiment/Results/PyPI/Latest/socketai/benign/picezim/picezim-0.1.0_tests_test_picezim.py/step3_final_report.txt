  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, network or file I/O operations, environment variable access, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points, system modifications.",
  "flows": "From data sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, file, system modifications) via code logic.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, unusual variable naming, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code presence, with scores reflecting benign assessments. Reports 1 and 4 acknowledge potential data flows but no malicious activity, assigning low security risk (0.2). Reports 2, 3, and 5 note empty or placeholder code, with zero scores for malware and obfuscation. The confidence levels are appropriate given the descriptions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are identified. The scores are consistent with the code summaries, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign across all reports, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. Security risks are minimal, and the scoring accurately reflects the benign nature. The assessments are consistent and justified; no changes are recommended.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
