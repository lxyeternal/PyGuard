  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a placeholder or a default template with no specific functionality, as it contains only an empty code block.",
  "sources": "No data sources, input, or external data reads are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present due to the lack of code or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is completely empty, which is unusual for an active package or script. It could be a placeholder, but as is, it contains no logic, no variables, and no functions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an empty code block, indicating either an incomplete script or a template. There are no sources, sinks, data flows, or logic to analyze. No suspicious or malicious patterns can be identified in an empty script. The absence of code itself does not suggest malicious intent, but it also provides no security insights.",
  "conclusion": "The code is empty, with no operational or malicious elements. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely a placeholder or incomplete script with no malicious intent.",
