  "purpose": "This source code appears to perform data processing or manipulation tasks, but without specific comments or context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or external files (if any are present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or system commands if present, especially those that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user inputs or environment variables through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like network transmission or file I/O.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Usage of dynamic execution or unconventional language features was not observed.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for suspicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or misuse of environment variables. No significant malicious indicators, such as network calls to suspicious domains, credential theft, or embedded backdoors, were found. The code structure appears standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Usage of third-party libraries seems legitimate. Absence of hardcoded secrets and unusual behaviors suggests the code is likely benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard data processing script with no evident supply chain threats or malware indicators.",
