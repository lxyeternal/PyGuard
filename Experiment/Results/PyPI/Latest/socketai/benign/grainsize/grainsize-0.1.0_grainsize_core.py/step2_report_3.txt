  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code details with the security criteria.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard data processing classes for geoscience data, reading Excel files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data stored in DataFrames, no external network activity; outputs are CSVs and images.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.\n- **Analysis:** All functions are typical for scientific analysis—reading files, transforming data, plotting.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; code appears benign.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on data analysis and visualization with standard libraries.\n- No suspicious code, no dynamic execution, no external communication.\n- Functions are typical for scientific workflows.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risks detected.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, standard data loading, cleaning, and plotting routines.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious code, no external system commands.\n- Uses common libraries, handles data files securely.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; code is benign.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, with data processing, plotting, and file I/O.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external threats.\n- File operations are explicit and controlled.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard scientific code.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same pattern: data loading, processing, visualization.\n- No suspicious code or external network activity.\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), possibly due to file writing operations, but this is typical for such tools.\n- No malware detected.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the nature of the code, the only minor concern is file output operations, which are standard and controlled.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\nThe code is a well-structured, standard scientific data analysis toolkit. It performs data loading, cleaning, statistical calculations, and plotting using common libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The minor security risk score in report 5 reflects typical data export operations, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (standard data export operations, no significant security concern)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, legitimate, and typical for scientific data processing. No security risks or malware are present.",
