  "purpose": "This code provides classes for analyzing and visualizing foraminifera and bryozoans data from core samples, including statistical tests, plotting, and data validation.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files (pd.read_csv) for Forams class; reads Excel files (pd.read_excel) for Bryozoans class; handles dataframes provided directly.",
  "sinks": "Uses plotting functions that generate figures; no external data sinks or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Data is read from files, processed within class methods, and visualized via matplotlib and seaborn; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data manipulation; no unusual or misleading code structures detected; functions perform standard statistical and plotting operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data validation, normalization, and visualization tasks for biological data analysis. It includes data import functions, statistical testing (chi-squared, Mann-Whitney, correlation), and plotting routines with options for saving figures. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. All data handling appears legitimate and related to scientific analysis. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden backdoors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific data analysis module focused on biological core sample data, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs data validation, statistical analysis, and visualization securely. No malware or security threats are detected based on the provided code.",
