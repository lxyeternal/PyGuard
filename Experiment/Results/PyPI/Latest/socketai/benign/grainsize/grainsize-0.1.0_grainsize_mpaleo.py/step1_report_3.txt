{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and methods for analyzing, plotting, and comparing biological data related to foraminifera and bryozoans from sediment core samples.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from CSV and Excel files through pandas functions, or provided as dataframes directly via class constructors.",
  "sinks": "The code generates plots and visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn; no data is sent over the network, saved to external sources, or exposed externally.",
  "flows": "Data is read via pandas (from files or dataframes), processed within class methods for calculations and normalization, then visualized via plotting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are observed. No unusual or obfuscated code patterns are present. The code performs standard data analysis and plotting tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script is a structured Python module with classes for data processing and visualization related to biological samples. It performs data validation, normalization, statistical testing, and plotting with standard libraries. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as network communication, system modifications, or hidden backdoors, are present. The code's only data input methods are reading files and dataframes; outputs are visualizations and statistical summaries. There are warnings about potential statistical issues but no security risks. Overall, the code is straightforward and intended for scientific data analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical data analysis and plotting script for biological data with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard libraries and practices without obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
