  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions for analyzing, visualizing, and statistically comparing foraminifera and bryozoans data, primarily for scientific research purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is read from CSV and Excel files through pandas read_csv and read_excel functions, with parameters supplied at object instantiation. Data is used internally for calculations and plotting.",
  "sinks": "Generated plots are saved as image files if specified. No other sinks (e.g., network, system commands) are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input during object creation -> data validation and processing -> visualization functions generate plots and save images.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Usage of warnings and typical plotting functions are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for data analysis with input validation, statistical testing, and plotting. It relies solely on standard libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy. No dynamic code execution, network access, or system commands are present. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior are observed. Functions perform typical data analysis tasks, with proper handling of inputs and edge cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard scientific data analysis toolkit with no malicious intent or suspicious features. It adheres to typical data processing and visualization practices without evident malicious behavior.",
