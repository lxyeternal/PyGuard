  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk, and verify if the reported issues align with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard scientific analysis toolkit with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The code only uses standard libraries, performs data validation, normalization, statistical tests, and plotting. No network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. The low risk score seems appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's legitimacy, standard data handling, and absence of malicious features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a typical data analysis module with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard data processing and visualization, no malicious features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical analysis and visualization toolkit with no malicious features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct. The code contains no network, system, or malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal security concern. The only minor concern is the warnings and data handling, but these are standard in scientific scripts.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (negligible security risk, standard data analysis code)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a legitimate scientific analysis toolkit with no security threats.\n\n**My own assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
