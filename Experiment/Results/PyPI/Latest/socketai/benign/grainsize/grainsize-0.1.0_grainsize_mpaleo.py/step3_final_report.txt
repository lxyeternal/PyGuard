{
  "purpose": "The code provides a scientific analysis toolkit for foraminifera and bryozoans, including data import, validation, normalization, statistical testing, and plotting functions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from CSV or Excel files using pandas; no external inputs or untrusted data sources are directly involved.",
  "sinks": "Generated plots and warnings; no data exfiltration, network activity, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reading into dataframes, through validation and calculations, into plotting functions that visualize the processed data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious operations detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard scientific data analysis module utilizing common libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn). It performs data validation, normalization, statistical tests, and visualization without any dynamic code execution, network access, or obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The warnings are standard for data validation and do not indicate malicious intent. The overall structure and functions are typical for such analysis scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific analysis tool with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is set to 0, the obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score to 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to data handling but no actual security concern.",
