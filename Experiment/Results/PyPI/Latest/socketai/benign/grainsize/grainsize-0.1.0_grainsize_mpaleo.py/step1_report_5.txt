{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for analyzing and visualizing biological data, specifically foraminifera and bryozoans, including statistical tests, plotting, and data validation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from CSV or Excel files via pandas functions (pd.read_csv, pd.read_excel). No other input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Plots are generated and optionally saved to files; data summaries are returned as DataFrames. No direct data leaks or untrusted outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from files into DataFrames, processed via various methods, and visualized through plots. No untrusted data flow to external systems like networks or external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as code injection, dynamic execution, or obfuscated logic. Use of warnings for missing data is standard; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles data analysis and visualization with standard pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy functions. No indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, system commands, or data exfiltration. The functions are straightforward, with typical statistical and plotting routines. No hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors are present. Use of warnings and plotting logic appears legitimate. The code structure is conventional and well-organized, without obfuscation or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard scientific data analysis toolkit for biological datasets with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs data validation, statistical testing, and visualization in a typical manner. There are no external network connections, data leaks, or hidden malicious behaviors.",
