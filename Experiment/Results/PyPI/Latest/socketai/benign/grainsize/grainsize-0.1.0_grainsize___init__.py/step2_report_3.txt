  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as solely consisting of import statements from internal modules.\n- No evidence of data handling, external communication, or dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are noted.\n- The purpose appears to be setting up a scientific or analytical package related to geology or paleontology.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Since the code is only import statements, this is appropriate.\n\n**Security Risk Scores:**\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Score Justification & Recommendations:**\n- The scores seem consistent and justified based on the code snippet.\n- No adjustments are necessary, as the code is straightforward and does not exhibit any signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is purely structural, importing classes/functions for use elsewhere.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk factors are present.\n- The high confidence scores (1) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, well-structured, and free of security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is needed.",
