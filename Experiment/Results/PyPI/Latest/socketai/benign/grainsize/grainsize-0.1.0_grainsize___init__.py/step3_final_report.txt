  "purpose": "Import statements for internal modules related to geological and paleontological data analysis.",
  "sources": "Internal module files: .core, .clustering, .mpaleo",
  "sinks": "None; no data handling or external communication present",
  "flows": "None; only static import statements",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import statements with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, indicating setup for a scientific package. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or external communication is present. The code is clear, standard, and benign. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. Confidence in benign assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard setup for a scientific package, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
