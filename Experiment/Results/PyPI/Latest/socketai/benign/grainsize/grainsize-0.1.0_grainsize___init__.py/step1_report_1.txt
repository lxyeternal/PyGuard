{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes or functions from various modules within a package, likely to use them for geological or paleontological data analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .core, .clustering, .mpaleo",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions are present that handle untrusted input or output data",
  "flows": "No data flow or input/output handling detected within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely import statements with no additional logic, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no anomalous behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, importing classes or functions relevant to geological or paleontological analysis. No malicious behavior, no code injection, data leaks, or suspicious activity is evident. The structure is straightforward and standard for a Python package. There are no anomalies or signs of sabotage or malware. Since it is only import statements, it does not perform any actions that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, comprising only import statements with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, legitimate package for geological or paleontological data processing.",
