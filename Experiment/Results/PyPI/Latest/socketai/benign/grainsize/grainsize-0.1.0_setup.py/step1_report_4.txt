  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'grainsize', defining metadata, dependencies, and package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading the long description from 'README.md' file, obtaining package information via find_packages(), and specifying install_requires dependencies.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sources, user inputs, or external data flows are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs; the script solely uses static configuration and file reads during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or unusual code constructs detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for description and specifies dependencies. No user inputs, network operations, or dynamic code are present. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this setup script. It functions solely as a package configuration file with no malicious intent.",
