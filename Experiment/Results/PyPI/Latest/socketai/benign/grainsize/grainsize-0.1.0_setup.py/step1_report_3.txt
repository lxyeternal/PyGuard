  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'grainsize'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the long description from 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data or execute external commands; it primarily prepares package metadata.",
  "flows": "The source (reading 'README.md') flows into the setup configuration for package description; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The setup script is standard and uses well-known functions from setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools', defines package metadata, reads a markdown file for the long description, and specifies dependencies and package exclusions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The code is straightforward and follows common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate packaging configuration.",
