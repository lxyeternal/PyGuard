{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'grainsize' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file using open() to obtain long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or dynamic code execution involved.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.md' and passes static package data; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools. It reads a local markdown file for description, specifies dependencies, and package exclusions. No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. Multiple expert reviews confirm the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risk scores (~0.1). The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices indicate no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and appropriate given the code's straightforward nature.",
