  "purpose": "The code is for setting up and configuring a Python package named 'grainsize', including its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "The long description from 'README.md' flows from the file read into the setup configuration; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard setup operations with no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for a Python package, using setuptools to specify package metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion/exclusion rules. It reads a Markdown README for the long description, which is a common practice. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network operations, or processing of untrusted input. No obfuscated or malicious code is present. All operations are standard for package configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is legitimate, standard package configuration code with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
