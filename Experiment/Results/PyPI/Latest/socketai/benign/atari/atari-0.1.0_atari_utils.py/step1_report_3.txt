{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse BED and GTF files to extract genomic regions and features, respectively.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from files specified by 'bed_file' and 'gtf_file' parameters, using open() to load data line by line.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct data sinks such as network connections, system modifications, or external communications present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input (open/read) to in-memory data structures (lists, dictionaries). No untrusted data is propagated to external systems or outputs that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard file parsing with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. No suspicious dynamic code execution or backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input files (BED and GTF formats) using open() calls, processes the lines to extract genomic features, and stores this data in structured Python objects. No external or untrusted data sources are used beyond file input. There are no network operations, no execution of untrusted code, nor any manipulation that would lead to malicious behavior. The attribute parsing handles typical formats with care. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward data parsing routines for genomic annotation files without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard file parsing for genomic data without signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It does not contain suspicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No security risks are identified based on the provided code segment.",
