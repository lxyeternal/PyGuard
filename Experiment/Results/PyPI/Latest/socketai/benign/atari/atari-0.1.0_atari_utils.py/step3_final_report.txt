{
  "purpose": "Parse regions from BED and gene features from GTF files for genomic analysis.",
  "sources": "Input file paths provided as function arguments; file lines read during parsing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data is processed in-memory without external transmission.",
  "flows": "File input -> line parsing -> data structure population; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard, well-structured parsing of BED and GTF files, handling comment lines, splitting fields, converting coordinates, and extracting attributes. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The functions include basic validation and handle expected input formats. The code is transparent and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical genomic data parser with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It operates safely within its scope, with minimal inherent security risk primarily related to resource exhaustion in edge cases. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious features justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score.",
