{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse BED and GTF files to extract genomic regions and features, and to compute total region size.",
  "sources": "File reads from 'bed_file' and 'gtf_file' using open() calls.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; data is processed internally without external output or network transmission.",
  "flows": "File content read from open() -> parsed into data structures -> processed to compute sizes and organize features.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious data leaks or backdoors. Parsing functions follow standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file reading operations on user-provided paths, parsing content into data structures with standard methods. No untrusted data output, network activity, or obfuscated logic. It correctly skips comment lines and handles attribute parsing with flexibility. No evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior patterns; the functions are typical for bioinformatics data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate and safe for its intended purpose of parsing genomic data files. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
