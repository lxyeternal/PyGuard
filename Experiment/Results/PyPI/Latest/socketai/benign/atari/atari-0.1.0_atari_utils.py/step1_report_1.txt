{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse BED and GTF files to extract genomic regions and features such as genes, exons, transcripts, and coding sequences.",
  "sources": "File reads from 'open(bed_file, 'r')' and 'open(gtf_file, 'r')', which are input files containing genomic data.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is written or transmitted; the code primarily processes input files locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input through parsing functions, converting file lines into data structures, with no data being sent elsewhere or used in insecure ways.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic present. The parsing functions handle expected input formats without executing external commands or handling sensitive data insecurely.",
  "analysis": "The code reads files specified by input parameters, processes line-based data, and constructs in-memory data structures. It performs data validation such as skipping comment lines and ensuring minimum field counts. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external network communication occurs. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent. The only potential concern is if the input files are maliciously crafted to cause resource exhaustion or errors, but this is a typical aspect of file parsing and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for parsing genomic annotation files with no malicious behavior detected. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities beyond typical input validation considerations. It appears safe for use in genomic data processing pipelines.",
