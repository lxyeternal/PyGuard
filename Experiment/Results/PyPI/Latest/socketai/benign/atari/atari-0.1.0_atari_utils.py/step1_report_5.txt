{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse BED and GTF files to extract genomic regions and features such as genes, exons, transcripts, and CDS annotations.",
  "sources": "File openings using 'open(bed_file, 'r')' and 'open(gtf_file, 'r')', reading lines from these files.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data beyond standard file parsing; no network operations or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input files are read line-by-line, parsed, and stored in data structures; no data flows into external systems or insecure processing pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The functions perform straightforward file parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical file reading and parsing routines for genomic data files. It processes each line carefully, skips comments, handles different attribute formats, and converts coordinate systems appropriately. There are no dynamic code executions, no network calls, and no data leaks or malicious logic. The code is well-structured and standard for bioinformatics data parsing tasks, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data parsing utility for BED and GTF files with no malicious behavior detected. It does not contain any malware or security risks, and it appears safe for use in its intended context.",
