  "conclusion": "The code is a typical genomic data parser with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It operates safely within its scope, with minimal inherent security risk primarily related to resource exhaustion in edge cases. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious features justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score."
