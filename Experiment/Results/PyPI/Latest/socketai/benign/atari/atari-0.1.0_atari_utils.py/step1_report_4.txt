{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse BED and GTF files to extract genomic regions and features, and compute total region sizes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input files specified by the parameters 'bed_file' and 'gtf_file'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems, nor does it execute untrusted code or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input file paths -> file open/read operations -> data parsing and processing; no external network or system modification occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present. No dynamic code execution or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code opens and reads files, processes line-based genomic data, and stores structured information in memory. It performs standard file parsing routines with appropriate checks for line content and format. No untrusted data is executed or transmitted. It uses straightforward parsing for BED and GTF formats, handling attributes and feature extraction in a typical manner. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard file parsing for bioinformatics data with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
