  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'atari' for distribution on package repositories like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input from README.md -> long_description; package metadata -> installation process; entry point 'atari.cli:main' -> command line execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The script is a standard Python packaging configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and reads a Markdown README file for the long description. It configures package metadata including name, version, author, and license. Dependencies are specified for installation, and a console script entry point is defined for CLI access. All components align with typical Python packaging practices without suspicious or malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It solely facilitates packaging and distribution of the software with no evident intent of malicious activity.",
