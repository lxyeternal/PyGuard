  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'atari' used for visualization in bioinformatics.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; importing packages and modules; package metadata and requirements.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data output or external connections.",
  "flows": "Reading README content -> defining setup configuration -> no untrusted data flow or external actions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; standard setup.py structure; no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file for long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. All components are standard for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It simply prepares the package for distribution with specified dependencies and entry points.",
