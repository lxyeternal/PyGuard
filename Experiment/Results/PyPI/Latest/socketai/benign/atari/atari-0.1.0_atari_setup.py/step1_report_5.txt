{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'atari' Python project, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description; no untrusted input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure actions. The code primarily defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The setup script appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' functions for packaging, reads a README file, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted input is present. The dependencies listed are common scientific libraries, and no credentials or secrets are embedded. The script conforms to typical Python packaging practices with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
