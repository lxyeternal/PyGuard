{
  "purpose": "The code provides genomic data visualization, plotting gene annotations, allele counts, coverage, and ratios from DataFrames and gene feature dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from pandas DataFrame columns (e.g., 'CHROM', 'Window_start', 'Window_end', 'Mean_depth', 'Mean_ref_reads', 'Mean_alt_reads') and gene features from 'gtf_features'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs plots locally as image files or displays them; no external network communication or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Processes data from input DataFrames, filters features within view regions, and renders plots with gene annotations, allele counts, coverage, and ratios, without external data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external code execution detected. The code is well-structured and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard genomic visualization utility, performing data filtering, plotting with matplotlib, and optional saving/displaying. It contains no network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The plotting routines are complex but benign, focusing solely on visual representation. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The code handles data safely, with no signs of code injection or external dependencies that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured genomic visualization script with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It performs local data processing and plotting without external communication or malicious intent.",
