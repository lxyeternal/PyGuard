{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate detailed visualizations of allele counts, coverage, and gene annotations across different chromosomes and BAM files for genomic data analysis.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the provided DataFrame 'df', including columns such as 'CHROM', 'Window_start', 'Window_end', 'Mean_depth', 'Mean_ref_reads', 'Mean_alt_reads', and optionally 'Bam_file'. It also reads gene features from 'gtf_features'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs plots via matplotlib functions, saving to a file if specified, or displaying them interactively. No data is sent over the network, written to files outside the specified path, or stored in a suspicious manner.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input DataFrame to plotting functions, which process and visualize the data. The gene annotation plotting function reads from 'gtf_features' and annotates the plots. The plotting functions generate visual outputs based on input data without executing or passing data to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code constructs. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or obfuscated language features. The plotting functions are well-structured and do not contain hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review indicates that the code primarily focuses on data visualization for genomic analysis. It processes input data, formats axes, overlays multiple layers (coverage, ratios, gene annotations), and optionally saves or displays plots. All operations are typical for such visualization tasks. No external network calls, hidden code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's logic is clear, with appropriate use of matplotlib for plotting, and no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate genomic data visualization script, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely processes input data and generates visual outputs without performing any harmful or unauthorized actions.",
