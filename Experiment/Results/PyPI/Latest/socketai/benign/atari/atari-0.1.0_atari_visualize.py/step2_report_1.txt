  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code behavior, potential vulnerabilities, malicious indicators, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward genomic data visualization script, plotting gene annotations, allele counts, coverage, and ratios. It reads from DataFrames and gene feature dictionaries, outputs plots, and contains no network or system modification activities.\n\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is primarily for visualization, with no signs of malicious behavior. The detailed review confirms the absence of backdoors, obfuscated code, or external data exfiltration.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The confidence is high (1.0).\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a standard visualization utility with no suspicious activity. The confidence is slightly lower (0.95), possibly due to the complexity of plotting code.\n\n- **Analysis:** The report rightly notes the absence of network activity, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration. The security risk is minimal (0.05).\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.05. These seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a visualization tool with no external connections or malicious intent. The confidence is 0.95, with a slightly higher security risk (0.1), perhaps due to the extensive plotting routines.\n\n- **Analysis:** The detailed reasoning confirms no malicious behaviors. The code handles data safely, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. This is consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard genomic visualization script, with no suspicious activity. Confidence is 0.9, and security risk is 0.1.\n\n- **Analysis:** The review correctly notes the absence of malicious behaviors, with standard plotting and data handling.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code reads data from DataFrames and gene features, produces plots, and does not perform network or system modifications. The analysis confirms no malicious activity, with high confidence (1.0).\n\n- **Analysis:** The detailed reasoning supports the conclusion that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. These are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code's nature, a malware score of **0** is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports assign **0**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.05 to 0.1) are reasonable, considering the code's complexity and plotting routines. Since the code does not perform external calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration, these low scores are justified.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, well-structured code)\n- **Risk:** **0.05** (minimal, mainly due to the extensive plotting logic, but no real security concern)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured genomic visualization script with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are consistent with this conclusion.",
