{
  "purpose": "The code generates detailed visualizations for allele counts, coverage, ratios, and gene annotations from genomic data, primarily for data analysis and presentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the input DataFrame (df) including columns 'CHROM', 'Window_start', 'Window_end', 'Mean_depth', 'Mean_ref_reads', 'Mean_alt_reads', and 'Bam_file'. It also reads gene features from an optional gtf_features dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to files or network connections; it primarily produces visual outputs via matplotlib and optionally saves plots to specified file paths.",
  "flows": "Data flows from DataFrame computations (e.g., calculating ratios, midpoints) into plotting functions. User inputs such as output filename and plotting parameters influence file saving and display, but do not alter data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior are present. The code uses standard plotting and data processing methods, with no obfuscated language features or hidden dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of visualization functions that process input data to generate plots. It uses standard Python and matplotlib features, with clear separation of data processing and plotting. No external network calls, system modifications, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The logic appears straightforward, with appropriate handling of data bounds, annotations, and plot configurations. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage, such as data exfiltration or harmful system modifications, are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign visualization utility designed for genomic data plotting. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. Its functions are consistent with intended data visualization tasks, with no suspicious activity detected.",
