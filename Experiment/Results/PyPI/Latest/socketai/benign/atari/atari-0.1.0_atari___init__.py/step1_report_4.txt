{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a visualization tool for genetic data analysis, specifically for displaying allele read information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from core, visualize, and utils modules; no data input reading or untrusted sources directly in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data transmission, file writing, or system commands are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink is observable in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements and a version string; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Python module with imports from local packages, defining functions for allele counting, visualization, and file parsing. It includes no executable code beyond imports and a version identifier, which is standard. No data leaks, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign module setup for genetic data visualization.",
