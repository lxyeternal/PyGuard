{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a visualization tool for allele read data, likely used in genomic analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from local modules: core, visualize, and utils, which may read data or files when invoked.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data output points are visible; the code only contains import statements and version definition.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable from this snippet since it only contains import statements; actual data processing occurs elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module import and version declaration for a bioinformatics visualization package. It imports several functions presumably for processing and plotting genomic data, and sets a version string. No input reading, data handling, or suspicious behavior is evident at this stage. Since this is only the initial part of the package, the potential for malicious activity depends on how the imported functions are implemented, which is not visible here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no apparent malicious intent or security issues in this snippet. It simply imports functions from local modules related to allele visualization and sets a version. No malicious or security risks are identifiable from this code alone.",
