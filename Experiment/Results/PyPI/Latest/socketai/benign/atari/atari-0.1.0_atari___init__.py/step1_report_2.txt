{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for a genomic data visualization tool called ATARI, which includes importing core processing functions, visualization functions, and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the same package: core, visualize, utils; no external input reading in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling evident in this snippet; no output or network operations shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is apparent in this code fragment; it mainly contains imports and a version declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports functions from local modules and sets a version string. No data processing, input reading, or output generation occurs here. The code appears to be part of a larger package intended for genomic data visualization, with no signs of malicious activities or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard package initialization code with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It simply imports necessary modules and defines a version. No signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
