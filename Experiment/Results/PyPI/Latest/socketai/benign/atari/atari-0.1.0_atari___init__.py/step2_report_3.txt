  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is just import statements and a version string; no data processing, I/O, or external communication.\n- **Assessment:** No issues present. The report correctly identifies the code as safe and benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. These are appropriate given the code snippet.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the lack of external input/output and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly concludes safety; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Slightly more cautious, noting that imported modules may read data or files, but no direct evidence in this snippet.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity is visible, but the potential depends on the imported modules' implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The small securityRisk score seems to reflect the possibility that imported modules could do something malicious, but in this snippet, there's no concrete evidence. This is reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, with a focus on the benign nature of the code.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others; only import statements and version info.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The assessment is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree there's no malicious code in this snippet. Since the code only contains import statements and a version string, the malware score should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree on this.\n- **Risk Score:** The only point of contention is the small securityRisk score in Report 3 (0.1). Given that the code only imports local modules and does not perform any operations, this risk score seems slightly overstated. The risk could be elevated if the imported modules are malicious, but there's no evidence here.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should be **0**.\n- The **obfuscated score** should be **0**.\n- The **securityRisk score** should be **0**, given the lack of any suspicious activity or code.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- Since the code is purely import statements and a version string, there is no immediate security concern.\n- The overall confidence in safety is high (close to 1), as all reports agree on benign nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the evidence and the logical analysis of the code snippet provided.",
