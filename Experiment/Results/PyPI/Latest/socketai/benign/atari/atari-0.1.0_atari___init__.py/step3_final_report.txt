  "purpose": "Module setup for a bioinformatics allele read visualizer, importing core functions, visualization tools, and utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.core, .visualize, .utils) and version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only module imports and version declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version declaration with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules and a version string. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, network communication, or external data handling. The code is typical for a Python package's initialization or API setup. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or near zero) are consistent with the code's benign nature. Slightly cautious scores like 0.1 for security risk are acceptable but could be lowered to 0 given the lack of any suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
