  "purpose": "This module appears to be a visualization and processing tool for genetic data related to alleles, possibly used in bioinformatics workflows.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: core, visualize, utils; no external input sources directly in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this code snippet; no untrusted data handling or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data processing flows are visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The version string is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from local modules, likely part of a larger package. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as network communication, file manipulation, or obfuscated logic. The module mainly contains import statements and a version identifier. Without additional code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard module definition with import statements and a version tag, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe based on the provided content.",
