{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a bioinformatics visualization tool called ATARI, intended to analyze and visualize allele read data.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .core, .visualize, .utils; no external data sources or input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or network communication; the code does not execute external commands or handle untrusted inputs explicitly.",
  "flows": "The code structure only includes import statements and a version assignment, with no data flow or processing logic shown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated segments, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package module.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules and a version string, indicating it's a package initialization or API interface. There are no functions, data processing, or I/O operations that could introduce security issues or malicious behavior. The imports suggest functionality related to allele counting and visualization but do not involve execution of untrusted data or external commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import setup for a bioinformatics visualization package with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be safe and legitimate.",
