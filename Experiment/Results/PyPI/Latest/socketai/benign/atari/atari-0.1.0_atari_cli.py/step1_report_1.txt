{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to analyze BAM files for allele counts at specified genomic regions, then visualize the results.",
  "sources": "Reads input BAM files, reference genome, BED files, GTF annotations, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Outputs results to a TSV file; generates plots and saves images; sets environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input files are read at various points (parse arguments, process regions); data flows into processing functions; results are written to output files; plots are generated and saved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; environment variable 'XDG_RUNTIME_DIR' is set to a fixed path, which is benign; no suspicious code behaviors like network calls or reverse shells; no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports local modules for processing, plotting, and parsing; sets a fixed environment variable; performs input validation, including checks for file existence and index files; processes regions from BED or command-line parameters; supports detailed and windowed outputs; generates plots with optional gene annotations. All operations are typical for bioinformatics pipelines. No obfuscated language features, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are present; the code appears clean and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard bioinformatics tool for allele counting and visualization, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It reads inputs, processes data, and produces outputs in expected ways without suspicious activities or backdoors.",
