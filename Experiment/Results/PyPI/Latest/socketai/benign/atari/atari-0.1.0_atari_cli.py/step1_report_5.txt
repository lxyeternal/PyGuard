{
  "purpose": "The script is designed as a command-line tool to analyze BAM files for allele counts at specified genomic regions, generate visualizations, and output the results in TSV format.",
  "sources": "Input sources include BAM files, reference genome files, optional BED and GTF files, and command-line arguments for regions and filters.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs include TSV files with allele counts and optional visualization plots; no data is sent over the network or written to system files outside specified outputs.",
  "flows": "Input files are read at the start; user parameters influence processing functions like process_regions and process_windows; results are written to output files; visualization functions generate image files. No untrusted data is used in sensitive operations like code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code sets environment variables and creates directories dynamically, which is standard; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code uses relative imports, which is normal in package contexts; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution is evident. The environment variable 'XDG_RUNTIME_DIR' is set to '/tmp/runtime-dir' and the directory is created, which is benign. No hidden backdoors or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to be a typical bioinformatics command-line utility, with comprehensive argument parsing, validation, and modular processing steps. It imports from internal modules for core processing and visualization, handles file existence checks securely, and provides detailed help and usage instructions. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as network communication, system modification beyond creating a directory, or secret data collection, is found. The environment variable modification is within a temporary directory and does not pose security risks. The code does not contain obfuscated patterns or malicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured bioinformatics analysis tool with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It handles input validation properly, performs expected functions, and does not exhibit suspicious behavior.",
