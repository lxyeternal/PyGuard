{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to analyze BAM files for allele counts at specified genomic regions, generate visualizations, and output results in TSV format.",
  "sources": "Reads input BAM files, reference genome, optional BED, GTF files, and command-line arguments for region specification and filters.",
  "sinks": "Outputs TSV result files, optionally generates and saves plots, and may parse and process GTF annotations for visualization.",
  "flows": "Input files are read for region and sample data; filters are applied; results are computed and stored; optionally, visualizations are generated based on processed data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Environment variable 'XDG_RUNTIME_DIR' is set to '/tmp/runtime-dir', which is a common temporary directory but not inherently malicious. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard command-line argument parsing, input validation, region parsing, and data processing for genomic allele counting. It sets an environment variable to a temp directory, which is a common practice for runtime configuration. The functions imported from other modules are assumed to perform typical bioinformatics tasks. There are no indicators of malicious intent such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor behavior. All operations are consistent with expected data analysis workflows. The only notable action is setting 'XDG_RUNTIME_DIR' to a temp directory, which is common in temporary runtime setups but could be used to influence environment-dependent behavior if misused; however, no such activity is evident here.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate bioinformatics tool for allele counting and visualization, with no signs of malicious code or sabotage. It handles data input, validation, processing, and output in a standard manner without suspicious operations.",
