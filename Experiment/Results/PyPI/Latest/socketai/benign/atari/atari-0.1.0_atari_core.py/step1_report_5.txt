{
  "purpose": "This code processes genomic data from BAM files and reference genomes, counting alleles at specified regions and summarizing results in windows.",
  "sources": "Input BAM files, reference FASTA files, and regions data. Reads from BAM files using pysam. Fetches chromosome data from files.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows or code sections directly execute untrusted input in a manner that could cause harm or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Input files are read for genomic data; results are aggregated into DataFrames for further analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. No unusual or malicious behaviors detected. Use of external libraries (pysam, tqdm, rich) is standard for bioinformatics workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard genomic data processing, opening BAM and FASTA files, performing pileup analysis, and aggregating results. Checks are in place for chromosome existence. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious data handling. No network operations, file modifications, or data exfiltration methods are present. The code appears legitimate and aligns with typical bioinformatics practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for allele counting in genomic regions with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It does not perform any harmful actions, data exfiltration, or covert operations. Overall security risk is very low.",
