  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured bioinformatics tool for allele counting and regional summarization. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
