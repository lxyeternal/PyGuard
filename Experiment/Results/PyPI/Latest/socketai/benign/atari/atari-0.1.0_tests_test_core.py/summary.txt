  "conclusion": "The code review indicates that benign scripts are correctly scored with low malware and risk levels, while scripts exhibiting malicious patterns are appropriately scored higher. The use of eval/exec, hardcoded IPs, and unvalidated inputs are key indicators of malicious intent, justifying the higher malware and risk scores. No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are justified and consistent."
