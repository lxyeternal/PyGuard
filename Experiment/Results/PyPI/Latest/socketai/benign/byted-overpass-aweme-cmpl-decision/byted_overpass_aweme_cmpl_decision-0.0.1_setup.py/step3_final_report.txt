{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python package setup script used as a placeholder to mitigate dependency confusion risks.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description, accesses package metadata such as name, version, author, url, classifiers, and Python requirements.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform any data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script only reads a local file and sets package metadata without dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder author details ('Your Name', 'your.email@example.com') is typical for placeholders, not suspicious; no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as a benign placeholder package. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The purpose aligns with best practices for dependency management, and no security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script serving as a placeholder to prevent dependency confusion. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
