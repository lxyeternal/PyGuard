  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package setup, primarily serving as a placeholder to mitigate dependency confusion risks.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; input parameters for setup function such as package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> Pass data to 'long_description' in setup; no other data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder author details ('Your Name', 'your.email@example.com'), which are non-malicious placeholders but could be considered suspicious if unexpected. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated content present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, including package discovery and metadata. It reads a README.md file to include a long description, which is typical. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. All inputs and outputs are typical for a setup script. The code does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or code execution beyond standard package configuration. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup configuration script used for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
