{
  "purpose": "The code performs data extraction from an Excel file, transforms the data by cleaning and feature engineering, saves the processed data to CSV, and visualizes revenue trends over time.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'Ecommerce+Sales+Data.xlsx' and 'transformed_data.csv'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include 'transformed_data.csv' and generated plots for revenue over time.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading Excel -> data transformation -> saving CSV -> reading CSV for visualization -> plotting revenue trends.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with standard data processing steps. Minor unclosed triple-quote at the start appears to be a formatting typo, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical ETL and visualization script using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. It reads data, parses dates with error handling, calculates revenue if columns exist, fills missing values, adds temporal features, and visualizes revenue trends. No suspicious code, obfuscation, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is correct, and no security vulnerabilities are evident. The data handling is standard, and the code does not include any hardcoded credentials or external network calls. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard data analysis script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
