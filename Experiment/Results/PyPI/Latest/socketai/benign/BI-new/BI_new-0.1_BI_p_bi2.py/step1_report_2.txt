  "purpose": "The code performs data extraction, transformation, and visualization on an e-commerce sales dataset.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'Ecommerce+Sales+Data.xlsx' and writes output to 'transformed_data.csv'. Reads the same CSV for visualization.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities. No network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data is read from an Excel file, processed, saved as CSV, then re-read for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors identified. The code appears standard for ETL and visualization tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical ETL operations: reading an Excel file, transforming data by adding columns and handling missing values, saving to CSV, and visualizing data using seaborn and matplotlib. No malicious functions or obfuscated code are present. No external network calls or sensitive data access are observed. The code seems intended solely for data analysis purposes, with no indications of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a standard data processing and visualization tool with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads data from a file, processes it, and visualizes the results without any suspicious or malicious actions.",
