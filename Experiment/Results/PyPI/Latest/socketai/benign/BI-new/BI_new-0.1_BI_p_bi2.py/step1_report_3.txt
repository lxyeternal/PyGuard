{
  "purpose": "The code processes an e-commerce sales dataset by reading, transforming, and visualizing the data, ultimately saving the transformed data to a CSV file.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'Ecommerce+Sales+Data.xlsx' and the transformed CSV file 'transformed_data.csv'.",
  "sinks": "Writes transformed data to 'transformed_data.csv'. No other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads input Excel file -> processes data -> saves to CSV file; Reads CSV file for visualization -> generates plots.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are present. The code is straightforward data processing and visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and visualization tasks using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. It reads data from a specified Excel file, processes date and numerical columns, handles missing data, and saves the output. It then reads the saved CSV to generate plots. No untrusted input handling, no external network connections, no credential use, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The code does not contain obfuscated constructs or malicious behavior. It is standard data analysis code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard data processing and visualization tool without any malicious intent. There are no indicators of malware, suspicious data leaks, or malicious behavior. It appears to be legitimate data analysis code.",
