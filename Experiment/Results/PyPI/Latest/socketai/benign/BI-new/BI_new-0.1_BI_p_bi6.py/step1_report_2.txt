{
  "purpose": "The code performs KMeans clustering analysis on the Iris dataset, including data loading, standardization, clustering, visualization, and evaluation of the optimal number of clusters.",
  "sources": "Loads the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets, reads dataset features, and uses data for clustering and visualization.",
  "sinks": "Outputs cluster assignments, plots, and prints to the console; no data is sent externally or to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading to feature extraction, standardization, clustering, and visualization. No untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. External library 'kneed' is used for elbow detection, which is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads the Iris dataset, standardizes features, computes inertia for k=1 to 10, identifies the optimal k using KneeLocator, performs KMeans clustering, visualizes results, and computes silhouette scores. All steps are typical for clustering analysis. No malicious or suspicious activity observed. External library 'kneed' is used properly. No evidence of data leakage, backdoors, or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate clustering analysis script without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses common libraries and functions for data analysis and visualization. No suspicious patterns or malware indicators are present.",
