{
  "purpose": "The code performs data analysis and clustering on the Iris dataset using KMeans, including data preprocessing, determining the optimal number of clusters via the elbow method and silhouette score, and visualizing the results.",
  "sources": "Imports libraries for data loading, preprocessing, clustering, visualization, and automatic elbow point detection; loads Iris dataset; reads data from dataset and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include printed cluster comparisons, optimal cluster number, silhouette score, and plotted graphs; no untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from the Iris dataset; scaled; inertia is computed for each k; optimal k determined via KneeLocator; KMeans is run with optimal_k; cluster labels assigned; visualizations generated; results printed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of KneeLocator for automatic elbow detection is typical; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected; no code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard clustering analysis on a public dataset using well-known libraries. It calculates inertia for k values, applies an automated method to find the elbow point, and visualizes clustering results. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation, is present. All imported libraries are standard for data science workflows. Variables and functions follow expected patterns, with no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. The script appears to be a legitimate data analysis pipeline with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data analysis and clustering script using open-source libraries on a public dataset. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain sabotage. It is safe to use.",
