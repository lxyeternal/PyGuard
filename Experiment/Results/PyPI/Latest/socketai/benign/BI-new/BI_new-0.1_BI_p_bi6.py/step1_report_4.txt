  "purpose": "This script performs data analysis and clustering on the Iris dataset using k-means clustering, including visualization and evaluation metrics.",
  "sources": "Imports libraries for data loading, preprocessing, clustering, visualization, and automatic elbow point detection; loads Iris dataset; reads data from these libraries and variables.",
  "sinks": "Uses clustering methods and plotting functions; no untrusted data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Reads dataset and library functions as sources; processes data through standardization and clustering; visualizes results; evaluates metrics; no external data or untrusted outputs that could lead to leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The code uses a standard data science workflow with added automatic elbow detection which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a well-known open-source dataset (Iris) from sklearn, processes it with standard methods, and visualizes results. The 'KneeLocator' import, although not used correctly before its initialization of 'optimal_k', is from a reputable library and used for plotting. No suspicious code, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected. The flow is typical for data analysis, with no network or system manipulation. The only issue is the usage of 'optimal_k' before its assignment, which is a logic error but not security-related.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data analysis script for clustering the Iris dataset. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The only notable issue is a logical error with 'optimal_k' usage which does not impact security.",
