{
  "purpose": "Perform clustering analysis on the Iris dataset, including elbow method and silhouette score evaluation, with visualization of clusters.",
  "sources": "Reads Iris dataset from sklearn, standardizes data, computes inertia for k=1..10, uses KneeLocator for optimal k, and applies clustering based on optimal_k.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include print statements, plots, and cluster labels added to DataFrame; no external data transmission or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading -> standardization -> inertia calculation -> elbow detection -> clustering -> visualization -> comparison with actual labels.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'optimal_k' before assignment, leading to a logical bug causing potential runtime error; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard clustering analysis with appropriate use of libraries. The main issue is the premature use of 'optimal_k' before it is assigned, which would cause a runtime error but is not malicious. No external untrusted data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical data science practices. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero; security risk is minimal (0.1) due to the bug but not a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard clustering analysis with a minor logical bug that does not pose security risks. No signs of malware or malicious intent are present. Correcting the bug will improve code correctness but does not affect security assessment.",
