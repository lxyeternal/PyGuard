{
  "purpose": "This code performs KMeans clustering on the Iris dataset, visualizes the clusters, and determines the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method and Silhouette score.",
  "sources": "Reads data from sklearn.datasets.load_iris(), reads data from pandas DataFrame, and imports external libraries for plotting and clustering.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data to files, network, or external systems. No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks; all data sources are trusted and internal, and results are only displayed or printed.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports 'kneed' library for automatic elbow point detection, which is legitimate. The variable 'optimal_k' is used before its assignment, indicating a bug but not malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads the Iris dataset, standardizes it, calculates inertia over a range of cluster counts, and then uses KneeLocator to find the optimal k value. It then fits KMeans with the optimal k, assigns cluster labels, visualizes the clusters, compares them with actual species, and computes the Silhouette score. The code appears to perform standard clustering analysis without any suspicious or malicious behaviors. The premature use of 'optimal_k' before assignment is a bug but does not suggest malicious intent. No external data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data analysis script for clustering the Iris dataset. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The only notable issue is a bug where 'optimal_k' is used before being assigned, which would cause a runtime error. Overall, the script appears safe.",
