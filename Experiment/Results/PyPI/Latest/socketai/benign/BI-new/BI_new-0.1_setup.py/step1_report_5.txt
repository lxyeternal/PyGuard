  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'BI_new' with its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments. The code appears straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It contains no user input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file operations that could be exploited. The dependencies listed are common and necessary for package functionality. The presence of author contact info and repository URL is typical and not suspicious. Overall, the code is benign and follows typical Python packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a normal, non-malicious configuration for a Python package. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is a safe and standard package definition file.",
