  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard, benign Python setup script.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The dependencies are common scientific libraries.\n- The URL is a placeholder, which is typical in template code.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk score is 0 across all reports.\n- The confidence is high (1), indicating the reviewers are certain about their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it's a straightforward `setup.py` using `setuptools`.\n- No issues with the code's logic, security, or malicious intent are evident.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code are present.\n- No untrusted input or data flows are involved.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- There are no logical errors or security flaws in the code.\n- The only minor note is that the URL is a placeholder, but this is common in template code and not malicious.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate; no security risks are evident.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No reason exists to assign higher scores given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe package setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the detailed reviews, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is benign, with no malicious or security issues. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No further action needed.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to prepare a summarized report or further analysis.",
