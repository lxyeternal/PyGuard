{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration for distributing a BI educational package.",
  "sources": "User input is primarily in the form of package metadata and dependencies listed in the install_requires array.",
  "targets": "The code itself does not directly process untrusted input or data; it primarily sets up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "The setup script reads package requirements and metadata, and then proceeds with packaging and installation routines. No untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or unusual patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script utilizes standard setuptools functions to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It specifies dependencies on common scientific Python packages. The URL is a placeholder but not malicious. There are no signs of malicious code or malicious behavior, nor any code execution, network activity, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malware or security risks. All code appears benign and typical for a Python package distribution.",
