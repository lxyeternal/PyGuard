{
  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'BI_new' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata, including name, author info, description, URL, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the setup script solely processes static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard setup procedures without unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to define package setup parameters, including metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All data used is hardcoded, static, and typical for package configuration. No code execution, network activity, or dynamic data handling occurs. The URL is a placeholder and not suspicious. The dependencies listed are common scientific Python libraries. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It only contains package metadata and dependency declarations, all of which are typical and safe.",
