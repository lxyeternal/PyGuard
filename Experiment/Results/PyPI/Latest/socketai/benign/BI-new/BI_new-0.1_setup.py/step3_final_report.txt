  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; placeholder URL is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools with static metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. All signals indicate a benign, standard package configuration. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
