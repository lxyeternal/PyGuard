{
  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'BI_new' for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "The code sources are primarily static data such as package name, author info, description, URL, and dependencies specified in the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities; the setup script is straightforward and static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution are present. The URL is a placeholder, but that's not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' functions to define package metadata and dependencies. It does not contain any input handling, dynamic code execution, or network operations. The dependencies are standard for data science and machine learning projects, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a normal, benign package configuration for distributing a Python educational package. It poses no security threats or malicious behavior based on its content.",
