  "purpose": "The code performs data analysis and modeling on the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using logistic regression. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the file 'titanic.csv' using pandas.read_csv().",
  "sinks": "Outputs include print statements for data inspection, model evaluation metrics, and visualizations generated by matplotlib and seaborn. No data is sent over the network or stored maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data is read from a local CSV file, processed, split into training and testing sets, and used for model training and evaluation. Results are printed and visualized locally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. The code uses standard libraries and methods for data analysis and machine learning. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a dataset, performs typical data cleaning and feature engineering, and applies logistic regression with hyperparameter tuning. It produces several visualizations for data insights and model evaluation. The code appears standard for a data science workflow, with no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data analysis and modeling script without any malicious or malicious-looking elements. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration activities. All operations are related to legitimate data science tasks.",
