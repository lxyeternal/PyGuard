  "purpose": "The code performs data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization on the Titanic dataset.",
  "sources": "Reads 'titanic.csv' via pandas.read_csv() from local storage.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include print statements, model evaluation metrics, and visualizations; no external data transmission or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local CSV to pandas DataFrame, through preprocessing steps, into model training, then to evaluation and visualization outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard data science pipeline with clear, well-structured steps. It uses common libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib) in typical ways. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by local file access and standard operations. The code does not contain any suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation. All reports' assessments align with this analysis, confirming the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data analysis and modeling script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
