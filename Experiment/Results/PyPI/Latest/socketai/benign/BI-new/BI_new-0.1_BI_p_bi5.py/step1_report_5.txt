  "purpose": "Data analysis and model training on the Titanic dataset for survival prediction, including visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV file 'titanic.csv'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or external network communication. No sensitive data output or storage observed.",
  "flows": "Reads data from file -> processes and analyzes data -> trains model -> generates plots and reports.",
  "anomalies": "None detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. All code appears typical for data analysis and modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and visualization tasks. It uses common machine learning libraries and methods, with no signs of malicious behavior. No network connections, data exfiltration, or suspicious obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward, with typical use of pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib. No anomalies like hidden backdoors or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, standard data analysis and modeling code for the Titanic dataset. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It operates within expected parameters for such a task.",
