{
  "purpose": "The code performs data analysis and predictive modeling on the Titanic dataset, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Data is read from a local CSV file 'titanic.csv'. No external inputs or untrusted sources are explicitly used within the code.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include printed data summaries, model evaluation metrics, plots, and visualizations. No data is written to external or sensitive locations, nor are there network transmissions.",
  "flows": "The data flows from reading 'titanic.csv' into pandas DataFrame, undergoes preprocessing, is split into training and test sets, then used for model training, prediction, and evaluation. Visualizations are generated from the dataset and model results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden functionalities. The code adheres to typical data analysis workflows. No obfuscated or suspicious dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a CSV dataset, performs standard preprocessing (missing value imputation, encoding, feature engineering), trains a logistic regression model with hyperparameter tuning, evaluates it, and generates various plots for data insight. No external or malicious code, network activity, or obfuscated behavior is present. It is a typical data science pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data analysis and modeling script with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no suspicious behavior detected. Overall security risk is minimal.",
