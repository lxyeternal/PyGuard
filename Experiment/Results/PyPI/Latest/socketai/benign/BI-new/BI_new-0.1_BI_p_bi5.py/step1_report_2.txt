{
  "purpose": "The code performs data analysis and modeling on the Titanic dataset to predict survival outcomes using logistic regression, including data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'titanic.csv' via pd.read_csv(). Uses user-defined functions and standard sklearn methods for model training and evaluation.",
  "sinks": "Predicts and outputs model performance metrics; visualizes data using matplotlib and seaborn; does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Data read from 'titanic.csv' (source) is processed and used to train a model; predictions are made and evaluated locally; visualizations are generated locally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors; all libraries are standard and used as intended.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a dataset, performs standard data preprocessing, feature engineering, and scaling. It trains a logistic regression model with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV, then evaluates and visualizes the results. All operations are typical for data analysis and modeling. No external data transmission, backdoors, or malicious actions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data analysis and machine learning workflow with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses common libraries and practices for predictive modeling and visualization without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
