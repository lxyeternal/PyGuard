{
  "purpose": "The code performs data analysis and modeling on the Titanic dataset, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'titanic.csv' file using pd.read_csv(). No other external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include printing data summaries, model performance metrics, and displaying multiple plots. No untrusted data is written to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data is read from the CSV, processed, and then used to train a machine learning model. Model predictions and evaluation metrics are computed locally. Visualizations are generated locally.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward for a typical data analysis pipeline; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual logic is observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard data analysis libraries, loads a dataset, performs typical cleaning, encoding, feature creation, and scaling. It then trains a logistic regression model with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. The code evaluates model performance and generates several plots for data insights. All operations are consistent with standard practice. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads, are present. No suspicious external network calls, hidden processes, or encoded payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data analysis and modeling script for Titanic dataset with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to serve its intended purpose without any malicious or sabotage behaviors.",
