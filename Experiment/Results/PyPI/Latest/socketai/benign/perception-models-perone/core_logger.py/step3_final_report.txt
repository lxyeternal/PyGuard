{
  "purpose": "Provides a custom logging formatter and setup for distributed systems, formatting logs with timestamps, system rank info, and optional file output.",
  "sources": "External functions get_global_rank() and get_is_slurm_job() for system info; standard logging input/output streams.",
  "sinks": "Logs are written to stdout, stderr, and optionally a file; no untrusted data sources or external network activity.",
  "flows": "Log messages flow from code to output handlers; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward custom logging setup with a formatter that adds timestamps and system rank info. It uses external functions for distributed environment context but does not process untrusted input or perform network operations. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on external functions and distributed context, which are standard in such setups.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured logging utility for distributed systems. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behaviors are present. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
