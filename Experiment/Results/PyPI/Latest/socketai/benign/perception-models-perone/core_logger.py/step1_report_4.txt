{
  "purpose": "The code configures a custom logger for distributed systems, with specialized formatting for log messages, including timestamps and rank information.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the global rank and job type from core.distributed, and log file name and logger name parameters.",
  "sinks": "Log messages are output to stdout, stderr, and optionally to a file if specified and if the global rank is zero.",
  "flows": "Input data from core.distributed flows into log formatting functions, which then output formatted logs to different handlers (stdout, stderr, file).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No unusual code execution patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard logging setup with custom formatting. It uses standard libraries and functions to handle logging levels, output streams, and file handling. No external or untrusted data inputs are processed beyond standard parameters. No suspicious or malicious operations, such as network activity, data theft, or code injection, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a custom logging system for distributed applications. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks based on the provided content.",
