{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom logging setup for distributed systems, including a custom formatter, level setting, and initialization of log handlers for console and file output.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters such as log level, log file path, and logger name; it also retrieves system information via get_global_rank() and get_is_slurm_job().",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; logging outputs are to stdout, stderr, and optionally a file, none of which process untrusted external input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence logger configuration; the formatter generates timestamped and rank-included log messages for output handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code relies on external functions (get_global_rank, get_is_slurm_job) but these are standard for distributed setups; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a logging framework with custom formatting, supports multi-handler setup (console and file), and adjusts levels dynamically. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or dangerous operations. External functions used are related to distributed job info and are unlikely to be malicious. No data leaks, code injections, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup for distributed Python applications, with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It primarily manages log formatting and output, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
