  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, suspicious functions, and potential vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, configuration files, and system calls.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system operations, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points ('eval', 'exec'), and system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or environment variables flow into functions like 'eval', 'exec', or network modules, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic code execution functions ('eval', 'exec') without validation, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits standard patterns with no explicit malicious payloads. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected. Dynamic execution functions are present but used in a context that appears justified; however, their presence warrants caution. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed. The code's structure and behavior suggest benign intent, with potential minor security concerns related to untrusted input handling and dynamic code execution. Confidence in benignity is high unless dynamic execution is misused without validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity. The primary concern is the use of dynamic code execution functions, which should be used cautiously, especially with untrusted inputs. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible.",
