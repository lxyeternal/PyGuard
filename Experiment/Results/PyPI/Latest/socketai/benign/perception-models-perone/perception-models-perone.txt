      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cluster job submission utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The slightly elevated risk score reflects the use of subprocess with shell=True and user prompts, but these are standard practices in such scripts. Overall, the security posture is acceptable, with minor cautions regarding subprocess usage."

It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the scoring in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) is appropriate and consistent with its functionality."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent debugging and profiling utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It poses minimal security risk, primarily potential data leakage if logs are mishandled. The current malware score of 0 and low risk score (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with its purpose."
