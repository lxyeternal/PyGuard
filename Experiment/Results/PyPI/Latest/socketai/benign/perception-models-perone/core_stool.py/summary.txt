  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cluster job submission utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The slightly elevated risk score reflects the use of subprocess with shell=True and user prompts, but these are standard practices in such scripts. Overall, the security posture is acceptable, with minor cautions regarding subprocess usage."
