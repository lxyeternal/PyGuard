  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent debugging and profiling utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It poses minimal security risk, primarily potential data leakage if logs are mishandled. The current malware score of 0 and low risk score (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with its purpose."
