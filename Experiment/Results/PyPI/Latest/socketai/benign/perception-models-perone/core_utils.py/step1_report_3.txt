  "purpose": "Defines initialization functions for PyTorch tensors, supporting Gaussian and uniform distributions with configurable parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (args, input_dim, init_depth) for get_init_fn; class InitArgs for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Returns a partial function for torch.nn.init methods, which initialize tensors with specific distributions.",
  "flows": "Function get_init_fn takes parameters, computes std, and returns a tensor initialization function based on the distribution type.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. No code injection or insecure data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for tensor initialization in PyTorch. It calculates standard deviations based on input parameters and returns partially applied init functions. Usage of torch.nn.init functions is standard, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No external data sources or untrusted input flows are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. All operations are typical for model weight initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for tensor initialization in PyTorch without any malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
