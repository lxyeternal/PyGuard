  "purpose": "Provides neural network weight initialization functions supporting Gaussian and uniform distributions with configurable parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: args (configuration), input_dim, init_depth; calculations based on these inputs.",
  "sinks": "Returns a torch.nn.init function (trunc_normal_ or uniform_) that initializes tensors; no external data or untrusted inputs used.",
  "flows": "Input args and parameters influence std and bounds; these are used to configure the returned initialization function applied to tensors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class for configuration and a function that computes initialization parameters based on input dimension, optional depth, and configuration flags. It uses standard mathematical formulas for std and bounds, and employs torch's initialization routines via partial application. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are present. The logic is clear, well-structured, and relies solely on standard libraries. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for neural network weight initialization. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
