  "purpose": "Define a function to generate initialization functions for neural network weights with configurable parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: args (InitArgs), input_dim, init_depth; data used within the function for calculations.",
  "sinks": "Returned callable functions that initialize torch tensors, potentially affecting model weights.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> internal calculations -> returned initialization functions applied to tensors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; use of standard libraries and safe mathematical operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class and a function to generate weight initialization functions for neural networks. It calculates standard deviation based on input dimensions and optional parameters. It supports Gaussian (truncated normal) and uniform distributions, with parameters derived from mathematical formulas. No obfuscated code, suspicious data handling, or external network calls are present. The code appears to be standard, safe, and intended for model setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard neural network weight initialization without malicious intent. No malware or security risks detected. It’s a typical implementation for model parameter setup.",
