{
  "purpose": "Provides various tokenizer implementations (Byte, Mock, SentencePiece, TikToken) for processing text into tokens and vice versa, primarily for NLP applications.",
  "sources": "Reads model files from disk, input text for tokenization, and uses external libraries for model processing.",
  "sinks": "No external network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input text and model files flow into tokenizer methods; tokenized output is returned. No external or malicious data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple tokenizer classes supporting different tokenization strategies, all of which operate on provided inputs and models. No network activity, external data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code uses standard libraries and practices, with safe file handling and clear structure. No obfuscation or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of NLP tokenizers with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
