      "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign test script for uploading a file via a third-party library. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security concern is the insecure handling of credentials and local file paths, which should be addressed in production. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is low to moderate. The scores in the critical reports are consistent with this analysis."
