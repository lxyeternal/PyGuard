  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal entry point for a Python package or module, importing the main function and executing it when run directly.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .main import main; the __name__ == '__main__' check.",
  "sinks": "The call to main() which executes the imported function.",
  "flows": "Import of main from local module -> execution of main() when script runs as __main__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and execution; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python entry point pattern. It imports a main function from a local module and executes it if the script is run directly. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of main(), which is outside this snippet. The code is simple, clear, and benign. The risk and malware scores should be zero, as there is no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the minimal and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python entry point with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The overall security risk is negligible, and no modifications to the scores are necessary based solely on this snippet.",
