  "purpose": "Entry point that imports and executes the main function from a local module.",
  "sources": "The local module '.main' imported at the beginning.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() function when script is run as main.",
  "flows": "Import statement → main() invocation when __name__ == '__main__'.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'main' function from a relative module and executes it if the script is run directly. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior observed. It appears to be a typical entry point for a Python package or script. The code is minimal and standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard entry point with no malicious behavior or security issues identified. It simply runs the main function from a local module when executed directly.",
