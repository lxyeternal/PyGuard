{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to run the main function from the main module when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the execution context (via __name__ == \"__main__\") and imports main from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code only invokes a function, with no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing main and calling it if the script is executed directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical entry point that imports a main function from a local module and executes it if run directly. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or external data handling is present. The structure is standard for Python scripts, and there is no obfuscation or malicious intent detectable in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign Python entry point script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
