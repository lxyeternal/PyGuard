  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for executing a main function from a local module, likely to run the application or script.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it simply imports and calls a function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or where sensitive data might be leaked.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: when executed, it calls main() from the local module, with no data flow involving external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The import statement uses a relative import, which is standard in package modules.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python entry point that imports and executes a main() function if run as the main program. It contains no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It does not handle or process untrusted input directly, nor does it contain any obfuscated or complex code. There are no signs of malware or security risks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a standard script entry point. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
