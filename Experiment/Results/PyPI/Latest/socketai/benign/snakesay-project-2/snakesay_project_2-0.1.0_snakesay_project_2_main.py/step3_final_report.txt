  "purpose": "A minimal Python script that prints a static greeting message.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data sources, or untrusted data read; static code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, clear, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a main() function that prints a static message and executes it if run directly. It contains no external data handling, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code. All reviews correctly identify its benign nature. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, with full confidence (1). The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores or assessment are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
