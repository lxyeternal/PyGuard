{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to print a greeting message to the console.",
  "sources": "The only source is the script execution itself; there are no external inputs or data reads.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data beyond standard printing.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and minimal, with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a main function that prints a static message. It then checks if the script is executed as the main module and calls main(). There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no manipulation of environment variables or files. The code is simple, clean, and does not contain any obfuscation or hidden malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performs a simple print operation, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
