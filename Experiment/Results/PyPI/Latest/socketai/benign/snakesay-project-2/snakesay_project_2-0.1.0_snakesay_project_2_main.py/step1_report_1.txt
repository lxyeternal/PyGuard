  "purpose": "The code is a simple script that prints a greeting message to the console.",
  "sources": "The code reads data only from the program's internal logic, specifically the string to print.",
  "sinks": "The print function outputs data to the console; no untrusted data is used or processed.",
  "flows": "There is no data flow from external sources to critical functions; the code executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a main() function that prints a fixed message. The __name__ == '__main__' check ensures main() runs only when executed directly. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network operations, and no security-sensitive actions. The code is straightforward and lacks any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign script that outputs a static message. It contains no malicious behavior, no malicious code, and poses no security risks.",
