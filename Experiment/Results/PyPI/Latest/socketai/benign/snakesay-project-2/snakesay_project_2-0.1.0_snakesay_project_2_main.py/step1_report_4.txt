  "purpose": "A simple script that outputs a greeting message to the console.",
  "sources": "User input is not read; no external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "The print function outputs data to the console, which is not a security concern here.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a main() function that prints a greeting message. When executed as a script, it calls main(). There are no external inputs, no network activity, no file operations, and no sensitive data handling. The code appears to be a benign example or placeholder with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It simply prints a static message and terminates.",
