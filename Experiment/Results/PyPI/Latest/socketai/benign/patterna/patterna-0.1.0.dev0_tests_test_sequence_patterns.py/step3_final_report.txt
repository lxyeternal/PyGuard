{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple test functions that generate Python functions as strings, execute them with exec, and then use the patterna.match function to analyze or invoke these functions, primarily testing pattern matching features.",
  "sources": "String definitions of code snippets executed via exec within each test function.",
  "sinks": "The exec function executing controlled code snippets; no external data or network sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Code snippets -> exec execution -> pattern matching via match function -> assertions verifying behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious activity; use of exec is controlled and limited to static, hardcoded code snippets within test functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of controlled tests for pattern matching features, with all dynamic code execution confined to static, predefined strings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks. The use of exec in this context is typical for testing and does not pose a security risk. The patterna.match function is from an external library and used appropriately. The overall structure and behavior are benign, with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, intended for testing pattern matching capabilities, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The use of exec is controlled and typical for such testing scenarios. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2 due to exec usage, which is acceptable in this context.",
