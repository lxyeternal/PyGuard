  "conclusion": "The code is safe, intended for testing pattern matching capabilities, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The use of exec is controlled and typical for such testing scenarios. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2 due to exec usage, which is acceptable in this context."
