  "purpose": "Set up a Point class and make it available globally and via a module for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements (pytest, sys); class definition; modifications to globals() and sys.modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted input to critical points",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically adds the Point class to globals() and sys.modules, which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or malicious logic observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Point class intended for use in tests, adds it to the global namespace, and injects it into a custom module in sys.modules. All actions are related to test setup and do not involve any external data, user input, or suspicious behavior. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious activity is evident. The code appears to be for organizing test fixtures rather than malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for testing with pytest, involving class definition and module manipulation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks present.",
