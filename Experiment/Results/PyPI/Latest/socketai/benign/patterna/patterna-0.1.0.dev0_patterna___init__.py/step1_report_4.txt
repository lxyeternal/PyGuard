{
  "purpose": "The code exports a function 'match' and imports 'match' and 'PatternMatcher' from local modules, likely for pattern matching purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: '.matcher' and '.patterns'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Importing functions/classes and exporting 'match' via __all__ does not establish data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of import and export statements. It does not process or handle data directly. No external input handling, no sinks, and no evident malicious behavior. The pattern suggests a module setup for pattern matching, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No anomalies or suspicious activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module export for pattern matching functionalities. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
