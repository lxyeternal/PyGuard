{
  "purpose": "The code exports a 'match' function for external use, likely as part of a larger pattern matching library or module.",
  "sources": "Imports 'match' from a local module '.matcher' and 'PatternMatcher' from '.patterns'. No data input or external data reading is directly performed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident in this snippet; it's a module that exposes an interface without executing any logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports components and defines what symbols are exported. It contains no data processing, logic, or runtime behavior. Its simplicity reduces the likelihood of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup for exporting a 'match' function, with no signs of malicious intent or security concerns. It is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
