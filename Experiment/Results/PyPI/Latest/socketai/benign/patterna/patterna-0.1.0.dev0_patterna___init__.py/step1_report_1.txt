{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define an API for a module, exposing a 'match' function and importing a 'PatternMatcher' class, likely for pattern matching functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from .matcher and .patterns modules, specifically 'match' and 'PatternMatcher'. No external or untrusted input handling is visible.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present; no data is being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is evident in this code; it is solely defining module exports and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports functions and classes from internal modules and defines __all__ to specify public interface. There are no operations involving data processing, input/output, or external communication. No signs of malicious activity or security issues are detectable within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module interface definition with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign part of a larger pattern matching library.",
