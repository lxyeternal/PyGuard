{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or interface, exposing the 'match' function for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports 'match' from '.matcher' and 'PatternMatcher' from '.patterns'. No data input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects, as there is no data processing or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exposes symbols without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing only imports and defining '__all__' to expose 'match'. It contains no data processing, external communication, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify it as a benign module setup. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, with full confidence, aligning with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign module interface with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
