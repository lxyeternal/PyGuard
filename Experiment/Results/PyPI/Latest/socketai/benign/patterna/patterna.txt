The main security concern is the use of 'exec', which could be risky if inputs are untrusted. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware score at 0 and a moderate security risk score around 0.2-0.6 depending on context. Overall, the code is safe within a controlled environment, but caution should be exercised if inputs are untrusted."

The scoring accurately reflects the lack of evidence, with low risk scores appropriate given the cautious analysis. No significant revisions are necessary; current scores are appropriate and aligned with the evidence."
