  "purpose": "This code provides functions for analyzing, improving, and generating passwords, including entropy calculation, pattern detection, and strength evaluation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'password' in calculate_entropy, check_common_patterns, get_password_improvement_suggestions, generate_secure_password, and evaluate_password_strength.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data beyond local processing; no data leaks or external network communications are performed.",
  "flows": "The functions process input passwords internally, analyzing patterns, entropy, and strength without external data flow or output streams that could leak data.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'random' module for password generation could be considered less secure compared to cryptographically secure functions like 'secrets'. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden code. No external data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard password analysis, including entropy calculation, pattern detection (sequential characters, keyboard patterns), and strength evaluation. It also generates passwords using the 'random' module. The logic is conventional, with no unusual constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious code segments. All functions operate locally, and there is no network activity or external data handling. The password generator does not rely on cryptographically secure methods, which could be a concern in high-security contexts, but it does not pose malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical password analysis and generation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It does not leak data, connect externally, or perform any harmful actions. The only minor concern is the use of 'random' instead of 'secrets' for password generation, but this is not malicious. Overall, it appears safe and purely utility-oriented.",
