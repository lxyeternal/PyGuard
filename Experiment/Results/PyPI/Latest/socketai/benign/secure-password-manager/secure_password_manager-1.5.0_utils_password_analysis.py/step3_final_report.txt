  "purpose": "Provides password analysis, suggestions, and generation functionalities, including entropy calculation and pattern detection.",
  "sources": "Input password string for analysis and generation functions; internal pattern detection and entropy calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; internal computations only.",
  "flows": "Input password -> pattern detection and entropy calculation -> suggestions or generation -> output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'random' module instead of 'secrets' for password generation; minor hardcoded exception for specific password case.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard password analysis and generation tasks with clear, straightforward logic. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The pattern detection (sequences, repeated characters, keyboard patterns) and entropy calculations are correctly implemented. The use of 'random' for password generation is a known security best practice concern but not malicious. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential security considerations. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident. The minor security concern does not elevate the malware or overall risk scores, which remain low.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor security consideration is the use of 'random' instead of 'secrets' for password generation, which is acknowledged but does not constitute malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
