  "purpose": "The code performs a security audit of stored passwords by evaluating their strength, detecting reuse, duplicates, expiry, and breaches, and calculates an overall security score.",
  "sources": "get_passwords() function retrieving password entries; decrypt_password() decrypting stored passwords; analyze_password_security() checking breaches; time.time() for expiry; data stored in local variables and in-memory structures.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through the analyze_password_security() function if it transmits data; in-memory data processing; logging functions; no explicit network transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Password data is retrieved, decrypted, evaluated for strength and breach status; password reuse and duplicates tracked in memory; breach analysis potentially external; data flows from retrieval -> processing -> reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; use of try-except to handle errors silently; breach check limited to 10 passwords to limit API calls; the breach analysis call is wrapped in a broad except block, potentially hiding errors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform standard password security auditing tasks. It reads data from a database, decrypts passwords, evaluates their strength, checks for reuse, duplicates, expiry, and breaches, and computes an overall score. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful actions is detected. The use of a limited breach check demonstrates cautious external API usage. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The broad exception handling around breach analysis could hide errors but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code seems legitimate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate password security auditing tool with no apparent malicious intent. It performs standard checks and calculations related to password health. No suspicious or malicious behaviors were identified. The security risks are low, and the code appears safe for use.",
