{
  "purpose": "Performs password security auditing including strength evaluation, reuse detection, expiry check, breach analysis, and duplicate detection.",
  "sources": "Retrieves encrypted passwords from database, decrypts them, and analyzes for security issues.",
  "sinks": "Internal processing only; no external data transmission or exfiltration detected.",
  "flows": "Password data flows from database retrieval -> decryption -> analysis functions -> issue detection and scoring.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling around breach analysis; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code executes standard password security checks: evaluates password strength, detects reuse and duplicates, checks expiry, and performs breach analysis via limited API calls. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling is broad but not malicious; it may hide errors but does not indicate malicious intent. External modules are typical; no network activity outside breach checks. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are consistent with the code's benign, security-focused purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate password security auditing tool with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
