  "purpose": "Provide logging utilities for a password manager, including log message functions and log file management.",
  "sources": "LOG_DIR creation, LOG_FILE path, functions reading log files and renaming/deleting log files.",
  "sinks": "Reading log file contents in get_log_entries(), renaming or deleting log files in clear_logs().",
  "flows": "Log message functions write to log via logger; get_log_entries() reads from log file; clear_logs() renames or deletes log file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious logic. Log management appears standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution. No code injecting data into other processes.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a straightforward logging utility with functions to log info, warnings, errors, and debug messages. It manages log files by creating a logs directory, writing to a log file, and providing functions to retrieve recent entries or clear logs with optional backup. The code handles file operations with exception handling but does not process or transmit untrusted data beyond reading log files or renaming/deleting files locally. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. All functions serve legitimate purposes related to log management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility for a password manager with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It manages log files and provides access to recent logs in a safe manner. No security risks or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
