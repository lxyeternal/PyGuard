  "sources": "File system (checking and creating log directory and log file), reading log file contents, renaming or deleting log files.",
  "sinks": "Reading from log files, renaming or deleting log files, logging messages.",
  "flows": "Log message functions -> write to log file; get_log_entries -> read log file; clear_logs -> rename or delete log file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Standard logging and file operations. No suspicious input handling or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard logging functionality with methods to log info, warning, error, and debug messages. It manages log files by creating, reading, and clearing them, with an option to backup logs before clearing. All operations are typical file I/O and logging practices. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. No external network communication, no handling of sensitive data beyond logs, and no suspicious code constructs observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate logging utilities with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs typical file and logging management tasks for a password manager. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
