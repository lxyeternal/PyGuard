  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and minimal security risk (~0.1) are justified based on its straightforward implementation and safe operations."
