  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a password manager, reading metadata and dependencies from external files.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md, VERSION.txt, and requirements.txt files to gather description, version, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Uses collected data in setup() configuration; no untrusted data execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "External files are read into variables and passed directly to setup(), with no dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Handles missing files gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with straightforward file reads and package configuration. No dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscation present. Dependencies are standard for a password manager. The external file reads could be manipulated if files are compromised, but this is a common supply chain consideration, not an active vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured setup configuration with no malicious intent or behavior. The minor security risk score reflects potential external file tampering, which is outside the code's scope. Overall, the code is safe and free from malicious activity.",
