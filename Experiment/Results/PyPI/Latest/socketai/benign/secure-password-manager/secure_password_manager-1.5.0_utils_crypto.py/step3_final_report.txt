{
  "purpose": "The code provides password encryption and decryption using symmetric cryptography, with key management via file storage and optional derivation from a master password.",
  "sources": "Reads salt from 'crypto.salt', reads or generates key from 'secret.key', inputs include passwords and optional master password for derivation.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted passwords output; decryption outputs plaintext passwords; file reads/writes for salt and key.",
  "flows": "Input passwords are encrypted using a key derived from stored key or master password; salts are loaded or generated; encrypted data is returned; decryption reverses this process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard cryptographic practices; storage of key and salt files on disk is typical but could pose security risks if permissions are lax.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements cryptographic best practices: uses Fernet for symmetric encryption, PBKDF2 for key derivation with a salt, and manages salt and key files appropriately. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The main security concern is the local storage of keys and salts, which is a common risk but not an active vulnerability in the code itself. Error handling during decryption is appropriate, and no obfuscation or network activity is present. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and security considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of password encryption/decryption with proper cryptographic practices. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present. The primary security consideration relates to local key and salt storage, which is a typical risk but not an inherent flaw. The scores across reports are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
