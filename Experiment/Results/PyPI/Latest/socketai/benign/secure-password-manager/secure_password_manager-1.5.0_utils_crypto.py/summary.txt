  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of password encryption/decryption with proper cryptographic practices. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present. The primary security consideration relates to local key and salt storage, which is a typical risk but not an inherent flaw. The scores across reports are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."
