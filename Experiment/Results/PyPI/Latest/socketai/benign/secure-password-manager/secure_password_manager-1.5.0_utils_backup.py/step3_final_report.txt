{
  "purpose": "Provides backup, restore, export, and import functionalities for a password manager, handling encrypted password data and associated files.",
  "sources": "Reads from the database, encrypted files, and configuration files; writes encrypted data to files and archives.",
  "sinks": "Writes encrypted JSON files, backup ZIP archives, and copies of sensitive files; reads from database and files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from database and files to encrypted JSON during export; from encrypted files to database during import; from files to ZIP archives during backup; and vice versa during restore.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; encryption functions are external and assumed secure.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard backup and restore operations with proper encryption, file handling, and exception management. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. External modules are presumed secure. The data flow is typical for such utilities, and no signs of malicious activity or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of backup and restore utilities for a password manager. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects the handling of sensitive data but remains low. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy.",
