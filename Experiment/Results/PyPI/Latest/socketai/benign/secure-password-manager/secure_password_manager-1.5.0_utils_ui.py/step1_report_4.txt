{
  "purpose": "The code provides UI utility functions for printing formatted headers, messages, menu options, and tables in a command-line Password Manager application.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data only through function parameters (title, message, key, description, headers, rows). No external or untrusted input sources are used within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to the console via print statements. These outputs are only from predefined parameters and are not influenced by external or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The functions take parameters and display them; there is no data manipulation from external inputs or network sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code uses standard library functions and well-defined third-party library functions (colorama) for output formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes the colorama library for colored terminal output. It defines several utility functions to print headers, success/error/warning messages, menu options, and data tables, all formatted with colors. All inputs are parameters explicitly passed to functions, and no external data is fetched or processed insecurely. The code is purely for display purposes and contains no malicious commands, network activity, or data handling that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward UI utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only outputs formatted text to the console based on function parameters. No vulnerabilities or malicious functionalities are present.",
