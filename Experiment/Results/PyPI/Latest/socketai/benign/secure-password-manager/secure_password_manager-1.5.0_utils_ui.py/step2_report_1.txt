  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward UI utility functions with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  None detected. The logic is clear, and the functions serve their purpose.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct, no malicious activity.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — Appropriate, no security issues.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct, code is clear.\n\n- **Comments:**  \n  The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Again, purely UI functions with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — Slightly above zero, but given the benign nature, perhaps slightly conservative.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n\n- **Comments:**  \n  The slight security risk score (0.1) might be overly cautious, but not unreasonable considering the use of colorama. No change necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. No suspicious activity detected.\n\n- **Errors?**  \n  None.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — Appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n\n- **Comments:**  \n  The report is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No.\n\n- **Errors?**  \n  None.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n\n- **Comments:**  \n  The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No.\n\n- **Errors?**  \n  None.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is benign UI formatting functions.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, no obfuscation present.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1. Given the code's nature, a score of 0 or very close to zero is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard set of console UI utilities, with no network, file, or data processing beyond formatting output. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The slight security risk score in one report is conservative but acceptable given the context.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is safe, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores should be uniformly zero across malware, obfuscated, and security risk categories.",
