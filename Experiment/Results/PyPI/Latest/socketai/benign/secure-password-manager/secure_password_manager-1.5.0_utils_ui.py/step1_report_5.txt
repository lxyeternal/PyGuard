  "purpose": "The code provides UI utility functions for printing formatted headers, messages, menu options, and tables in a password manager application.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code only outputs formatted text to the console.",
  "sinks": "Console output functions such as print(), which display messages and tables.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process untrusted input to produce output; it mainly displays static or parameterized messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The use of colorama is standard for colored console output. No obfuscated or suspicious code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports colorama for colored terminal output, initializes it, and defines multiple functions for printing headers, success, error, warning messages, menu options, and tables. All functions accept parameters for dynamic content and format output accordingly. There is no input parsing, data processing, network activity, or credential handling. The code's structure is straightforward, focusing solely on output formatting. No security issues, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for user interface formatting and display in a terminal environment. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and intended for enhancing user experience through colored and formatted console messages.",
