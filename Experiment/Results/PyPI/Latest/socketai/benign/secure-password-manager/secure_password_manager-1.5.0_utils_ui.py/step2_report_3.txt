  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of UI utility functions that use the 'colorama' library to print styled messages, headers, menus, and tables.\n- Inputs are strictly function parameters; no external or untrusted data sources are read.\n- Outputs are console print statements with styling; no files, network, or environment variables are written or read.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n- The code appears straightforward, benign, and solely for UI purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  **No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are detected.** The code is purely for formatting and displaying UI elements.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws, Errors, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n\n- **Logical or reasoning errors:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is for UI formatting, with no malicious intent or security risks. They consistently note the absence of suspicious behavior, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature. Security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1—this is reasonable considering the minimal risk involved in console UI code.\n\n- **Potential overestimation:**  \n  The only minor point is the report that assigns a security risk of 0.1. Given the code's simplicity, this is perhaps slightly overcautious, but not unreasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation, which is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Scores > 0.5:\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n  None are assigned higher than 0.1, which is appropriate. The code's benign nature warrants very low risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Claims Based on Assumptions:\n\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's behavior as purely UI formatting.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — minimal to no security risk, given the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe code is safe, with a malware score of **0**, obfuscated score of **0**, and a security risk score of **0**. No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that in future assessments, if any external data sources or dynamic code execution are introduced, the scores should be revisited accordingly.",
