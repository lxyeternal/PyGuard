  "purpose": "Provide UI utilities for formatting and displaying messages and data in the Password Manager application.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the function parameters: title, message, key, description, headers, rows.",
  "sinks": "Output functions like print() and colorama's Fore/Style output to the console; no untrusted data is written to files, network, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters to print statements, with formatting applied, then output to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Use of colorama for UI styling is standard. No dynamic execution or obfuscation evident.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for cross-platform terminal coloring, then defines several functions to print headers, success/error/warning messages, menu options, and tables with formatted output. The functions accept parameters such as strings, lists, and optional color specifiers, then produce styled console output. No external data sources or sinks, no user input reading, nor network interactions. The code is straightforward and intended solely for UI display purposes, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for user interface display and formatting, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior observed. It performs standard terminal UI tasks without any suspicious or malicious activities.",
