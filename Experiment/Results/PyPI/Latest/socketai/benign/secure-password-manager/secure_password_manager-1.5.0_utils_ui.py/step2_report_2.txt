  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of UI utility functions for console output, utilizing colorama for styling.\n- Inputs are only parameters; no external data sources, file I/O, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.\n- No evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** UI utilities for formatting and displaying messages.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; functions are straightforward, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely for UI display.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** UI utility functions, similar to others.\n- **Analysis:** Consistent; no malicious behavior, standard use of colorama.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 — this seems slightly high given the code's benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable, but perhaps slightly overestimated.\n\n**Verdict:** Consider lowering `securityRisk` to 0, as there's no actual risk. The only reason it might be slightly elevated is the use of colored output, which is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** UI utilities, same as others.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** UI utilities, similar.\n- **Analysis:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** UI utilities, same.\n- **Analysis:** Clear, safe, standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign UI utilities.\n- The malware score is appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score is zero, matching the straightforward code.\n- The security risk score is mostly zero; the only exception is report 2, which assigns 0.1.\n\n**Given the code's simplicity and lack of any malicious or suspicious behavior, I recommend:**\n\n- **Security risk scores** in reports 2 should be lowered from 0.1 to **0**, aligning with the actual risk profile.\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores** are correct at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis: the code is purely for UI formatting, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n- All reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- The only adjustment is to lower report 2's `securityRisk` from 0.1 to 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to prepare a summarized report with these recommendations.",
