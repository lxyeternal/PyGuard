  "purpose": "Provide UI utility functions for displaying headers, messages, menus, and tables in a password manager application.",
  "sources": "User input sources are not explicitly read in this code; data is passed via function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Output functions that print formatted messages to the console; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters to print statements, with no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'colorama' library for colored console output, initializes it, and defines multiple functions for printing headers, success, error, warning messages, menu options, and tables. All functions process input parameters and print formatted text with color styling. There is no user input handling, no external data fetching, no command execution, and no dynamic code evaluation. The code appears to be standard UI utility code with clear and straightforward logic. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as UI utilities for printing styled console messages and tables. It does not include any malicious or suspicious behaviors and poses no security threats.",
