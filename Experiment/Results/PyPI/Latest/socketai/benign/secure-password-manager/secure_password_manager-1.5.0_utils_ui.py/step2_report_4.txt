  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of UI utility functions for printing headers, messages, menu options, and tables with color formatting.\n- Uses the 'colorama' library for cross-platform terminal coloring.\n- Functions accept parameters and output formatted text via print statements.\n- No user input reading, file/network I/O, dynamic code execution, or data processing beyond formatting.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- No external data sources or sinks besides console output.\n- The code appears straightforward, benign, and solely for UI display.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n**Presence of issues in the code:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign malware score 0. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign obfuscated score 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign very low or zero security risk (mostly 0, one report 0.1). Given the code's nature, this is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere are **no issues or malicious behaviors** present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws, reasoning, or mistakes in reports:\n\n- **No flaws or mistakes detected.** All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and solely for UI formatting.\n\n---\n\n### Score review and suggestions:\n\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, consistent with the code content.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, correct given the code clarity.\n- **Security risk:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's harmless nature.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nNo changes needed; scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Risk justification:\n\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is purely for UI formatting with no security-sensitive operations, a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is justified.\n- **Higher than 0.5?** No, the highest is 0.1, which is acceptable. No justification for higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n\n- The reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis, which is reasonable.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are warranted here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent.** They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a standard UI utility module, with no suspicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security-sensitive operations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
