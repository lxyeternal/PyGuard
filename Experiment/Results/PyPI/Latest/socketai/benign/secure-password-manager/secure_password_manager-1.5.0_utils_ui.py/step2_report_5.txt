  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of UI utility functions for console output, primarily using the `colorama` library.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior, no external data handling, and no malicious intent.\n- The functions accept parameters and output formatted text, with no user input parsing, network activity, or file operations.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The security risk score is low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which seems appropriate given the code's scope.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n- **Logical errors or flaws:** None detected; the code is well-structured and straightforward.\n\n### Evaluation of Scores:\n\n| Report | Malware | Security Risk | Justification for Scores |\n|---------|---------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0              | No malicious code, no external data, purely UI functions. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0.1            | Slightly above zero security risk due to potential misuse of output functions, but no actual vulnerability. The score seems acceptable. |\n| 3       | 0       | 0              | Same reasoning; no issues. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0              | No security concerns. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0              | No concerns. |\n\n**Note:** The small security risk score (0.1) in report 2 might be a conservative estimate, perhaps considering that output functions could be misused if user input were involved. But since no user input or external data is processed, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Concerns or Assumptions:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly note no obfuscation.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are present, as the code is purely for display.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — accurate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — accurate.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0 or 0.1), justified by the code's benign nature.\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0             |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, straightforward UI utility module with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**System Note:** Continue monitoring for any future code involving user input, external data, or dynamic code execution, which could alter the risk profile.",
