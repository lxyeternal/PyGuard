  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into print functions to produce styled console output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard library functions without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple UI formatting functions utilizing colorama for styled console output. It accepts parameters for text content and prints formatted headers, messages, menus, and tables. There are no external data reads, network operations, dynamic code execution, or security-sensitive operations. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent. The minimal security risk score (0 or 0.1) assigned in previous reports is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of UI utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
