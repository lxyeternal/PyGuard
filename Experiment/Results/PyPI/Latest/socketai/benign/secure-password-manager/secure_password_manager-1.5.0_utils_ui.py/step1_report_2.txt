  "purpose": "UI utility functions for displaying formatted messages, headers, and tables in the Password Manager application.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'title', 'message', 'key', 'description', 'headers', and 'rows' inputs, typically provided by the application or user interface logic.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the console via print statements, which display formatted text and tables.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., title, message, table data) flow into print functions that output formatted console text. No data is processed or transmitted beyond local output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, malicious code, or unusual behavior. The code exclusively handles display formatting and output.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions to format and print headers, success/error/warning messages, menu options, and tables with proper alignment and colors. It uses the 'colorama' library for terminal coloring, which is a common and legitimate library for enhancing console UI. The functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, input sanitization issues, or data leaks. There is no network activity, file I/O, or other suspicious behavior. All inputs are simply used to format output text, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for UI display with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be benign, intended solely for enhancing console output formatting in the Password Manager application.",
