{
  "purpose": "Provides interactive CLI components for password input, menu selection, and confirmation prompts.",
  "sources": "User input via input() and getpass.getpass() functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted user input processed within the functions.",
  "flows": "Input functions collect data; no external transmission or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard library functions with straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python functions for CLI interactions without any obfuscation, external network calls, or data leaks. It handles user input securely and simply. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present. The functions are well-structured, with appropriate input validation for their scope. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of CLI utility functions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scoring accurately reflects its safe and standard implementation.",
