{
  "purpose": "Provides interactive command-line interface components for password input, menu selection, and confirmation prompts.",
  "sources": "Input functions: getpass.getpass(), input() for menu choice, input() for confirmation response.",
  "sinks": "Input data potentially processed based on user input; no data is directly written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "User input is collected via getpass.getpass() and input(), then used to determine control flow in menu selection and confirmation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. All functions perform standard input handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three simple user interaction functions: hidden_input uses getpass to securely read passwords, menu_selection displays options and reads user choice, confirm_action prompts for yes/no confirmation. There are no external network calls, no data leakage, or code that could be exploited for malicious purposes. The code relies solely on standard library functions for user input. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, implementing standard CLI input functionalities without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security threats or malware indicators detected.",
