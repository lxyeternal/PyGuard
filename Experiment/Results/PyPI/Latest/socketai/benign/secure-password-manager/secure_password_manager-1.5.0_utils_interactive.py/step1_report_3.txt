{
  "purpose": "Provides an interactive command-line interface with password input, menu selection, and confirmation prompts.",
  "sources": "Input functions: getpass.getpass() for password, input() for menu choices and confirmations.",
  "sinks": "Input functions which could receive untrusted data and could potentially be misused if their output is used insecurely elsewhere.",
  "flows": "User inputs from getpass.getpass() and input() are returned directly; no further processing or external data transmission occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external calls, no unusual or misleading code. The code relies on standard library functions for input.",
  "analysis": "The code offers basic CLI functionalities: hidden password input, menu selection, and confirmation prompts. It uses standard Python libraries without any obfuscated or malicious constructs. There are no network operations, no data exfiltration, and no code injection points. The functions simply gather user input and return values, which can be used elsewhere. No evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior is observed within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It relies solely on standard input/output functions and does not perform any suspicious actions. Overall security risk is minimal.",
