{
  "purpose": "Provides interactive command-line interface components for user input and menu navigation.",
  "sources": "getpass.getpass() for hidden password input, input() for user choices and confirmations.",
  "sinks": "input() calls that receive user input, getpass.getpass() for password input.",
  "flows": "User inputs are collected via input() and getpass.getpass(), which are then used to determine control flow in menu_selection and confirm_action.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious input handling. Functions are standard CLI components.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward CLI utility functions: one for hidden password input, one for menu selection, and one for yes/no confirmation. All input methods are standard Python functions; no processing of untrusted data leads to external effects or data leaks. No data is transmitted externally, no command injections, no use of environment variables, and no obfuscated or malicious code detected. The code appears benign and intended solely for user interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard CLI utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or data leaks. Overall, it appears safe and purposefully designed for user input collection.",
