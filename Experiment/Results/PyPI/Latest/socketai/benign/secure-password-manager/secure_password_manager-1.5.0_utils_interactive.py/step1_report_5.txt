{
  "purpose": "Provide interactive command-line input functionalities, including password input, menu selection, and confirmation prompts.",
  "sources": "Input functions: getpass.getpass() for password; input() for menu choice and confirmation responses.",
  "sinks": "User inputs are read from standard input; no data is sent elsewhere or stored insecurely within the code.",
  "flows": "User inputs flow from input() and getpass.getpass() into the control logic for menu selection and confirmation, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code employs standard input functions without obfuscation or unusual constructs. No malicious behavior or privacy violations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script provides basic CLI utilities: hidden password input, menu selection, and yes/no confirmation. It uses standard Python libraries (`getpass`, `input`) without any external or suspicious calls. There are no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or external network interactions. The structure is straightforward, with proper input validation and prompting. The code does not include any malicious or malicious-sounding behavior. No anomalies or obfuscation are present. It appears as a benign utility module for CLI interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign CLI utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It neither handles sensitive data insecurely nor performs any suspicious operations. The overall security risk is very low.",
