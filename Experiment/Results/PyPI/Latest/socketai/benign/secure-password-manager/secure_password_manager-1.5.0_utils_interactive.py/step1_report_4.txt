{
  "purpose": "Provides interactive CLI components for password input, menu selection, and confirmation prompts.",
  "sources": "Input functions: getpass.getpass() for password, input() for menu choice and confirmation response.",
  "sinks": "Input data potentially affecting program flow or displayed to the user; no untrusted data processed into sensitive sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "flows": "User inputs from input() functions determine program flow, but are confined within the CLI prompts. No data is transmitted externally or used maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. All functions perform standard input/output interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code includes straightforward user interaction functions: hidden_input uses getpass for password input; menu_selection displays options and waits for valid choice; confirm_action asks for yes/no confirmation. All input functions are standard, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or malicious side-effects. No data leaks, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscation or code injection present. The code is typical for CLI utilities and does not perform any harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of CLI utility functions for user prompts. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
