  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for setting up, verifying, and managing two-factor authentication using TOTP.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from 'totp_config.json' and environment (file existence).",
  "sinks": "Reads and writes to 'totp_config.json', generates QR code images, and verifies codes via pyotp.",
  "flows": "Reads secret from config file -> verifies code against TOTP secret -> generates QR code for provisioning -> saves/loads config.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Usage of standard libraries for 2FA. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate 2FA setup and verification using pyotp and qrcode. It securely generates a secret, produces a QR code for user setup, and verifies input codes. Configuration data is stored in a JSON file, and no untrusted data sources or insecure practices are evident. The code handles enabling and disabling 2FA correctly. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, secure implementation of TOTP-based 2FA utilities without malicious intent or security risks.",
