{
  "purpose": "Provide two-factor authentication utilities for generating, verifying, and managing TOTP secrets and QR codes.",
  "sources": "Reading TOTP configuration from 'totp_config.json', reading secret from the config for verification and current code generation.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'totp_config.json', saving QR code images to disk, deleting configuration file on disable.",
  "flows": "generate_totp_secret -> get_totp_uri -> generate_qr_code -> save config -> verify_totp / get_current_totp -> read config from file.",
  "anomalies": "None of the code appears to include suspicious or malicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration observed. Uses standard libraries responsibly.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard 2FA functionality: generating secrets, provisioning URIs, QR codes, verification, and configuration management. It reads and writes configuration data securely within the application scope. No suspicious data handling, external network calls, or obfuscated code present. The only external dependencies are 'pyotp' and 'qrcode', which are standard for such functionality. The code does not include any hidden or malicious code; it performs expected TOTP-related operations. No anomalous patterns or security flaws detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides legitimate 2FA functionality with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It manages secrets and verification processes securely and responsibly, with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
