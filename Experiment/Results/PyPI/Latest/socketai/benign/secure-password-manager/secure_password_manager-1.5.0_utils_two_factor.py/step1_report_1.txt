  "purpose": "Provide utilities for setting up, verifying, and managing two-factor authentication using TOTP.",
  "sources": "Reads and writes configuration data from 'totp_config.json'; reads secret from the config file; reads/writes QR code image file; reads system time for TOTP generation.",
  "sinks": "Writes configuration data to 'totp_config.json'; saves QR code image file; reads secret from file; removes configuration file during disable_2fa.",
  "flows": "generate_totp_secret() -> get_totp_uri() -> generate_qr_code() -> setup_totp() -> verify_totp() and get_current_totp() -> is_2fa_enabled() and disable_2fa()",
  "anomalies": "None observed. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code activities. The code uses standard libraries and APIs properly.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard TOTP setup and verification procedures with no evident malicious intent. It securely generates secrets, creates QR codes, and verifies codes based on a stored secret. It manages configuration securely via a JSON file. There are no backdoors, network communication beyond QR code generation, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The functions for enabling, verifying, and disabling 2FA follow typical patterns. Overall, the code appears benign and intended solely for 2FA management.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides typical 2FA utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely manages secrets and verification processes. No malicious intent or suspicious activities are detected.",
