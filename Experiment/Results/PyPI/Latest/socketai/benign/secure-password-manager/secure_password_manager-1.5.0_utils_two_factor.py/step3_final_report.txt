{
  "purpose": "Implement a standard TOTP-based two-factor authentication utility, including secret generation, QR code provisioning, verification, enabling, and disabling 2FA, with local storage of configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'totp_config.json' for secret and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'totp_config.json', generating QR code image files, verifying TOTP codes against stored secret.",
  "flows": "Generate secret -> create provisioning URI -> generate QR code image -> save config to JSON -> verify user input code against stored secret -> retrieve current TOTP code for testing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets; no network activity; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of TOTP 2FA management, utilizing 'pyotp' for cryptographic functions and 'qrcode' for QR code generation. It securely handles secrets by storing them in a local JSON file, with functions for setup, verification, enabling, and disabling 2FA. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The code does not perform any network operations or data exfiltration. The only minor concern is the local storage of secrets, which is standard for such utilities, assuming proper file permissions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and straightforward implementation of TOTP-based 2FA utilities. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe for use in secure environments.",
