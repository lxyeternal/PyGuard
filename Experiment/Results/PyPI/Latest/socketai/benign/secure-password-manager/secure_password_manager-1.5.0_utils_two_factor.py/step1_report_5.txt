{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for setting up, verifying, and managing two-factor authentication using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password).",
  "sources": "Reads the TOTP configuration data from 'totp_config.json'; reads the secret key from this config file during verification and current code retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Writes the TOTP secret and configuration to 'totp_config.json'; generates and saves QR code images as 'totp_qr.png'; deletes config file during disable_2fa.",
  "flows": "During setup, generates secret, creates URI, produces QR code, and saves config to file. During verification and current code retrieval, reads config file, extracts secret, and verifies or generates current code. Disabling 2FA deletes the config file.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed. All file operations are straightforward. No hardcoded credentials or secrets beyond standard TOTP secret generation. QR code generation uses common libraries. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of TOTP-based 2FA, using standard libraries (pyotp and qrcode). It securely generates secrets, stores configuration in a JSON file, and handles verification and current code retrieval. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors identified. File operations are safe and conventional. The code does not include any network activity, reverse shells, or data exfiltration mechanisms. It does not contain backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This source code implements standard 2FA utilities without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses well-known libraries appropriately and maintains typical security practices. No malware or malicious activity detected. The overall security risk is minimal.",
