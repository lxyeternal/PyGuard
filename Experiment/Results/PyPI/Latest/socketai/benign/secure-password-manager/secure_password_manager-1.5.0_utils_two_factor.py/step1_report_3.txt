{
  "purpose": "Provides utilities for setting up, verifying, and managing two-factor authentication using TOTP.",
  "sources": "Reads the TOTP configuration from 'totp_config.json', reads secret data from the config file, and accesses the filesystem to save QR code images.",
  "sinks": "Writes configuration data to 'totp_config.json', saves QR code images to disk, deletes the configuration file to disable 2FA.",
  "flows": "Generates secret -> creates provisioning URI -> generates QR code image -> saves config; verifies code -> reads config -> verifies TOTP; disables 2FA -> deletes config file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials or secret data present; standard libraries used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements standard TOTP 2FA setup, verification, and management. It uses pyotp for cryptographic TOTP functions and qrcode for QR code generation. Configuration data is stored in a JSON file, which is properly read and written. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unauthorized data exfiltration. File deletion functions are standard for disabling 2FA. Overall, the code performs legitimate security functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of TOTP-based 2FA utilities with no malicious behavior detected. It manages secrets securely by generating and verifying one-time passwords and allows enabling/disabling 2FA via configuration files. No suspicious or malicious activity is present.",
