{
  "purpose": "Provides basic arithmetic operations: addition and subtraction.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' for both functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements output the result; no external sinks are used.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into return statements without validation or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward implementation of arithmetic functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple functions performing addition and subtraction. There are no external data sources, no use of environment variables, no network activity, and no suspicious code constructs. The functions are pure and do not include any malicious or obfuscated behavior. The code does not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to injection or data leaks. Overall, this appears to be benign arithmetic code with no signs of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign implementation of arithmetic functions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
