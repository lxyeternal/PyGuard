There are no external data inputs, no use of environment variables, no network activity, and no suspicious behaviors. The functions are pure and simple, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of basic arithmetic functions with no malicious or security concerns.",
