  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no dynamic execution or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines two basic functions for addition and subtraction without any external input handling, network activity, or suspicious constructs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The functions perform straightforward arithmetic operations with no side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be simple, benign, and intended solely for basic arithmetic. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
