  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:  \n   The original code defines two functions:\n   ```python\n   def add(a, b):\n       return a + b\n\n   def subtract(a, b):\n       return a - b\n   ```\n   There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data sources. The functions are simple, pure, and perform basic arithmetic.\n\n2. **Report Consistency & Validity**:  \n   All five reports correctly identify the functions as straightforward arithmetic operations with no suspicious behavior. They consistently note the absence of external inputs, malicious activity, or obfuscation. The analysis and conclusions in each report are aligned and reasonable.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct. There is no malicious activity or indicators of malware.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which matches the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations**:  \n   Since the code is trivial and benign, any score higher than 0 for malware or security risk would be unjustified. The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the clarity of the code.\n\n5. **Critical Observations**:  \n   - The reports do not overstate the security assessment; they consistently recognize the code as benign.\n   - No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code.\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations**:  \n   - The current scores seem appropriate and reasonable.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the provided reports.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**: The code is a straightforward implementation of addition and subtraction functions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Conclusion**: All scores are justified; no changes needed.",
