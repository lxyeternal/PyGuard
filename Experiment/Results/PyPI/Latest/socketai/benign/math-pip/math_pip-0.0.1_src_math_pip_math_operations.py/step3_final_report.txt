  "purpose": "Simple arithmetic functions performing addition and subtraction, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Function definitions 'add' and 'subtract' operating on input parameters; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions return results directly without external communication or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into return statements; no external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two straightforward functions performing basic arithmetic. No external data sources, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, and scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0. Confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
