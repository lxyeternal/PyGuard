  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple, straightforward functions performing addition and subtraction. There are no external inputs read from files, environment variables, network, or other sources. No data leaks, code injections, or malicious activity is present. The code structure is clear and minimal, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
