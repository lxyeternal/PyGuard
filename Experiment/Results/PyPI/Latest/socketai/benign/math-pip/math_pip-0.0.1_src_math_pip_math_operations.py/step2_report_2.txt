  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of two simple functions performing addition and subtraction, with no external inputs, network activity, or complex logic. The original code matches the described purpose and structure in all reports.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports uniformly state that there are no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. This appears accurate given the code.  \n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning; the analysis is consistent and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - All reports assign `obfuscated: 0`, `malware: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate.  \n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about benignity, which seems justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   - The `securityRisk` and `malware` scores are all 0, which is consistent with the benign analysis.  \n   - Since no malicious or suspicious behavior is detected, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   - The code performs only basic arithmetic with no external data, network activity, or obfuscation.  \n   - The reports correctly assign `malware: 0`.  \n   - No evidence suggests malicious intent, so this score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary of My Evaluation**:  \n- The code is straightforward, benign, and performs only basic arithmetic.  \n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.  \n- The scores are appropriate given the evidence.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:  \n- **Malware Score**: Remain at 0.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: Remain at 0.  \n- **Risk Score**: Remain at 0, as there are no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with the reports:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThere is no indication of malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is negligible.",
