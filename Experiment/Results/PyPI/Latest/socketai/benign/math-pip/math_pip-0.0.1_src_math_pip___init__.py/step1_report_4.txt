  "purpose": "The code provides access to mathematical operations and version information from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: 'math_operations' and 'version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data, no execution of untrusted input, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; just static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement of functions and a version string. There are no dynamic code executions, no network connections, and no handling of untrusted input. It appears to be a standard module setup. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as a module to expose functions and version info. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
