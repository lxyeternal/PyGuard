  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:\n   - The original code consists solely of import statements:\n     ```python\n     from .math_operations import add, subtract\n     from .version import __version__\n     ```\n   - These are standard, internal module imports exposing functions and version info.\n   - No dynamic code execution, no external data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Each Report**:\n   - All five reports consistently describe the code as a benign, straightforward import setup.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no data flows, no untrusted data handling, and no anomalies.\n   - The reasoning in each report is sound, emphasizing the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - Since the code is very minimal and standard, there's no reason to adjust the scores.\n   - The reports do not overstate or understate the risk; they are consistent and accurate.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The malware score is correctly zero, as no malicious activity is evident.\n   - The obfuscated score is zero, aligning with the straightforward code.\n   - The risk score remains at zero, which is justified.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion**:\n   - The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n   - The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n   - The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- No changes needed to the reports or scores.\n- The code should be considered safe and non-malicious.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
