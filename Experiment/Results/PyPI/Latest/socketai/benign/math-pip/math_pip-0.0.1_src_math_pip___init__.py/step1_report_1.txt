  "purpose": "To provide access to mathematical operations (add, subtract) and package version information.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .math_operations and .version",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and variables from internal modules, which is a standard practice for exposing package APIs. No external data input, network operations, or suspicious code behavior is present. The code structure and syntax are straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module import statement for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
