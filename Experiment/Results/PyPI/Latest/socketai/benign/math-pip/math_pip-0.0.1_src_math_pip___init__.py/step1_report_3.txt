  "purpose": "This code imports functions for mathematical operations and the package version, likely for exposing APIs or internal usage.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .math_operations and .version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; primarily module setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward import statements from internal modules and a version attribute. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. It appears to be standard package initialization code that exposes functions and version info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for Python packages, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
