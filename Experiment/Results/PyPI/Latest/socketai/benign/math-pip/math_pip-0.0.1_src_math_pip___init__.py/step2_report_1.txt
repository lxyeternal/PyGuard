  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code and the provided information.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code is a simple set of import statements:\n     ```python\n     from .math_operations import add, subtract\n     from .version import __version__\n     ```\n   - There are no data flows, no input processing, no external calls, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - All reports correctly identify that this is standard package setup code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No logical errors or overlooked issues are apparent.\n   - They correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores**:\n   - Since all reports agree on the absence of malicious behavior, malware score should remain 0.\n   - The risk score is also correctly 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All claims are based on straightforward static imports.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behavior are made; the analysis is sound.\n\n6. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n  The code does not perform any malicious activity, dynamic code execution, or external communication.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n  The code is clear, straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score**: 0  \n  No security risks are present in this static import setup.\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall analysis that the code is a standard, safe package setup snippet.",
