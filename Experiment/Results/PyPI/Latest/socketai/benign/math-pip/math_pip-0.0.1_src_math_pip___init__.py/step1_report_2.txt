{
  "purpose": "The code imports basic mathematical functions and a version identifier from internal modules, likely for exposing these functionalities as part of a package's API.",
  "sources": "The code reads from internal modules: '.math_operations' and '.version'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement setup for a Python package. It imports functions 'add' and 'subtract' from an internal module and the '__version__' string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. It does not process input or perform any operations; it solely makes certain functions and variables available for package users.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign import setup with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply exposes existing functions and version info from internal modules.",
