  "purpose": "Import functions add, subtract from math_operations module and __version__ from version module for package setup or API exposure.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules (.math_operations and .version).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external calls, or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static imports do not process untrusted input or external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward static import statements, typical for package initialization. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0, confidence 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No issues or risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe package setup snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
