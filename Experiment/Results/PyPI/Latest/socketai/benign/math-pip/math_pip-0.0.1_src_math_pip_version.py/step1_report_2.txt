  "anomalies": "No anomalies; very minimal code",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string '0.0.1' to the variable __version__, which is a common practice for package versioning. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external calls, and no suspicious patterns. This is a standard version declaration, typically harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version indicator. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are present.",
