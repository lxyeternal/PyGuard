  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; extremely minimal code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment setting __version__ to '0.0.1'. There are no input sources, data handling, or suspicious constructs. This is a common pattern in Python packages to specify version info. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
