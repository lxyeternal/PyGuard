  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external calls, and no suspicious constructs. This is consistent across all reports.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that this is a minimal, benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. There are no logical errors or flawed reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `obfuscated`: 0  \n   - `malware`: 0  \n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   \n   These are appropriate given the code's simplicity. Since all reports agree, there's no reason to adjust these scores.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any malicious behavior or security risk. The code is standard and benign. Therefore, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   All reports assign `malware` as 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n   No such claims are made. The assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n### Reasoning summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. All reports are aligned, and the scores reflect the code's harmless nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code poses no security threat.",
