  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to __version__, serving as a package version indicator.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a direct assignment of a string to __version__, a common pattern for versioning in Python packages. It contains no inputs, outputs, external calls, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with appropriate scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. There are no anomalies or signs of malicious behavior. The code's simplicity and standard pattern confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
