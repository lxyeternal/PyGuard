  "review": "Let's review the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code only defines a simple custom exception class (`userInputError`) inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious or security-related issues.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (fully confident)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - Since all scores are zero across malware and security risk, there is no need to justify higher scores.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or risky behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they accurately describe the code's behavior.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard Python class defining a custom exception. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n- The code poses no security concern.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0",
