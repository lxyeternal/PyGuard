  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named userInputError inheriting from Exception.",
  "sources": "No data sources; code is a class definition with no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the class is a simple exception definition with no data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with standard syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single class inheriting from Exception, with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward Python class defining a custom exception. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
