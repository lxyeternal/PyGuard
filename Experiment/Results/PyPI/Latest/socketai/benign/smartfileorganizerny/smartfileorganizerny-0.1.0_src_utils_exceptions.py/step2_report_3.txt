  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition inheriting from Exception, with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They all correctly state that the code only defines a custom exception class with no suspicious behavior. No errors or logical flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - **Confidence**: All reports assign a confidence of 1, which seems appropriate given the clarity and simplicity of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated**: All are 0, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.  \n   - **Malware**: All are 0, which is justified as there's no malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk**: All are 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n   The scores appear reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate given the benign code.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a standard, benign class definition for a custom exception. There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.",
