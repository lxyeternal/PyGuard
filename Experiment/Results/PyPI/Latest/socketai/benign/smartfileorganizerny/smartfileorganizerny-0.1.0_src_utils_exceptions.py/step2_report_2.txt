  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code only defines a simple custom exception class `userInputError` inheriting from `Exception`. There are no data sources, sinks, or data flows, and no additional logic or external interactions. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Confidence:** All reports have a confidence score of 1, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.  \n   - **Malware:** All are 0, correctly indicating no malicious intent.  \n   - **Security Risk:** All are 0, aligning with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely a class definition with no external interactions, data handling, or suspicious patterns, a high risk score is unwarranted. The current zero scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct given the benign nature of the code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's content.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThe code is a minimal, standard Python class for a custom exception. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**In conclusion, I agree with the provided scores.**",
