  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for user input errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading functions present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with no hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a custom exception class named 'userInputError' that inherits from Python's built-in Exception. It contains no methods or attributes beyond inheritance. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal, clear, and standard for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign class definition intended to be used for specific error handling related to user input. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
