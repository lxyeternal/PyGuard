  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only defines a simple custom exception class (`userInputError`) inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no signs of data sources, sinks, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or anomalies are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a minimal class definition with no security concerns.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is a simple class definition with no data handling, no external interactions, and no suspicious patterns, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n   - **Conclusion:** The risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on observable code features.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, straightforward class definition with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. Given the code's simplicity, I agree with the provided scores. No further action or concern is warranted for this code snippet.",
