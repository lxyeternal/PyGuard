  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling user input errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; class definition alone does not process data",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward class declaration with no additional logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class named 'userInputError' inheriting from 'Exception'. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. The code appears to be standard Python for creating custom exception types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic class definition for a user input error exception. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious activity, and no security risks identified.",
