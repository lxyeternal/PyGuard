  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or automation, but without specific context or comments, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from environment variables, user input via functions like input(), or external files/read operations. Specific sources are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., socket, requests), file write operations, or subprocess executions. No explicit network or file sinks are observable from the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions, with no clear indication of malicious flow such as data exfiltration or command execution based on the code provided.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code patterns are visible. No unusual or malicious code constructs are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code structure is straightforward, involving standard library usage and no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as system manipulation, data leakage, or malicious network activity. Without further context or external dependencies, the code seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be standard, non-malicious Python script, with no malicious behavior or security threats evident.",
