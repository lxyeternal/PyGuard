  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential input points include hardcoded strings, URLs, environment variables, network endpoints, and dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Data leaks, network communication, file modifications, or system commands that could lead to security breaches or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources such as hardcoded URLs or strings may flow into network functions or dynamic execution modules, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded URLs, potential dynamic code execution points, and generic variable names without clear context. No obfuscation or malicious patterns confirmed.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets across all reports show no definitive malicious activity. The scores for malware are consistently low or zero, aligning with the absence of suspicious patterns. Slight concerns in some reports about hardcoded strings or network endpoints are noted but not confirmed as malicious. The obfuscation scores are zero, indicating no obfuscation detected. Security risk scores are low (around 0.2-0.3), reflecting cautious but justified assessments. Confidence levels are high, and no significant anomalies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The overall evaluation indicates no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the security risk scores are justified given the limited context. Minor adjustments, such as reducing the malware score in Report 3 from 0.1 to 0.05, could better reflect the minimal suspicion. Overall, the reports are consistent and accurate, requiring no major changes.",
