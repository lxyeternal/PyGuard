{
  "purpose": "Set up a logging system that writes logs to a file and outputs colored logs to the console.",
  "sources": "os.path functions, datetime.now(), environment variables (via os), input/output streams (logging handlers).",
  "sinks": "log file on disk, console output.",
  "flows": "Logs are generated and directed to both a file and the console; no untrusted input directly influences the data beyond typical logging.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Use of external library 'colorlog' appears standard for colored logging.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a logs directory based on the script's location, generates a timestamped log filename, configures a logger with both file and console handlers, and applies formatting. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns are evident. The use of os.path to determine log directory is standard; log formatting is conventional. No suspicious network activity or malicious intent observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign logging setup intended for debugging and informational output with color support. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
