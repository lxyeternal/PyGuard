{
  "purpose": "Set up logging configuration with both file and console handlers, including colored output for console.",
  "sources": "os.path and datetime for determining log directory and filename; input file path is derived from __file__; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to a log file and console; no untrusted data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The code constructs paths and configures logging handlers but does not process external or user input data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The use of ColoredFormatter is standard for enhanced console output, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically constructs the log directory path relative to the current file, creates the directory if missing, and configures a logger with both file and console handlers. The console output uses color formatting for improved readability. No external input or untrusted data is processed or transmitted. The code adheres to standard logging setup practices, with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely configures logging outputs with no evidence of malware or suspicious activity.",
