  "purpose": "Set up logging with separate file and console handlers, including colored console output.",
  "sources": "os.path, datetime.now(), environment variables indirectly through __file__ for path determination.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or execution.",
  "flows": "N/A; code primarily for configuration and setup, no untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; uses standard logging setup. No hardcoded credentials or secrets found.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically creates a logs directory based on the script's location, generates a log filename with the current date, and configures a logger with file and console handlers. It clears existing handlers before adding new ones to avoid duplicate logs. Console output is formatted with colors for different log levels. No external inputs or untrusted data are processed, and no code injection or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard logging setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It effectively manages log output, but does not perform any operations that could harm or compromise security.",
