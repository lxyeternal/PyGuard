{
  "purpose": "The code organizes files in a specified folder by type, date, or both, based on user-selected method.",
  "sources": "Reads directory contents via os.listdir(), checks file properties with os.path functions, reads modification times with os.path.getmtime().",
  "sinks": "Moves files with shutil.move(), creates directories with os.mkdir() and os.makedirs(), logs actions with logging.info().",
  "flows": "Source: directory listing and file attribute reading -> Sink: moving files and creating directories based on file attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Code lacks validation of folder_path input; potential for directory traversal or unintended file moves if folder_path is manipulated. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. No external network activity or suspicious modules used.",
  "analysis": "The script performs local filesystem operations to organize files. It uses standard library functions for directory and file management, with no external or network activity. No signs of malicious code like data exfiltration, backdoors, or external communications. The logic is straightforward and benign, focusing solely on local file organization. There are no anomalies indicating sabotage or malware. The only potential concern is lack of input validation which could lead to unintended file operations if misused, but this is a typical design for a file management script and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard file organization utility with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs expected filesystem operations without malicious side effects.",
