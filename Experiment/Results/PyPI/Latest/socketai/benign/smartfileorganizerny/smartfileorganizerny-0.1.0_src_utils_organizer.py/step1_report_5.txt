  "purpose": "The code organizes files in a specified folder by type, date, or both, based on user-selected method.",
  "sources": "Reads directory contents via os.listdir(), checks file metadata via os.path functions, and accesses file extensions and modification times.",
  "sinks": "Uses shutil.move() to move files; logs information via logging.info().",
  "flows": "Source: Directory listing and file metadata reading -> Sink: Moving files to categorized folders.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or misleading code, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution present. The code performs standard file organization tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script lists directory contents, filters out hidden files and files with excluded extensions, then moves files based on the selected method. The methods are straightforward: organize by type, date, or both. The code performs standard file system operations with proper logging. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No suspicious network activity or obfuscated code. The functions are clear and typical for file management scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard file organization utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It solely manipulates local files based on simple criteria without any malicious or covert operations.",
