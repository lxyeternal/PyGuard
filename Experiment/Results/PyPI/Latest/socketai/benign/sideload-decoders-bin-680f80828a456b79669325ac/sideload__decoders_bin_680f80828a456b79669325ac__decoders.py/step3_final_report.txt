{
  "purpose": "Provides content decoding for various compression algorithms used in HTTP content encoding, including optional support for brotli and zstandard.",
  "sources": "Reads encoded data from input bytes in decode methods of each decoder class.",
  "sinks": "Processes data internally; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the decode() method through decompression routines, with optional dependencies used if available.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Optional dependencies are handled safely with fallbacks.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard content decoders with proper error handling and optional support for third-party libraries. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. Optional dependencies are imported with fallbacks, and error handling is appropriate. The overall structure is straightforward, with no external network or file operations beyond decompression routines. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified given the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of HTTP content decoders, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scoring in the reports accurately reflects the benign nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
