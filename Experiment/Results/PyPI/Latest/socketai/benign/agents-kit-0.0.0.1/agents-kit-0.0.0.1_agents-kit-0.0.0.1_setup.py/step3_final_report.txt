  "purpose": "A minimal Python package setup script using setuptools, intended to define package metadata.",
  "sources": "Static strings in the setup() function for package name, version, author, author_email, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is static and does not process input or generate output.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields are unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or malicious code. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The empty author fields are likely placeholders, not indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
