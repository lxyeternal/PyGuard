  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'agents-kit' with basic metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data such as name, version, author, author_email, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input or could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the setup function only uses static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution is present. The metadata fields are mostly empty, which is unusual but not malicious. The script does not perform any network operations, data processing, or include any code that could be malicious. It appears to be a benign placeholder package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
