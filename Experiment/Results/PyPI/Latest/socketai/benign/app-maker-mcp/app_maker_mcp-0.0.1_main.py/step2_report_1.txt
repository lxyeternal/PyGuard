  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code manages web apps via filesystem operations, HTTP server, environment variable replacements, and subprocess calls.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or backdoors are evident.\n- The environment variable replacements in JavaScript files are typical for dev or dynamic configuration.\n- Subprocess calls for opening URLs and Chrome refresh are standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The server handles responses via polling, with timeout safeguards.\n- No suspicious network activity or code injections are present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Standard app management.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious behavior. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Similar app management functions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malware detected. Slightly higher risk due to subprocess calls but still benign.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** Web app management, serving, and control.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity. The code’s functions are standard.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Web app management and serving.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious behavior. The code is straightforward.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** Web app management.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1–0.2) are consistent with the code review.\n- The only potential concern is subprocess calls for opening URLs or refreshing Chrome, but these are standard and controlled.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious payloads or backdoors)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, primarily due to subprocess calls and environment variable replacements, which are typical in such tools)\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n**The code is a legitimate web app management tool with no malicious activity detected.**  \n**Risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, with a very low risk score (~0.1).**",
