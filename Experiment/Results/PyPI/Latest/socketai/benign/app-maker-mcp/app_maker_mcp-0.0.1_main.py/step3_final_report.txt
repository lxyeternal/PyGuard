  "purpose": "Management and serving of local web applications, including creation, deletion, modification, and response handling.",
  "sources": "Filesystem operations (app directories, environment variables in JS files), user inputs, environment variables, network socket binding.",
  "sinks": "HTTP responses, subprocess calls for opening URLs and refreshing Chrome, file writes, environment variable replacements in served JS files.",
  "flows": "Filesystem reads for app files and environment variables, subprocess calls for opening URLs, HTTP GET requests triggering environment variable replacements, response polling via /wait_for_response endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic environment variable substitution in JavaScript files, subprocess calls for opening URLs and Chrome refresh, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code manages web apps through filesystem operations, serves files via an HTTP server with environment variable replacements, and uses subprocesses for opening URLs and refreshing Chrome. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The environment variable replacements are standard for dynamic configuration. Subprocess calls are controlled and typical for such tools. The server handles responses with polling and timeout safeguards. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate web app management and serving tool with no malicious activity detected. It employs standard practices for environment variable substitution and subprocess calls, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The overall security risk is very low.",
