  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some form of data processing or utility function, but without additional context or comments, its precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include environment variables, file reads, or network data; however, no explicit data input sources are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are function calls, data output, or network transmissions; the code does not explicitly show any data leakage or untrusted data being sent or written.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flow is observable in the provided code snippet, as no input or output operations are explicitly shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or unusual behavior are detected; the code appears straightforward without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns. It does not perform network operations, file manipulations, or use dynamic execution. It appears to be benign, possibly a utility module or part of a larger project. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or privacy violations within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems safe, with no indications of malware or security threats.",
