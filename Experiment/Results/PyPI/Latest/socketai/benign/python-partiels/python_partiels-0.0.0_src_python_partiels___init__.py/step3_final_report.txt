{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python script with no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent. It is a straightforward data processing module with no external communication or security flaws.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, function parameters, or external files (if any are used). No network or user input sources are explicitly indicated.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be data output to files, network transmission, or environment modifications. No such sinks are evident or suspicious in the provided context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (if any) through processing functions to output sinks. No untrusted data flows or insecure handling are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs are detected. The code structure is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured Python script performing data processing without external communication, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The absence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior supports a malware score of 0. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects minimal inherent risk, acknowledging the general risk associated with executing code in unknown environments. Confidence is high (0.8) due to the clarity and simplicity of the code, though limited context prevents absolute certainty.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
