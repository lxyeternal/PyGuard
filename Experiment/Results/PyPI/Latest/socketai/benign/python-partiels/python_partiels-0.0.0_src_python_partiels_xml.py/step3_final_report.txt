  "purpose": "Utility for generating XML configurations from templates, setting environment variables, and executing an external audio processing command.",
  "sources": "Template files loaded from package resources, input parameters such as template name, audio file path, destination, and format.",
  "sinks": "External subprocess command execution with parameters that could be influenced by untrusted inputs, leading to potential command injection.",
  "flows": "Template name and audio file path flow into createXml, which writes a temporary XML file; these, along with other parameters, flow into subprocess.run for execution.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; code structure is straightforward. Potential security concern due to lack of input validation for subprocess parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code loads templates, creates XML files, sets environment variables, and runs an external command. No malware or obfuscation detected. The main risk stems from unvalidated inputs passed to subprocess, which could lead to command injection if inputs are maliciously crafted. No network activity or backdoors are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score approximately 0.2-0.3, reflecting potential but unconfirmed vulnerabilities. The code appears legitimate, but input validation should be added to mitigate risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and performs legitimate functions, with no evidence of malicious activity. The primary concern is the potential for command injection due to unvalidated inputs. Scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the security risk is low to moderate. Implementing input validation would further improve security.",
