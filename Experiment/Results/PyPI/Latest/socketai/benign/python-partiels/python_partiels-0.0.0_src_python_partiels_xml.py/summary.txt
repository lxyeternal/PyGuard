  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and performs legitimate functions, with no evidence of malicious activity. The primary concern is the potential for command injection due to unvalidated inputs. Scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the security risk is low to moderate. Implementing input validation would further improve security."
