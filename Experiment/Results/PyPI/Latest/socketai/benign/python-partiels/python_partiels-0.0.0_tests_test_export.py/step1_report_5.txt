  "purpose": "Unit test for the Partiels class to verify the export functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded file paths and class methods that set paths and export data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes files to specified directories and interacts with filesystem paths.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded strings through method calls to filesystem writes, but no untrusted input handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded absolute file paths could be considered a code smell but not malicious. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected. No external network activity, environment variable usage, or credential handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and performs a straightforward unit test, setting specific paths and calling an export method. It does not process untrusted input, nor does it perform network operations or contain any suspicious constructs. The hardcoded paths are typical for testing but do not indicate malicious intent. The structure is simple and clean, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign unit test with no signs of malicious behavior. It simply tests a class method with fixed input values. No security risks are detected in this fragment.",
