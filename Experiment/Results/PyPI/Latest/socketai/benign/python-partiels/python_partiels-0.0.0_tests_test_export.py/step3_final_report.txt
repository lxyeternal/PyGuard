  "purpose": "Unit test for the Partiels class, setting execution and plugin paths, and exporting a spectrogram.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded absolute paths in setExecPath, setVampPath, and export method parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file exfiltration, no credential handling.",
  "flows": "Input paths are set directly; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of absolute paths; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test script that initializes a Partiels object, sets paths with hardcoded absolute strings, and calls export. No network activity, credential handling, or obfuscation is present. The paths are typical for testing environments. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The malware score is 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to hardcoded paths, which are common in testing but not ideal for production. The code's structure and behavior are benign and consistent across multiple reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
