{
  "purpose": "The code processes text documents by capitalizing words within annotations, specifically excluding annotations labeled 'sentence'.",
  "sources": "Reads data from Document objects' 'text' and 'annotations' attributes.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the 'text' attribute of Document objects; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads 'text' and 'annotations' from Document; processes annotations; updates 'text' attribute; annotations are cleared.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. Use of sorting functions for annotation processing is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and custom schemas; processes document annotations by capitalizing words within the annotation span, excluding 'sentence' labels. It sorts annotations and reconstructs the text accordingly. No external network calls, no injection points, no suspicious dynamic execution, or obfuscated code are present. The code performs straightforward text manipulation, and the logic appears intended and safe. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign text processing component with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs standard annotation-based text capitalization without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
