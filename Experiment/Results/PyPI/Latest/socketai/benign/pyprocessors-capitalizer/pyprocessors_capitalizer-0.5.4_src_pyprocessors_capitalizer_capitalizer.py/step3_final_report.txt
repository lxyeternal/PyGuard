{
  "purpose": "A straightforward text processor that capitalizes words within annotations, excluding those labeled 'sentence'. It modifies document text and clears annotations after processing.",
  "sources": "Reads from Document.text and Document.annotations",
  "sinks": "Modifies Document.text in memory; no external data sinks or network activity",
  "flows": "Reads annotations and text, processes annotations, updates text, clears annotations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple, benign text manipulation: sorting annotations, capitalizing words, reconstructing text, and clearing annotations. No external calls, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The functions used are standard, and the logic is straightforward. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0-0.2) are consistent with this benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard text processing utility with no malicious or obfuscated components. The low security risk scores are appropriate. For maximum confidence, the risk score can be uniformly set to 0.0, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
