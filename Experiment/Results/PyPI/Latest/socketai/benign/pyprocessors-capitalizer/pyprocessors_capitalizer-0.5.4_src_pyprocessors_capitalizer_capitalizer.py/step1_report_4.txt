{
  "purpose": "The code defines a processor that capitalizes words within annotations in text documents, likely for text processing or NLP tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads from document.text and document.annotations; annotations contain text and positional data.",
  "sinks": "Modifies document.text in-place; no external output or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Reads annotations from documents, processes annotation text to capitalize words, updates document.text with the processed content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No use of dynamic execution or obfuscation. No suspicious network activity or malicious payloads identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and typing modules, along with pydantic and custom plugin classes. It defines a simple processor that sorts annotations and capitalizes words within specified spans. The process method operates solely on in-memory data structures; it does not perform external network calls, system modifications, or handle sensitive credentials. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident, and no anomalies such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard text processing implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only manipulates text and annotations internally without external interactions.",
