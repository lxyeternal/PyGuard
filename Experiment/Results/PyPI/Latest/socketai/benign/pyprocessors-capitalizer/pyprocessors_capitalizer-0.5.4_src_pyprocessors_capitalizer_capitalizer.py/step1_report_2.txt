{
  "purpose": "The code implements a text processing pipeline that capitalizes words in document annotations, likely for formatting or normalization.",
  "sources": "Reads document.text, document.annotations, and annotation attributes such as text, start, end, and labelName.",
  "sinks": "Modifies document.text and document.annotations; no external data sinks or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Reads document.text and annotations as sources; writes back modified text to document.text; annotations are set to None after processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code uses sorting functions and string manipulations in a straightforward manner.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for processing text annotations, primarily capitalizing words within specific annotation spans. It sorts annotations based on position, reconstructs the text, and clears annotations after processing. No data is sent externally, no commands, or external system interactions are present. The code appears to be a standard text formatting utility without malicious intent or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal text processing module with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data flows. The functions and logic are consistent with legitimate text manipulation purposes.",
