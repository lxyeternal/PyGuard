{
  "purpose": "The code defines a processor class for text capitalization, which modifies document text and annotations.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'documents', specifically 'document.text' and 'document.annotations'.",
  "sinks": "Modifies 'document.text' and 'document.annotations' in-place; no external data outputs or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'documents' are processed by sorting annotations, modifying text, and updating annotations to None, with no external data flows or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Uses standard libraries. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code processes text documents by capitalizing words within annotations, sorting annotations, and updating the document's text and annotations accordingly. It employs standard Python libraries and modules with clear, straightforward logic. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation. Functions like 'natural_order' are simple sorting helpers. The process appears legitimate for text processing purposes without any malicious side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign text processing module with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. No malicious intent is evident.",
