{
  "purpose": "The script updates version numbers in Jenkinsfile and dependency constraints in pyproject.toml based on command-line input, primarily for version management.",
  "sources": "Reads 'MAJOR_VERSION' and 'MINOR_VERSION' lines from Jenkinsfile; reads and modifies dependency strings in pyproject.toml.",
  "sinks": "Replaces version lines and dependency strings within local files; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Reads version lines from Jenkinsfile → updates version numbers → writes back; reads dependency string from pyproject.toml → updates dependency constraints → writes back.",
  "anomalies": "Potential uninitialized variables 'to_replace' and 'by_replace' if expected lines are missing, which could cause runtime errors; no input validation or error handling implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file read-modify-write operations for version bumping and dependency updates. It uses regex to locate version lines but does not verify their existence before replacement, risking runtime errors if lines are absent. No malicious code, network activity, obfuscation, or external code execution is present. The logic is simple and benign, aimed at automating version management tasks. The main issue is robustness, not security.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for version and dependency updates with minor bugs related to uninitialized variables that could cause runtime errors. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate, reflecting potential stability issues rather than security concerns. All reports' scores are consistent with this assessment.",
