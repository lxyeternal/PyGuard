{
  "purpose": "The script updates version numbers in a Jenkinsfile and dependencies in a pyproject.toml file based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from reading the Jenkinsfile and pyproject.toml files from the filesystem. The command line argument determines the version part to increment.",
  "sinks": "The script writes back to the Jenkinsfile and pyproject.toml files, replacing version strings. It does not send data over the network or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Reads version lines from Jenkinsfile, updates version numbers, and replaces corresponding dependency strings in pyproject.toml. Writes updated content back to both files.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses undefined variables 'to_replace' and 'by_replace' if the 'if' conditions are not met, leading to potential runtime errors. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code present. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs file reading and string manipulation to increment version numbers. It employs regex to find version lines and updates them accordingly. No user input besides command line args influences the logic. No network activity, external code execution, or obfuscation observed. The only concern is the potential for runtime errors due to uninitialized variables if the expected lines are missing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version updater for project files. It does not contain malware, suspicious network activity, or malicious behavior. The main risk is its failure mode if expected lines are absent, not malicious intent.",
