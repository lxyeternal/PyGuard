{
  "purpose": "Update version numbers in Jenkinsfile and dependencies in pyproject.toml based on command-line argument",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (sys.argv), reading files (Jenkinsfile and pyproject.toml), reading file contents",
  "sinks": "File writes to Jenkinsfile and pyproject.toml",
  "flows": "Command-line argument -> file reading -> pattern matching and replacement -> file writing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code. Use of regex and string replacement is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a command-line argument to determine whether to increment major or minor version. It reads 'Jenkinsfile' and searches for version variables using regex, then updates these variables accordingly. It also updates dependency version constraints in 'pyproject.toml'. All operations are file manipulations and string replacements without external data influence or malicious activity. No network communication, no credential handling, no obfuscated or suspicious code. The code is simple and intended for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs version bumping tasks in configuration files without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not exhibit malware behavior, nor does it handle sensitive data in a malicious way. Overall, it is a benign utility script.",
