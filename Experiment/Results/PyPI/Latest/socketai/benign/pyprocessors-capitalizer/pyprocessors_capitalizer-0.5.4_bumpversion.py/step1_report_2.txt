{
  "purpose": "Update version numbers in Jenkinsfile and dependency constraints in pyproject.toml based on input argument",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line arguments, reads files './Jenkinsfile' and './pyproject.toml'",
  "sinks": "Writes back modified data to the same files, potential for data corruption if input files are maliciously crafted",
  "flows": "Command-line argument -> File reading (Jenkinsfile, pyproject.toml) -> String processing -> File writing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no external network connections, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The script reads version info from a Jenkinsfile, modifies the major or minor version based on input, and updates dependency version constraints in pyproject.toml. The code uses regular expressions to find version lines and replace them. No user input from untrusted sources other than command-line arguments affects external systems; the script only modifies local files. There is no suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a version management purpose. The use of string replacement is simple and does not involve executing untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs file modifications related to versioning without any malicious intent or suspicious activity. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond potential file corruption if misused, which is typical for such scripts. Overall, the script is benign.",
