{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script is used to configure and install a Python package called 'pyprocessors-capitalizer' with specified dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package lists, dependencies, metadata, and entry point configurations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the script does not perform data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "The script flows from defining static configuration variables to passing them into the setup() function, which manages package installation.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual patterns. The code is a typical setup script generated by a build tool.",
  "analysis": "The script imports distutils.core.setup, defines package metadata, dependencies, extras, entry points, and calls setup() with these parameters. All data are static or predefined. There is no user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The structure and content are typical for a setup.py file. No suspicious or malicious code behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package setup script.",
