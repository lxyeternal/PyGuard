  "purpose": "Standard setup.py configuration generated by Flit for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependencies, and entry point definitions; no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data fetching present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup.py script with no dynamic execution, user input, or network activity. All dependencies and metadata are hardcoded and standard for Python packaging. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate a benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals point to a safe supply chain component.",
