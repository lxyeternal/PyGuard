  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the Python project 'pyprocessors-capitalizer'.",
  "sources": "Reading package definitions, dependencies, entry points, and metadata from static variables and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script mainly defines static configuration data for packaging.",
  "flows": "N/A — static configuration with no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging Python modules. It uses static data to define packages, dependencies, entry points, and metadata. No input handling or runtime data processing is present. The dependencies are typical for development and documentation purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are evident. The code does not perform any network communication, system modification, or sensitive data access.\n\nGiven the straightforward structure and absence of dynamic or untrusted data handling, the script appears to be a legitimate, benign setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
