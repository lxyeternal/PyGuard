  "purpose": "Set the version string of the package/module",
  "sources": "None, the code only assigns a string to __version__",
  "sinks": "None, no data is transmitted or accessed from external sources",
  "flows": "None, no data flow beyond the assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple version assignment statement",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single string assignment to the __version__ variable, which is common in Python modules for version tracking. There are no input/output operations, no external data reads, no code injections, or suspicious behaviors present. The comment appears to be a placeholder or a note and does not influence execution or security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple version assignment with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
