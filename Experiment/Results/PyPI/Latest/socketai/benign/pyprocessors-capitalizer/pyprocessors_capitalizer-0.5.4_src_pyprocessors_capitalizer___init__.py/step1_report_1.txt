  "flows": "None (no data flow from sources to sinks)",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a docstring with a suspicious instruction ('Replace document text with capitalized annotations'), which is unusual and potentially malicious or deceptive",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a version string assignment and a docstring that appears to be a comment or instruction. The instruction inside the docstring is suspicious because it references manipulating document text, which could be related to malicious activity if executed in a context where it alters document contents. However, since the code does not perform any action beyond defining a version, there is no active malicious behavior or data flow. The unusual docstring warrants caution, but no active malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and primarily serves as a version declaration. The suspicious docstring does not perform any operation but indicates potential intent to modify document text, which could be malicious if used improperly. Overall, no malicious behavior is detected, but the instruction within the docstring is notable and should be reviewed in the broader context.",
