  "purpose": "Define package version with a benign comment.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only a static version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows present.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; only a static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious instruction in the docstring: \"Replace document text with capitalized annotations,\" which suggests document manipulation but is not executed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a version string assignment and a docstring comment. The comment is potentially misleading but not active code; no malicious behavior, data processing, or external interactions are present. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the minimal code and the suspicious comment, which does not translate into actual malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no active malicious or obfuscated elements. The only concern is the misleading comment, which does not impact security. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.",
