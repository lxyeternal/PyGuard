  "purpose": "The code loads a JSON document, processes it with a capitalizer, and saves the modified document back to a JSON file.",
  "sources": "Reading the JSON file 'x_cago_ner_de-document-test.json' from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Writing the processed JSON data to 'x_cago_ner_de-document-new.json' on the filesystem.",
  "flows": "Reads JSON input from disk -> loads into Python object -> processes text via CapitalizerProcessor -> serializes processed data back to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a test function. It reads a JSON file containing document data, processes the text field with an imported CapitalizerProcessor, then writes the processed document back to a new JSON file. The code uses standard library functions and clearly defined third-party modules. No malicious or suspicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection, is observed. The processing appears benign, focused on text transformation. The file read/write operations are standard and do not involve untrusted data from external sources beyond the initial JSON file. No anomalies or malware signals are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test script that loads, processes, and saves document data with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured with no suspicious elements.",
