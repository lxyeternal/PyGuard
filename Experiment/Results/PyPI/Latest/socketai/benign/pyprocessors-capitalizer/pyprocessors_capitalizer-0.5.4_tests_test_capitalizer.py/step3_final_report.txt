  "purpose": "A simple test routine that loads a JSON document, processes it with a text capitalizer, and saves the output.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON file 'x_cago_ner_de-document-test.json' from disk.",
  "sinks": "Writing processed JSON to 'x_cago_ner_de-document-new.json' on disk.",
  "flows": "Load JSON -> process with CapitalizerProcessor -> save JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file I/O and data processing with well-known libraries and modules. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The code is a simple test function with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The code's operations are standard and do not pose security risks. The high confidence scores (0.9-1) are justified. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed or inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are accurate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
