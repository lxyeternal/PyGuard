  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration file.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies are identified.\n- The only imported module besides standard libraries is `pyprocessors_capitalizer`, used solely to access its `__version__` attribute.\n- No external data sources, network activity, user input, or data sinks are present.\n- The code is static, with no dynamic or executable content that could pose security risks.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or security issues.\n\n**Critical observations:**\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying that this is a benign configuration script.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the analysis is based on code inspection.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified given the content.\n\n**Final expert judgment:**\n\n- The code is a typical, well-structured Sphinx configuration file.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
