  "purpose": "Configuration for the Sphinx documentation builder, setting up extensions, paths, and project info.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'os' and 'pyprocessors_capitalizer'; references to module attributes such as '__version__'; configuration variables and lists.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that process untrusted data; no code execution, network access, or data output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable; the code primarily sets configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious imports are present. All imports and variables appear standard for a documentation setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file that imports a local package 'pyprocessors_capitalizer' to get version info and sets various documentation build options. It uses well-known extensions and path configurations typical for Sphinx. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing functions are present. The imports are static, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The code adheres to common documentation setup practices, with no suspicious or malicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended solely for documentation build configuration.",
