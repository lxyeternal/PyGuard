  "purpose": "This code serves as a configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder, setting project info, extensions, and output options.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'pyprocessors_capitalizer' module for version info, and standard modules like 'os'. No external data or user input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "Static configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script importing only necessary modules for setup. It does not perform any dynamic actions, network communication, or data processing. The import of 'pyprocessors_capitalizer' is benign, used solely for version info. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's structure and content are consistent with a typical documentation setup, and no anomalies or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports' assessments are accurate and justified. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
