  "purpose": "Configuration for Sphinx documentation builder for the 'pyprocessors_capitalizer' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'os' and 'pyprocessors_capitalizer', and configuration parameters for Sphinx extensions and options.",
  "sinks": "None identifiable; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows related to untrusted inputs or sensitive data are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with comments and setup for generating documentation. It imports only standard modules and a local package for version info. Extensions are specified for documentation features, and paths are configured accordingly. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or external data handling is evident. The code appears to follow best practices for a documentation configuration file, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Sphinx configuration script with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies identified. It functions solely to configure documentation generation for the package.",
