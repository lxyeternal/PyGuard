  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder with imported modules and extensions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for os and pyprocessors_capitalizer; references to version attribute of pyprocessors_capitalizer; extension configurations and paths.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly uses untrusted data sources or writes data to external systems; no network connections or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration settings are static and predetermined.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code mainly defines static configuration parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports standard and third-party Sphinx extensions, sets project metadata, configures documentation options, and specifies static paths. No dynamic code execution, user input processing, or external data handling occurs. The imported module 'pyprocessors_capitalizer' is used solely for obtaining version info, which appears benign. No embedded or obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It mainly sets up documentation parameters with no suspicious activity.",
