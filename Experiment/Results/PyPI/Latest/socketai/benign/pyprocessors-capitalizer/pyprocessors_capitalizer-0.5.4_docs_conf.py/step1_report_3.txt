  "purpose": "Configuration for Sphinx documentation builder for the 'pyprocessors_capitalizer' project.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pyprocessors_capitalizer' module to access version info; reading environment variables 'os' and 'sys' (though not used); static path and pattern configurations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks, network operations, or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily sets configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present. All imports and configurations are standard for a Sphinx setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' and a project-specific module 'pyprocessors_capitalizer' to retrieve version information. It defines standard Sphinx configuration options, including extensions, templates, static paths, and HTML theme settings. The 'extensions' list includes legitimate Sphinx and third-party extensions for documentation generation, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. There are no environment variables, network calls, or data handling that could pose security risks. The code appears to be a typical configuration file for documentation generation, with all parts consistent with intended use.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Sphinx configuration file for project documentation. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. The code's purpose is solely to configure documentation generation, and it does so in a typical, safe manner.",
