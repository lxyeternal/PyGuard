  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration file.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies are identified.\n- The only imported module beyond standard libraries is `pyprocessors_capitalizer`, used solely to retrieve version info.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step evaluation:\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious Code:**\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments.\n- The import of `pyprocessors_capitalizer` appears benign, used only for version info.\n\n**2. Code Flaws or Logical Errors:**\n- No logical flaws or errors are apparent.\n- The code follows typical Sphinx configuration patterns.\n\n**3. Scores Justification:**\n- Malware: 0 in all reports, justified by the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated: 0, justified as no obfuscation detected.\n- Risk: 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n**4. Any Assumptions or Claims:**\n- All claims are based on static code analysis, with no runtime or external data considerations.\n- The reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n**5. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No need for adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the detailed reviews, the code is a **benign, standard configuration file** for Sphinx documentation. There are **no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks**.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose without any security concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed.",
