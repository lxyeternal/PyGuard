  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: `from .sbmp import *`.\n- The main concern revolves around the use of relative import and wildcard import.\n- No actual malicious code is visible; the risk hinges on the content of the 'sbmp' module.\n- The reports assign very low malware scores (mostly 0), which aligns with the fact that the import statement alone isn't malicious.\n- Security risk scores are also low, reflecting the limited scope of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues in the code:\n- The code is a simple relative import with a wildcard, which is standard syntax but generally discouraged due to namespace pollution.\n- No direct evidence of malicious behavior or code execution is present solely from this snippet.\n- The actual security implications depend on the content of the 'sbmp' module, which isn't provided.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Use of 'import *'**: While the reports mention that 'import *' can be problematic, they correctly note that it is not inherently malicious.\n- **Relative import**: The reports correctly identify that relative imports are common in packages but can sometimes be suspicious if the package structure is compromised.\n- **Lack of context**: All reports acknowledge that without inspecting 'sbmp', no definitive conclusion about maliciousness can be made.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is reasonable given the information.\n- Security risk scores are mostly 0.2 or 0.3, reflecting minor concerns about namespace pollution but not security threats.\n- The confidence levels vary but are generally appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5, which is appropriate. The code itself isn't malicious, but the import of an unknown module can be risky if the module is malicious.\n- Since the actual content of 'sbmp' isn't provided, a high risk score isn't justified.\n\n### Malware scores:\n- All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n### Assumptions and claims:\n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about the content of 'sbmp'.\n- They correctly state that the security risk depends on the imported module's content.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate, given the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to potential namespace pollution, but minimal security concern)\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard import statement with no direct malicious activity. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the 'sbmp' module, which cannot be assessed here. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The security posture would improve if the content of 'sbmp' were reviewed, but based solely on this import statement, there's no evidence of malicious intent.",
