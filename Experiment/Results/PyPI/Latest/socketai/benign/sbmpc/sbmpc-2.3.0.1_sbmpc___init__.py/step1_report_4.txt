{
  "purpose": "The code imports everything from the module '.sbmp', likely to utilize its functions or classes.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the module '.sbmp' from the current package or directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks in this snippet since it only performs an import; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to the import statement; if '.sbmp' contains malicious code, it could execute upon import.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a relative import (from .sbmp import *) is unusual in standalone scripts and can sometimes hide malicious modules if the package structure is compromised. The code lacks context or validation.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal import statement that pulls in all contents from the '.sbmp' module. The actual behavior depends entirely on what '.sbmp' contains. If '.sbmp' is malicious, importing it could execute malicious code. No further code or context is provided, making assessment limited. The import alone is not inherently malicious but warrants inspection of the '.sbmp' module for any malicious or suspicious content.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a simple import statement that depends entirely on the contents of the '.sbmp' module. Without analyzing '.sbmp' itself, it is impossible to determine malicious intent. The snippet itself is not suspicious but should prompt review of the imported module.",
