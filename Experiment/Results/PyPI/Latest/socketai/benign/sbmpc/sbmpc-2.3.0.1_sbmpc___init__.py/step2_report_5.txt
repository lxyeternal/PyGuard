  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .sbmp import *\n```\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that this is a relative import from a module named `sbmp`.\n- The use of `import *` is generally discouraged because it pollutes the namespace and makes it harder to track what is imported, but it is not inherently malicious.\n- The actual security risk or maliciousness depends entirely on the contents of the `sbmp` module, which is not provided here.\n- The import statement itself is simple and does not perform any data processing, network activity, or code execution beyond executing the module code upon import.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports focus on the import statement, which is correct. There are no anomalies or malicious behaviors directly observable in this line alone.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports generally avoid over-speculation; they correctly state that the security implications depend on the content of `sbmp`.\n- Some reports mention that `import *` can be problematic, which is a valid point but not a security issue per se.\n- No report claims the import is malicious, which aligns with the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Score Review and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate because the import statement alone does not indicate malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`, which is correct; there's no obfuscation visible.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly `0.2` or `0.3`, reflecting a mild concern about importing untrusted modules, which is reasonable.  \n  - Since the actual content of `sbmp` is unknown, a low risk score is appropriate.  \n  - The last report assigns `0`, which is also reasonable given the limited information.\n\n### Should any scores be adjusted?\n- Given the information, the scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Potential for malicious content:** If `sbmp` contains malicious code, importing it could execute that code, which might be dangerous. However, without inspecting `sbmp`, we cannot confirm this.\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5:** None of the reports assign such scores, which is correct. The import alone does not justify a high risk unless the module is known to be malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a simple relative import from `sbmp`.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are all appropriately low or zero.\n- The reports correctly emphasize that the actual risk depends on the contents of `sbmp`.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, acknowledging that importing untrusted code can be risky, but no evidence here)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet itself is benign. The security concern hinges entirely on the trustworthiness of the `sbmp` module, which cannot be assessed from this import statement alone. The current scoring and analysis are appropriate and consistent.",
