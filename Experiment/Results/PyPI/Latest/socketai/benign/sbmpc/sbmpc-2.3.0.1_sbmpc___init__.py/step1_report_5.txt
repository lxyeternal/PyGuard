  "purpose": "Import all contents from the sbmp module within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement indicating the use of the sbmp module within the package",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks present in this single import statement",
  "flows": "No data flow observable from the provided code fragment",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import syntax which can sometimes obscure dependencies, but no malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import of the sbmp module, which is common in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. No input reading or data exfiltration points are present. As this is just an import statement, it does not pose any security risk on its own. No obfuscation or malicious code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply includes another module from the same package, and there are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies detected.",
