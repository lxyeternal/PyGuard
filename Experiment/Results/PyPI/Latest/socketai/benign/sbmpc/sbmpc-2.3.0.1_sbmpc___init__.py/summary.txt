  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and standard in Python packages. No evidence of malicious intent or behavior is present in this snippet. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of the 'sbmp' module, which cannot be assessed here. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score of 0.2 are appropriate, reflecting that the risk depends on external module content, not the import statement itself."
