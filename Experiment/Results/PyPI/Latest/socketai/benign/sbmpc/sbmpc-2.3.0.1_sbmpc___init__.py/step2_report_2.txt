  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .sbmp import *\n```\n\n**Overall assessment of the code snippet:**\n- It's a relative import of all contents from the `sbmp` module.\n- No direct malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are visible in this line alone.\n- The security implications depend heavily on the contents of the `sbmp` module itself.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the import and potential risk if `sbmp` contains malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.6\n- **Comments:** The risk score is low but acknowledges the possibility if `sbmp` is malicious. The malware score is zero, which aligns with the code alone not executing malicious behavior unless the module itself is malicious.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Highlights the use of `import *` and notes that it can be problematic but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.7\n- **Comments:** Correctly notes that `import *` can cause namespace pollution but isn't inherently malicious.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to above, emphasizes that the pattern isn't malicious but can be problematic.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.3\n- **Comments:** Correctly assesses that without the content of `sbmp`, no malicious activity can be inferred.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Recognizes that importing potentially malicious code depends on the contents of `.sbmp`.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.4\n- **Comments:** Valid assessment; the import could execute malicious code if the module is malicious.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to previous, notes that the import is straightforward and not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Confidence: 1\n- **Comments:** The confidence is high, but the code itself is benign; the risk is entirely in the module's content.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code alone doesn't exhibit malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low (0.2), which is reasonable given the minimal code and potential risk depending on `sbmp`.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports correctly identify that the actual risk depends on the content of `sbmp`.\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged but not malicious.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent in the import statement itself.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected in the import statement itself)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, based on the potential risk if `sbmp` is malicious)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and appropriately cautious. The actual security risk hinges on the content of the `sbmp` module, which isn't provided. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese are consistent with the analysis that the import statement itself is benign but warrants review of the `sbmp` module for potential malicious content.",
