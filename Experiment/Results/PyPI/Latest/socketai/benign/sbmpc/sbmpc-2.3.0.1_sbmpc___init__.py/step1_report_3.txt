  "purpose": "Import all components from the sbmp module",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from .sbmp (relative module)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this single import statement",
  "flows": "No data flow; import statement only",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (from .sbmp import *) which can obscure source of imported entities, but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement that imports all contents from a relative module named sbmp. This pattern can sometimes be problematic if the module contains malicious or unwanted code, but the statement itself is not malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code in this snippet. Without additional context or content from the sbmp module, it's not possible to identify malicious behavior or security risks directly from this line.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no immediate malicious indicators. The use of wildcard import is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution, but it does not imply malicious intent. Insufficient information to determine malicious activity or security risks solely from this line.",
