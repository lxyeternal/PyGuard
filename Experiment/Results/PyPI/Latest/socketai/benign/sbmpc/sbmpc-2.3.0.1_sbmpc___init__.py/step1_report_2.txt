{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the 'sbmp' module, likely part of a package's internal structure.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .sbmp import *' (importing from a local module)",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this line.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be established from this single import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered unusual or potentially problematic, as it may hide imported contents and lead to namespace pollution; however, it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a relative import from a module named 'sbmp' within the same package. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged because it obscures which symbols are imported and can lead to maintenance issues, but it does not indicate malicious intent by itself. There are no visible data sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors present in this single import statement. Without additional context or code, no malicious activity or security risks can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evident malicious behavior. The use of 'import *' is a potential code quality concern but not a security threat. No malware or malicious intent is detected based solely on this line.",
