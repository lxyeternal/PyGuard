  "purpose": "Import all contents from the 'sbmp' module within the current package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input sources are evident in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of code within 'sbmp' upon import; no direct data leaks or external effects are visible here.",
  "flows": "The import triggers execution of 'sbmp' code during module loading; no further source-to-sink flow is observable in this line.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import and 'import *'—common in packages but discouraged for namespace clarity; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of all symbols from 'sbmp'. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues are evident solely from this line. The security implications depend entirely on the content of 'sbmp', which is unknown. The import does not execute malicious behavior by itself but could run malicious code if present in 'sbmp'. The use of 'import *' is a code quality concern but not a security risk. The import statement itself is benign; risks are associated with the module's content, not the import syntax.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and standard in Python packages. No evidence of malicious intent or behavior is present in this snippet. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of the 'sbmp' module, which cannot be assessed here. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score of 0.2 are appropriate, reflecting that the risk depends on external module content, not the import statement itself.",
