{
  "purpose": "The code imports everything from a module named 'sbmp'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'sbmp' module, which could contain code or data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if 'sbmp' contains malicious code, executing the import could trigger malicious behavior or code execution.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads and executes the contents of 'sbmp', which could include various functions or code paths.",
  "anomalies": "The import uses a relative import syntax, but this is standard in Python packages; no unusual or suspicious patterns are evident. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import, which is a common Python pattern for package modules. There is no visible malicious behavior in this line alone, but importing unknown modules can be risky if the module contains malicious code. Since only the import statement is shown, the actual content and behavior depend on 'sbmp'. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected within this line, and it does not involve any suspicious data flow or security risks beyond the inherent risk of importing an untrusted module.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard relative import from the 'sbmp' module. There is no direct evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet, but the security depends on the trustworthiness of the 'sbmp' module itself.",
