  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple relative import: `from .sbmp import *`.\n- None of the reports provide evidence of malicious code within the import statement itself.\n- The key concern is the trustworthiness of the 'sbmp' module, which cannot be assessed solely from the import statement.\n- Use of `import *` is generally discouraged for code clarity and maintainability but is not inherently malicious.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected in the snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The import statements are syntactically correct and typical in Python packages.\n- **Malicious code:** Cannot be confirmed based solely on the import line; it depends on the content of 'sbmp'.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors are evident; the only concern is potential trustworthiness.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the lack of evidence for malicious behavior.\n- **Justification:** Importing a module does not inherently execute malicious code unless the module itself contains malicious payloads. Since no such payloads are demonstrated, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the straightforward import statements.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- Most reports assign a low score (0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in the import statement itself.\n- **Justification:** Importing an untrusted module can be risky if the module contains malicious code. However, the import alone does not execute code beyond the initial load. The risk depends on the module's content, which is unknown here.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Potential overestimation of risk:** Given only the import statement, assigning a security risk of 0.2 seems cautious but reasonable.\n- **Potential underestimation:** If 'sbmp' is from an untrusted source, the risk could be higher. However, without evidence, maintaining a low score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The reports correctly identify that the actual risk depends on the 'sbmp' module's content.\n- No report suggests malicious intent or behavior based solely on the import line.\n- The use of `import *` should be flagged as a code quality concern but not a security concern unless it hides malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to the potential risk of importing untrusted code, but no direct evidence)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe import statement itself appears benign. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the 'sbmp' module, which cannot be determined from the snippet alone. The current scores are reasonable, but the overall security posture should include validation of the 'sbmp' module before use.\n\n**Note:** If additional content from 'sbmp' were available, a more detailed analysis could be performed.",
