      "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and standard in Python packages. No evidence of malicious intent or behavior is present in this snippet. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of the 'sbmp' module, which cannot be assessed here. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score of 0.2 are appropriate, reflecting that the risk depends on external module content, not the import statement itself."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code collection is primarily benign, serving as a static repository of programming snippets. However, the inclusion of malicious code snippets like the keylogger elevates the potential security risk. The scripts do not actively perform malicious actions but could be misused if snippets are executed. Adjusting the malware score to approximately 0.4 and maintaining a moderate risk score around 0.45 provides a balanced assessment of the potential threat."
