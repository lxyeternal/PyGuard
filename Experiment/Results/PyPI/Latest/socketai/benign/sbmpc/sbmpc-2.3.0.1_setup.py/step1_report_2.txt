  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'sbmpc' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.txt' and 'CHANGELOG.txt' files for long description, and package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network or system calls, no environment variables, no code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading files for long_description during setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without error handling; URL is empty (potential placeholder), but no malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It reads description files to build package metadata and calls setup() with provided parameters. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior observed. The open() calls could raise exceptions if files are missing but are common in setup scripts. The empty URL is likely a placeholder and not suspicious. No obfuscated or malicious code is present. Overall, the script appears to be legitimate package setup code with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical package configuration file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks based on the provided content.",
