  "conclusion": "The code collection is primarily benign, serving as a static repository of programming snippets. However, the inclusion of malicious code snippets like the keylogger elevates the potential security risk. The scripts do not actively perform malicious actions but could be misused if snippets are executed. Adjusting the malware score to approximately 0.4 and maintaining a moderate risk score around 0.45 provides a balanced assessment of the potential threat."
