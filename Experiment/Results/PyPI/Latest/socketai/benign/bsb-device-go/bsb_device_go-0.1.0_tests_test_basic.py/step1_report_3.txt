  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a comment and no executable statements, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains only a comment line with no actual code execution, data handling, or function calls. This minimal state offers no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The absence of code makes it impossible for any malicious activity to occur within this snippet. Therefore, the code is essentially inert and poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is non-functional and contains only a comment. No malicious behavior or security risks are present in this snippet.",
