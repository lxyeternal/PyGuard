  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe code that is essentially empty or only contains comments and separators.\n- No sources, sinks, data flows, or executable logic are present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is appropriate given the trivial nature of the code.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is consistent since there is no code to obfuscate.\n- Security risk scores are 0 across all reports, which is justified given the lack of any operational code or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in any of the code snippets. They are just comments or separators.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** No logical flaws are apparent; the assessments correctly identify the code as benign and non-functional.\n- **Score appropriateness:**\n  - Malware scores are correctly set to 0.\n  - Security risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n  - Obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.\n  - Confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n\n### Potential improvements:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable; no changes are necessary.\n- The only minor note: since the code is just a separator/comment, the confidence could be slightly higher (e.g., 1), but 0.9 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Rationale:** The code snippets are empty or only contain comments, which are inherently benign. There is no evidence or suspicion of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scoring. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
