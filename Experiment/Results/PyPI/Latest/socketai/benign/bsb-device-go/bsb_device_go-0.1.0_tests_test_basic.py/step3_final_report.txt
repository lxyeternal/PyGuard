  "purpose": "The code is an inert placeholder containing only comments or separators with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only comments or separator lines present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code is non-functional.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious patterns; only comments and separators.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the snippets as empty or comment-only, with no executable logic or malicious behavior. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0. Confidence levels are high due to the trivial nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the assessments are consistent across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign placeholders with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are accurate and justified. No further modifications or actions are necessary.",
