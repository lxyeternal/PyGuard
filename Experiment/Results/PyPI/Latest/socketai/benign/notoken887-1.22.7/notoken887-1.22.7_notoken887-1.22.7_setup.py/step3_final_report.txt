  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'notoken887' Python library with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package metadata (name, version, author, email, url, description).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') as hardcoded strings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script with static parameters. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The only anomalies are unprofessional contact info and URL, which do not constitute security vulnerabilities or malware. The malware score is correctly 0, as there is no malicious code. The obfuscated score is 0, given the straightforward static code. The security risk score, based on the metadata, is slightly elevated (around 0.2-0.3) but does not reflect active threats. Considering the metadata alone, a marginal increase to approximately 0.4 could be justified, but overall, the code remains benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with suspicious contact info and URL that do not indicate malicious intent. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. The security risk score should be maintained around 0.2-0.3, with a slight consideration for metadata concerns. Overall, the package poses no security threat, and the primary concern is reputation management rather than technical security.",
