  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging the 'notoken887' Python library.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call (name, version, author info, description, URL, classifiers, python_requires).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input, data leak points, or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "N/A - All data is static and predefined; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; all code consists of a standard setup() call with static arguments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to define package metadata. No dynamic code, input reading, or external data processing occurs. All fields are hardcoded, and there are no suspicious or malicious operations. The inclusion of the URL 'https://thugging.org' is unusual and may be intended as a joke or a malicious redirect, but from a code execution perspective, it does not pose a security risk. No obfuscation, malicious code, or external data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward package setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable aspect is the URL which appears unusual but does not impact code security.",
