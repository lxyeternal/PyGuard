  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters (name, version, packages, author, email, description, url, classifiers, python_requires).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, no data leaks, no external untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; all parameters are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obviously inappropriate email address ('hitler@gmail.com'), suspicious URL ('https://thugging.org'), and unprofessional author info. No code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setuptools setup configuration with hardcoded package info. There are no dynamic inputs, no network connections, and no suspicious code constructs. The choice of email and URL raises concerns about the trustworthiness or intent of the package creator but does not constitute malicious code. The description suggests it is a simple test library with obfuscation as part of its purpose. No malware or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup configuration file with questionable author details but no malicious code or security risks detected. The code appears to be straightforward and used for packaging a Python library without malicious intent.",
