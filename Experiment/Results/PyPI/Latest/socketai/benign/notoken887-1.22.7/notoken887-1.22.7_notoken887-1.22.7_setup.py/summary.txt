  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with suspicious contact info and URL that do not indicate malicious intent. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. The security risk score should be maintained around 0.2-0.3, with a slight consideration for metadata concerns. Overall, the package poses no security threat, and the primary concern is reputation management rather than technical security."
