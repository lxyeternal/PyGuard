  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the original code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Original Code Summary:**\n- Class: `TokenCryptor`\n- Methods: `encrypt` replaces `'M'` with `'∩'` (Unicode U+2229), `decrypt` reverses.\n- Behavior: Simple character substitution, no external dependencies, no malicious code.\n- Security: Very insecure as a cryptographic method, but benign.\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: Very low (~0.1)\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a trivial substitution cipher, benign, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors:** None. The description aligns with the code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, SecurityRisk 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; recognizes the simple substitution, benign, no malicious intent.\n- **Errors:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, SecurityRisk 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same pattern; straightforward, non-malicious string replacement.\n- **Errors:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, SecurityRisk 0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as others; simple, insecure substitution cipher, benign.\n- **Errors:** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, SecurityRisk 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same assessment; trivial character replacement, no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, SecurityRisk 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is trivial, benign, and non-malicious.\n- Malware score is consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk is very low (~0.1), aligning with the code's simplicity.\n- Obfuscation is 0, as the code is straightforward.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation techniques used.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — negligible, given the code's trivial nature.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The code does not perform any external operations, network activity, or contain hidden behavior.\n- The character substitution is extremely simple and easily reversible.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are warranted here.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Value | Justification                                                      |\n|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious behavior, code is benign and straightforward.        |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | No obfuscation techniques present; code is clear and simple.       |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1          | Very minimal risk; trivial substitution cipher, no security concern. |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the reports' conclusions and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code.",
