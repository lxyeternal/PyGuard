{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character replacement encryption and decryption methods for strings, specifically replacing 'M' with '∩' and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "Returns of the encrypt and decrypt methods; no external data sinks or outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace('M', '∩') -> output; Input encrypted token -> replace('∩', 'M') -> output.",
  "anomalies": "The encryption is extremely simplistic and does not provide any security; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods performing character replacement for encryption and decryption. The methods operate solely on string inputs and outputs without side effects, external data handling, or complex logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The encryption mechanism is trivial and not intended for security purposes. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a basic, insecure character substitution cipher without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not exhibit malware or malicious behavior; its security risk score is negligible.",
