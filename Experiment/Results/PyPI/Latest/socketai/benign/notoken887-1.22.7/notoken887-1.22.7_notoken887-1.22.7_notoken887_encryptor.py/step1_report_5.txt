{
  "purpose": "A simple class for encrypting and decrypting tokens by replacing characters",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'string' in encrypt method and 'encrypted_token' in decrypt method",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output transformed strings",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace 'M' with '∩' -> output; Encrypted token -> replace '∩' with 'M' -> output",
  "anomalies": "The encryption is very simplistic, merely character replacement; no cryptographic security, no external data handling, no obfuscation or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The class provides straightforward string replacement methods for 'encryption' and 'decryption' by swapping a specific character with a symbol. There are no external data inputs other than the method parameters. No suspicious or malicious code, no data leakage, no external network activity, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors present. The methods are deterministic and trivial, indicating no malicious intent or malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to be a basic character substitution utility with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple character substitution class with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful or suspicious actions. The encryption method is very weak and not suitable for security purposes, but it does not introduce malware or security vulnerabilities.",
