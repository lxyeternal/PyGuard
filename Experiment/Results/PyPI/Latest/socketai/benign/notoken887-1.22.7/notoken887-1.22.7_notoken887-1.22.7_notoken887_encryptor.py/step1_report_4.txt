  "purpose": "A simple class providing basic string substitution encryption and decryption methods.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "Returned strings from encrypt and decrypt methods; no external data sinks are used.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace('M', '∩') -> output encrypted string; encrypted string -> replace('∩', 'M') -> output decrypted string.",
  "anomalies": "The encryption method is a very basic and insecure substitution that can easily be reversed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The class offers simplistic string replacement functions for 'encryption' and 'decryption'. These are not secure cryptographic functions and do not pose malware or security risks. The methods operate only on strings provided at runtime, with no external data access or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a trivial and insecure substitution cipher without malicious intent. It does not exhibit malware characteristics or security threats, but its use as an encryption method is ineffective. Overall, it is benign with no security risks.",
