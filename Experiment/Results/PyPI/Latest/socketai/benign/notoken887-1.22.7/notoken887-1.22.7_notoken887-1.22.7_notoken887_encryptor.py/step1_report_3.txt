{
  "purpose": "Simple obfuscation of strings by replacing specific characters, likely for data encoding or obscuration.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'string' in encrypt method; input parameter 'encrypted_token' in decrypt method.",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting the transformed strings; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow through replace operations, returning obfuscated or deobfuscated strings.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the class performs basic string replacement without any additional security or validation features. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The class 'TokenCryptor' provides simple character replacement methods for 'M' and '∩'. The encrypt method replaces 'M' with '∩', and decrypt replaces '∩' back to 'M'. The code is straightforward, with no external data sources, no use of network, files, or environment variables. There are no indications of malicious activity or sabotage, just basic string manipulation. No obfuscated code, no suspicious logic or behavior detected. The operations are safe and benign, intended for simple obfuscation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs minimal, non-security-related string replacement. There is no malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security risks present. It appears to be a trivial obfuscation utility.",
