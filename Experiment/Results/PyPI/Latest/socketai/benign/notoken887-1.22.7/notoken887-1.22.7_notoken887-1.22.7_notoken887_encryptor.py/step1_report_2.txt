{
  "purpose": "A simple substitution cipher class for replacing specific characters in strings, presumably for encoding and decoding tokens.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods.",
  "sinks": "Output of 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods; no other data sinks or external data sources are present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace 'M' with '∩' in 'encrypt' -> output; Encrypted token -> replace '∩' with 'M' in 'decrypt' -> output.",
  "anomalies": "The cipher is extremely simplistic and reversible; no complex encryption or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No network activity, backdoors, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a basic string replacement function for encoding and decoding tokens by substituting the character 'M' with '∩' and vice versa. There are no external dependencies, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious code patterns. The implementation is straightforward and limited to string manipulation. It does not perform any harmful operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. Its simplicity suggests it is not malicious; it could be part of a simple obfuscation or encoding scheme.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple reversible string replacements. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this implementation.",
