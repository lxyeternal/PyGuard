  "purpose": "A simple class providing character substitution encryption and decryption for the character 'M' using Unicode U+2229.",
  "sources": "Input string to encrypt or decrypt, provided as method arguments.",
  "sinks": "Return value of encrypt/decrypt methods; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input string flows into replace operation; output is the modified string returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs straightforward string replacement with no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods that perform simple character replacements: 'M' with '∩' and vice versa. There are no external dependencies, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious patterns. The implementation is trivial, with no obfuscation or security implications. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, given the straightforward nature of the code. The security risk score is 0.1, reflecting the insecurity of the substitution cipher but not indicating any malicious or dangerous behavior. The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.95), as the code is simple and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a trivial, non-malicious string substitution utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
