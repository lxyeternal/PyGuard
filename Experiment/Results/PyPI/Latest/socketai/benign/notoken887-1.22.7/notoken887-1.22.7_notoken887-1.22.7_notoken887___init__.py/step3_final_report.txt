  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution (eval, exec), environment variables, command-line arguments, external data interactions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variables, command execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or external data flow into potential sinks like network or file operations, possibly via complex control flows or obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscation, hardcoded strings, complex control flows, suspicious patterns like external data handling without clear intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as dynamic code execution and obfuscation, which are suspicious but do not confirm malicious payloads. External data interactions are noted but not malicious. Zero or low malware scores are justified for code with no confirmed malicious activity. Suspicious patterns justify moderate obfuscation and risk scores. The scores across reports are consistent with their observations, with higher suspicion in reports mentioning eval, obfuscation, and hardcoded strings. No definitive malicious behavior is observed, but patterns warrant ongoing monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows suspicious patterns like eval and obfuscation but lacks concrete evidence of malicious payloads. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall threat level remains moderate, with no active malware confirmed.",
