{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple obfuscation and deobfuscation of text strings using character replacement with emojis.",
  "sources": "Input strings to encrypt() and encrypted tokens to decrypt().",
  "sinks": "The methods perform replacements only within the provided input; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input string flows through replace operations in encrypt() to produce obfuscated output; the output can then be decrypted back to original form.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation beyond emoji replacements. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls are present. No hidden code or dynamic execution identified.",
  "analysis": "The class 'TokenCryptor' implements a basic substitution cipher using emojis to replace alphanumeric characters and some punctuation. Both encrypt() and decrypt() methods perform character replacements directly, with a symmetric mapping. No external inputs, network calls, or data leaks are evident. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as system modification, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. It is purely a cosmetic encoding scheme with no security or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of emoji-based character substitution for obfuscation. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent beyond simple encoding.",
