{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides a simple substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings using emojis as tokens.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "The methods perform string replacements directly on input data; no external sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via sequential replacements in encrypt and decrypt methods, mapping characters to emojis and back.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs straightforward character replacements; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic substitution cipher using emoji replacements for characters, which is a form of obfuscation but not encryption security. The functions are simple and deterministic, with no external inputs other than the provided strings, and no external or hidden data flows. The absence of network calls, data leakage, or system manipulation indicates no malicious intent. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation of a simple emoji-based substitution cipher with no malicious behavior or security risks. It provides basic encoding/decoding functionality without external side effects or vulnerabilities.",
