  "purpose": "Simple emoji substitution cipher encoding and decoding functions for strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks, network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via sequential replacements in encrypt() and decrypt() functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward character-to-emoji substitution with no malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs direct, deterministic replacements of characters with emojis and vice versa. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The substitution is superficial, serving as a simple obfuscation or encoding method. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The implementation is clear, consistent, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward emoji substitution utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is only mildly obfuscated, serving as a cosmetic encoding. All signals indicate a safe, non-malicious utility.",
