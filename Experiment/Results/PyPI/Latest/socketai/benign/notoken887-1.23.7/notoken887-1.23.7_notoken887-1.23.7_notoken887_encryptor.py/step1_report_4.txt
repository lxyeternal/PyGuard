{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character-based encryption and decryption by replacing alphabetic, numeric, and select punctuation characters with corresponding emoji symbols.",
  "sources": "Input data can be any string passed to encrypt() or decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "The methods process the input strings by replacing characters; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via character replacements in encrypt() and reverse replacements in decrypt(), with direct source-to-sink character substitution.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward character replacement without any obfuscation, external input handling, or hidden behavior. No hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a simple cipher based solely on character replacement with emojis. It contains no external data access, network activity, or executable code. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The structure is clear, and the functions are straightforward with no anomalies or obfuscation. Overall, this appears to be a benign encoding utility without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple character substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings using emojis. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
