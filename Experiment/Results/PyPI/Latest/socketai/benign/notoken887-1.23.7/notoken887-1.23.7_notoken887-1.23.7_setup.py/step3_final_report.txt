{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging the 'notoken887' Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No dynamic input; static metadata fields in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration, no data flow or code execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org'; description mentions obfuscation testing but no obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no obfuscated or malicious code. Metadata contains provocative contact info and URL, which are suspicious but do not affect code integrity. Malware score is 0; obfuscation score is 0. Security risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.4) due to metadata concerns. No code-based vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected. The primary concern is reputation or social engineering risk from metadata, not technical security.",
  "conclusion": "The package code is benign and standard; metadata raises suspicion but does not constitute malware or obfuscation. Scores are appropriate; no code modifications needed.",
