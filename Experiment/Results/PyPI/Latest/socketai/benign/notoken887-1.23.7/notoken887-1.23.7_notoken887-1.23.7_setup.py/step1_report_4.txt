  "flows": "N/A (no data flow or untrusted data propagation)",
  "anomalies": "Use of a suspicious email address ('hitler@gmail.com'), questionable URL ('https://thugging.org'), and a description indicating it is a test library for obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python library named 'notoken887'. There are no code injections, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. The author email and URL are potentially malicious or inappropriate, which may be intended for malicious purposes or mock/testing. No obfuscation or malware-related code is present. The setup is straightforward and typical, with no malicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script itself is a normal setup configuration with no malware or security risks in its code structure. However, the author contact info and URL are suspicious and may indicate malicious intent outside the scope of this code. Overall, the code is benign but potentially part of a malicious or questionable package due to external metadata.",
