  "sinks": "Potential system commands execution, network connections, file operations (not explicitly shown)",
  "flows": "Environment variables or user input to system commands or file operations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads environment variables and imports standard libraries. No suspicious or malicious function calls, network operations, or credential handling are evident. The code does not perform any operations that indicate malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or system compromise. It is a simple configuration or setup script with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign and straightforward.",
