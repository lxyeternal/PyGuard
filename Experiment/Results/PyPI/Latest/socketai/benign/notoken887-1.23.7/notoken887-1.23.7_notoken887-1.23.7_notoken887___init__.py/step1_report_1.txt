  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without specific comments or context, it is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters and potentially reads environment variables or external files if present.",
  "sinks": "The code may output data via return statements, write to files, or send data over network connections if included.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks, possibly passing through intermediate variables or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No suspicious network calls or unusual code constructs observed. The code does not contain obvious malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "A careful review of the code shows standard Python syntax and common programming constructs. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or code intended to damage or compromise the system. The code does not use insecure functions or unsafe practices that are typical in malicious scripts. Without specific context or external dependencies, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve legitimate functions, and no anomalies indicating sabotage or malware are present.",
