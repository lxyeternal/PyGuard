  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, system interactions, network calls, input data, module imports.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, environment variable access, system commands, file operations.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or input functions to sinks like network or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets reviewed show benign behavior, primarily reading environment variables and performing standard module imports. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The confidence in benign assessment is high (0.9), with malware and obfuscation scores at 0.0. Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern. The code structure is straightforward, with no anomalies or malicious indicators. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further issues are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears safe, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scoring accurately reflects the benign nature of the code snippets.",
