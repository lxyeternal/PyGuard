{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for a package, routing execution to different server functions based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), imported modules 'server' and 'openrec_server'",
  "sinks": "asyncio.run(server.main()), openrec_server.mcp.run()",
  "flows": "Command-line argument checked; if not 'openrec', runs server.main() via asyncio; if 'openrec', runs openrec_server.mcp.run()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Usage of asyncio and module calls appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports local modules 'server' and 'openrec_server', then defines a main() function that executes different server functions depending on the command-line argument. It uses 'asyncio.run' to execute 'server.main()', which appears to be a coroutine, and directly calls 'openrec_server.mcp.run()'. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communications to suspicious domains, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward entry point, routing to server functions based on user input. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard command-line entry point for a server-based application, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It routes to server functions depending on arguments without any suspicious activity. The overall security risk is low.",
