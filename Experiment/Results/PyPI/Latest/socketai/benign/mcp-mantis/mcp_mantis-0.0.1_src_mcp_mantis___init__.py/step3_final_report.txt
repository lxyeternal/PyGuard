  "purpose": "Command-line dispatcher for server components, selecting between running a generic server or the openrec API server based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input; imported modules 'server' and 'openrec_server' for execution.",
  "sinks": "Calls to asyncio.run(server.main()) and openrec_server.mcp.run(), which may perform network or server operations.",
  "flows": "sys.argv checked for 'openrec'; if not present, runs server.main() asynchronously; if present, runs openrec_server.mcp.run().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI dispatcher with minimal logic, relying on external modules for core functionality. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The control flow is simple, and no data leaks or security issues are evident within this snippet. External modules' security depends on their implementation, but the snippet itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard entry point for server applications with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, considering the external functions could perform network operations, but the code itself is safe.",
