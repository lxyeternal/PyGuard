{
  "purpose": "The script serves as an entry point to run either a server or an openrec API server based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, imports 'server' and 'openrec_server' modules.",
  "sinks": "Calls asyncio.run() with server.main() and openrec_server.mcp.run() functions, which could execute server code or external API calls.",
  "flows": "Command-line input from sys.argv influences whether server.main() or openrec_server.mcp.run() executes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and typical for a command-line entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an application based on command-line arguments, executing different server functions accordingly. Imports are relative, indicating it's part of a larger package. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. The functions invoked could perform network or server operations, but within this code, there are no signs of malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard CLI dispatch pattern with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as a normal application entry point to start different server components based on user input. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this code segment.",
