{
  "purpose": "The script serves as an entry point to run either a default server or an OpenREC.tv API server based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; imports modules 'server' and 'openrec_server'; calls functions 'server.main()' and 'openrec_server.mcp.run()'.",
  "sinks": "Invokes functions 'server.main()' and 'openrec_server.mcp.run()', which could potentially execute arbitrary code within those functions.",
  "flows": "Based on sys.argv input, it directs execution flow to either 'server.main()' or 'openrec_server.mcp.run()'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Usage of asyncio.run is standard. The code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script checks command-line arguments to determine which server function to run, calling either 'server.main()' or 'openrec_server.mcp.run()'. It imports local modules, indicating modular design. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior is present. Potential security concern depends entirely on the implementation of 'server.main()' and 'openrec_server.mcp.run()' functions, which are not shown here. The code itself appears benign and functional, acting as a simple dispatcher based on user input.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a basic server launcher based on command-line arguments, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks within this snippet. Its security posture depends on the implementation of imported modules, which are not provided. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe.",
