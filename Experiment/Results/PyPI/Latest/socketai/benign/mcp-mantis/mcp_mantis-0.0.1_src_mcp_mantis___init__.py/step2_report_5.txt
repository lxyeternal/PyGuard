  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a command-line entry point.\n- It imports local modules `server` and `openrec_server`.\n- Depending on `sys.argv`, it either runs `server.main()` via `asyncio.run()` or `openrec_server.mcp.run()`.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The functions invoked may perform network or server operations, but within this code, no malicious behavior is apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code appears straightforward; no errors, flaws, or malicious constructs are present.\n- **Malware & obfuscated scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's transparency.\n- **Security risk:** Reports assign low scores (~0.1), which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Functionality:** The code is a typical dispatcher for server startup routines.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, straightforward dispatch.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with confidence 1.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly higher risk score (0.1) is acceptable; no malicious concern.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, with confidence 0.9.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly higher risk score is reasonable; no issues.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Same general conclusion, confidence 0.9.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion, confidence 0.9.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- The code is a simple, transparent entry point.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws.\n- The functions called are external and their security depends on their implementation, but this cannot be inferred from the snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities, a low risk score (~0.1) is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, straightforward, and does not pose security concerns based on the provided snippet.",
