{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for a package, determining which server to run based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and imports modules 'server' and 'openrec_server'.",
  "sinks": "The code calls functions 'server.main()' and 'openrec_server.mcp.run()' which may execute server logic, but no explicit data sinks for untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "The flow depends on sys.argv; if the argument is 'openrec', it runs 'openrec_server.mcp.run()', otherwise it runs 'server.main()'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns observed. Usage of subprocess or network calls is not visible within this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it conditionally executes server startup routines based on command-line arguments. It imports modules and runs functions accordingly. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present, and no external data is processed beyond command-line input. The code does not include any data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behavior; it appears to be a normal entry script for server applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical entry point script for a server application with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply dispatches execution based on command-line arguments. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
