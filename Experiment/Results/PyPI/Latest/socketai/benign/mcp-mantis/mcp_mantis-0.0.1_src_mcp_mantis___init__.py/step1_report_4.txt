{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point that conditionally runs either a server or an openrec server based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line input; imported modules 'server' and 'openrec_server' which may contain additional code.",
  "sinks": "asyncio.run(server.main()) executes a server's main function; openrec_server.mcp.run() executes a method potentially from imported module.",
  "flows": "User input via sys.argv determines whether asyncio.run() or openrec_server.mcp.run() is executed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code. The only potential concern is the execution of imported functions which are not shown.",
  "analysis": "The script checks command-line arguments to decide which server to run. It uses asyncio.run() to execute server.main(), likely an asynchronous server start. If the argument 'openrec' is provided, it calls openrec_server.mcp.run(). There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a command-line entry point. No input validation or sanitization issues are visible, but this depends on the imported modules. Overall, the code appears benign and functional, acting as a simple dispatcher.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward command-line dispatcher for server applications with no evident malicious behavior or security issues. It dynamically runs server code based on input parameters, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations.",
