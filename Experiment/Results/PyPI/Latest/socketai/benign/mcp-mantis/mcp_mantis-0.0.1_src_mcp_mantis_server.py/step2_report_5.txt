  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as an API client/wrapper for the OpenREC platform, making HTTP GET requests to a fixed base URL, processing JSON responses, and returning structured data.\n- They emphasize that the code does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.\n- The only minor issues noted are typographical errors (e.g., 'intoduction') and commented-out code (e.g., get_yell_logs), which are benign.\n- The overall confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), and malware scores are consistently zero.\n- Security risks are rated very low (0.1 to 0.2), indicating negligible concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code matches the provided source; no discrepancies.\n- **Issues in code:** Minor typos but no logical or security flaws.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious data flows.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None identified; all flows are standard API requests and response parsing.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports. This aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but generally very low (0.1-0.2). Given the code's purpose and analysis, this seems appropriate.\n\n### Critical points:\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The code interacts solely with trusted, fixed external API endpoints.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.\n- Minor typographical issues do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Security risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, considering external API dependency but no malicious intent)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured API client for querying an external media platform. It does not perform any suspicious activities, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. The external API endpoints are fixed and appear legitimate. The responses are parsed and returned as data, with no evidence of data leaks or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe supply chain security risk for this code is very low. It is a benign, standard API wrapper with no malicious intent or behaviors. The current scores are appropriate, but I would set the malware and obfuscated scores explicitly to **0** for clarity and confidence.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0.1** (or keep as is, since it's already very low)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
