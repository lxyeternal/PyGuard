  "purpose": "API client for querying media data from the OpenREC platform via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "User-supplied parameters for search queries and external API responses.",
  "sinks": "External API endpoints and response data processing.",
  "flows": "Parameters are constructed from user input, sent via GET requests to fixed URLs, and JSON responses are parsed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typographical errors (e.g., 'intoduction') and commented-out code; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward asynchronous API wrapper making GET requests to trusted external endpoints, processing JSON responses, and returning structured data. No hardcoded secrets, malicious patterns, or obfuscation are present. Minor typos do not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning a malware score of 0 and low security risk (~0.1-0.2). The code does not exhibit suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with a legitimate API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API wrapper with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware and security risk scores are justified. Minor typographical issues are benign and do not affect security assessments.",
