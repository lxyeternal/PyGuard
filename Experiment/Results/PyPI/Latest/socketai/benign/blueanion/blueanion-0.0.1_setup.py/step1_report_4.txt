  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Bluetooth communication package named 'blueanion'.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools, codecs, os; variables defining package metadata; setup() function call with package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs are evident; the code only performs static setup configuration.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script is static and intended for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network activity, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary setup modules, defines package metadata variables, and invokes setup() with static parameters. All data used in setup() is hardcoded or derived from variables within the file. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no network operations, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package. No malicious patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to configure package metadata and dependencies. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
