  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The script solely defines package metadata and setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The script is straightforward and follows standard setup procedures. No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup functions from setuptools, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with static parameters. No external data inputs, no network calls, or dynamic code execution are involved. The code performs a standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign package configuration script.",
