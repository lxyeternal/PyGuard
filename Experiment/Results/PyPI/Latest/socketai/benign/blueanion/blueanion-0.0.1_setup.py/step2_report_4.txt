  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a standard Python package setup script.\n- It imports `setuptools`, `codecs`, and `os`.\n- Defines static variables for package metadata.\n- Calls `setup()` with these variables and `find_packages()`.\n- No dynamic code, user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved.\n- No network calls, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  **No.** All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Any mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code follows best practices for a setup script and contains no errors or flaws.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports give `0`. This is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports give `0`. This is justified, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports give `0`. The script does not perform any risky operations.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- Since the code is purely static and standard, the risk score should remain **0**.\n- No signs of malware or malicious intent justify raising the risk score.\n\n### Malware considerations:\n- The malware score is **0** in all reports, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n\n### Assumptions and claims:\n- All reports correctly identify that the script is benign and standard.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code doesn't perform any operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The code is a typical setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and follows standard practices. No further action needed.",
