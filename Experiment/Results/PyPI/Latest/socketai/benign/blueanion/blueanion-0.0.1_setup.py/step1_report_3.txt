  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Bluetooth communication Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version, author info), package discovery, and installation requirements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is sent or written from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations using setuptools. It defines package metadata, discovers packages, and specifies no external dependencies. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity is present. The code is straightforward and follows common patterns for Python package setup. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script for package distribution with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
