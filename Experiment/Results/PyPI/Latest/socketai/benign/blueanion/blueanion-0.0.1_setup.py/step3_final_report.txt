  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'blueanion', defining package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Static variables for package metadata, find_packages() function call",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or external data handling",
  "flows": "Static metadata variables used directly in setup(), no dynamic data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and conventional",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools, with static package info and no dynamic or external inputs. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code does not perform any network activity, data handling, or code execution beyond static configuration. The structure and content are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
