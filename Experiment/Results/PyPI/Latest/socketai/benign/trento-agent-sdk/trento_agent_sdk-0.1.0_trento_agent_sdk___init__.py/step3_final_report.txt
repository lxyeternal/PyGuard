  "purpose": "Simple version string assignment in a Python package",
  "sources": "Assignment to __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted input",
  "flows": "None; direct assignment without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, a common practice for versioning in Python packages. It involves no input handling, external calls, or complex logic. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code is clear, minimal, and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
