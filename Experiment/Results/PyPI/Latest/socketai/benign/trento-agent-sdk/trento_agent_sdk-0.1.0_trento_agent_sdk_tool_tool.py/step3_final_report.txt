{
  "purpose": "Provides utility for registering, describing, and executing Python functions with metadata, supporting synchronous and asynchronous functions.",
  "sources": "Function annotations, inspect.signature for parameters, function docstring for description, external call_fn_with_arg for execution.",
  "sinks": "call_fn_with_arg invoked during run; potential data leaks or malicious actions depend on its implementation and the functions passed.",
  "flows": "get_function_info extracts parameters from the function; from_function creates Tool instance; run executes the function via call_fn_with_arg with arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; reliance on external call_fn_with_arg without validation; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for function registration and execution, using standard libraries like inspect and pydantic. It extracts function metadata, supports async functions, and executes them via an external helper. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The main security concern is trusting the external call_fn_with_arg and the functions it executes, which is inherent in such a design. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.2), reflecting the potential risk of executing untrusted code but no malicious activity within the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated patterns. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of the external execution function and the functions passed in. Scores across reports are consistent and justified; no modifications are necessary.",
