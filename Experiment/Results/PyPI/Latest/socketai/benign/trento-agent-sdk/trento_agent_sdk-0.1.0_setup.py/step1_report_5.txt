{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'trento_agent_sdk' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'install_requires' list specifying dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The dependencies listed may be installed, but the code itself does not contain sinks that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Dependencies specified in 'install_requires' are fetched during package installation; no direct data flow from untrusted sources in this script.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Usage of standard setup functions and dependency listing appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. No malicious code or obfuscated patterns are present. Dependencies 'pydantic' and 'google-genai' are common libraries. No input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs are found.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
