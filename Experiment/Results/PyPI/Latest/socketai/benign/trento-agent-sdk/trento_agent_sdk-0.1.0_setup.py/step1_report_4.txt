  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'trento_agent_sdk' Python package, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input data: package metadata, package dependencies ('install_requires').",
  "sinks": "Potential sink: installation process, dependency resolution.",
  "flows": "Input data (package info, dependencies) flows through setup configuration, influencing package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Dependencies listed are common; no unusual package names or sources identified.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies. It references standard functions and common dependencies ('pydantic', 'google-genai') without obfuscation or suspicious code. No network calls, data leaks, or malicious code segments are present. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup. No anomalies or malicious indicators found.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, standard, and free of malicious intent. It properly specifies package metadata and dependencies with no suspicious behaviors.",
