  "sources": "find_packages() for package discovery, and the install_requires list for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Installation process of dependencies, package metadata handling.",
  "flows": "Source: find_packages() and install_requires; Sink: package installation and metadata processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools, with no malicious or suspicious elements. Dependencies are common packages. No data leaks, code injections, or obfuscation are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0 and low security risks (~0.1). The code's purpose is purely to configure package metadata and dependencies, with no external data flows or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe.",
