{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'trento_agent_sdk' Python SDK, specifying dependencies and package details.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the package metadata (name, version, description, author) and the list of required dependencies ('pydantic' and 'google-genai').",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or malicious behavior could originate from 'install_requires' if dependencies are compromised; otherwise, no direct sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (package info and dependencies) flows into the setup configuration, which then would be used during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is a standard setup script with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package parameters, which is common in Python packaging. The dependencies listed ('pydantic' and 'google-genai') are typical libraries and do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The structure and content follow conventional patterns for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical and benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines package metadata and dependencies using standard methods.",
