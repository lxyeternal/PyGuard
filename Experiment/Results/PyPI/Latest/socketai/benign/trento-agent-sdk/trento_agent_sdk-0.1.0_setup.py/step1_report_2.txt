{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python SDK package named 'trento_agent_sdk'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies from the 'install_requires' list and uses 'find_packages()' to locate package modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks; the code only involves package configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only sets package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns observed. The dependencies listed ('pydantic', 'google-genai') are common third-party packages.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration script using setuptools to package a Python SDK. It specifies package metadata and dependencies without any code execution or data manipulation. There are no suspicious functions, no code injection, nor any indications of malicious behavior. All elements appear typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for packaging a Python SDK. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks present.",
