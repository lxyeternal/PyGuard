  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging of the Python SDK 'trento_agent_sdk' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Import statements from setuptools, specifically find_packages and setup functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A — standard setup configuration without data flow paths involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, and no unusual behavior. The dependencies listed ('pydantic' and 'google-genai') are common packages, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script employs the standard setuptools setup pattern for Python packaging, including finding packages and defining metadata such as name, version, description, author, and required dependencies. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious activities. The dependencies are typical for AI SDKs, and no external or untrusted input handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a normal setup script for packaging a Python SDK. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
