{
  "purpose": "This code implements an agent-based system for performing simple arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction) via user input and a tool manager, utilizing asyncio for asynchronous operation.",
  "sources": "Input received from the user via input() function; data flows into messages list which is sent to the agent.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the response from the agent, but in this context, the data flows only between known functions and does not involve untrusted sinks like network or file writes.",
  "flows": "User input -> messages list -> agent processing -> pretty_print_messages (output).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity or data leaks detected. The tool functions are simple arithmetic operations with no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two basic arithmetic functions and adds them to a ToolManager. An Agent is configured to perform sums. The main async function collects user input, sends it to the agent, and prints responses, looping indefinitely. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an agent performing calculations based on user input, with no insecure or malicious elements present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign agent-based calculator application with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious anomalies detected.",
