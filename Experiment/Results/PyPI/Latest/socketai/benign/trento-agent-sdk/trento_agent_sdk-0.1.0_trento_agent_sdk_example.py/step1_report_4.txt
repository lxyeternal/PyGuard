{
  "purpose": "This code implements a simple chatbot-like agent system that performs basic arithmetic operations using tools provided via a ToolManager. The agent interacts with a user, performs sums or subtractions, and prints responses.",
  "sources": "Input from the user via the input() function in the main async loop.",
  "sinks": "The response from the agent via pretty_print_messages(), which outputs messages to the console. No untrusted data is directly sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "User input is captured and sent to the agent; the agent processes the message, executes tools (add or subtract), and responses are printed. No data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports components from 'agent.agent' and 'tool.tool_manager', but there are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. No network activity or system modifications are present. The functions are simple and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines basic arithmetic functions and registers them as tools within a ToolManager. An Agent is instantiated with instructions to perform sums. The main loop collects user input, sends it to the agent via the Swarm client, and prints the agent's response. All data handling appears standard. There are no indications of malicious data leaks, command injections, or backdoors. The code relies solely on local input/output. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code structure is simple and does not use obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, straightforward implementation of an agent performing basic arithmetic operations with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications. Overall, it is safe and free of malicious behavior.",
