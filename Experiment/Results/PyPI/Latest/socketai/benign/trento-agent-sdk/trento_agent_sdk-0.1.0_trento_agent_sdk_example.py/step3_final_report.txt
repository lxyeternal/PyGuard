  "purpose": "A simple agent-based calculator performing addition and subtraction via command-line interaction.",
  "sources": "User input via input(), messages passed to the agent framework.",
  "sinks": "Response handling within the asyncio loop; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "User input -> messages list -> agent response -> print output -> extend messages -> repeat.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports external modules for agent and tool management, defines basic arithmetic functions, adds them as tools, and runs an asynchronous loop for user interaction. It relies solely on local input/output, with no network activity or security-sensitive operations. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The indefinite loop is a design choice for a CLI tool, not a security flaw. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's benign nature is consistent with the lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of an arithmetic agent with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
