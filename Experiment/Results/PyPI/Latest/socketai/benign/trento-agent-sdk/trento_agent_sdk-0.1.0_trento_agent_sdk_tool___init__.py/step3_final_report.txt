{
  "purpose": "This code imports classes and functions from local modules, likely to be used elsewhere in the application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.tool_manager' and '.tool' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code only imports modules.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only module imports without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or external communication; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, indicating a modular design. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify this as benign, with scores reflecting no malicious intent or security risks. The code's simplicity and standard structure support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of import statements with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of malware, obfuscation, and risk are all justified as zero. No further action is necessary.",
