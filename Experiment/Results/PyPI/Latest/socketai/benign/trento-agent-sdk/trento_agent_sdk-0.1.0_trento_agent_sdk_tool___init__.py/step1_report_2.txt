  "purpose": "This code appears to import classes and functions related to tools and tool management, likely for modular or plugin-based functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .tool_manager and .tool, which are likely part of the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes and one function from local modules, which suggests modular design. There are no embedded or external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors detected. The code does not perform any actions or contain logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger, normal application structure.",
