  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing modules or classes related to tool management and tool definitions, likely for modular functionality within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .tool_manager and .tool",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external communication is evident",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there is no executable code or data flow beyond imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code only performs module imports without any additional logic or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, bringing in classes or functions from local modules. It does not include any executable logic, input handling, or data processing. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are apparent in these lines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a modular application structure.",
