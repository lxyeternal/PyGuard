{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes and functions related to an agent and message handling, likely for an AI or chatbot system.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.agent', which loads classes/functions such as pretty_print_messages, Agent, Response, Result, Swarm.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing operations are present in this snippet; the code only performs imports.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling are visible in this code fragment; it's solely an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a local module. There are no input sources, data processing, or network operations. It does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior. As this is only an import statement, it provides no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The actual behavior depends on the implementation within the 'agent' module, which is not provided here. Therefore, there is no apparent security concern based on this code snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign, and no malicious activity can be inferred from this fragment.",
