  "sources": "Importing modules and classes from a relative package, specifically from the '.agent' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and consists solely of import statements; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "This snippet performs static imports from a relative module named 'agent'. It does not process input data, perform network operations, or execute code beyond importing symbols. No signs of malicious activity or security issues are present. The code is straightforward and typical for modular Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet. It functions solely as an import statement, which is common in Python projects.",
