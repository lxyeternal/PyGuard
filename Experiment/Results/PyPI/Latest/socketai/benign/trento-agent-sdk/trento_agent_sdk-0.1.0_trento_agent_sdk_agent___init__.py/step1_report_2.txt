  "purpose": "Import statements for classes and functions related to agent behavior and message handling.",
  "sources": "Importing from a local module named 'agent' within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; only import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible from import statements alone.",
  "anomalies": "Simple import statement; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement that brings specific classes and functions from a local module. There is no data processing, input handling, or executable logic present. As such, there are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code. The import appears typical for modular Python code structure.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a benign import statement, serving to include components from a local module. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from this code fragment.",
