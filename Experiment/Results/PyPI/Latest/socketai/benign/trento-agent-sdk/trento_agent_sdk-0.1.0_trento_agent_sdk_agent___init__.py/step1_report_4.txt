{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions and classes related to an agent, likely for processing or managing messages and responses, possibly for an AI or automation system.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local package/module '.agent' which is expected to contain definitions for pretty_print_messages, Agent, Response, Result, Swarm.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions are present in this snippet; potential sinks would be within the imported module if it handles untrusted data or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly visible in this code fragment; the imported components could process data elsewhere, but none is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are evident in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple import statement from a local module named 'agent'. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions shown here. It appears to be a part of a larger project. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The imported elements' behavior cannot be assessed from this snippet alone, but the snippet itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious activity or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger codebase that deals with agent-based message processing or AI systems. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected in this fragment.",
