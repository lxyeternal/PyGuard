{
  "purpose": "To import classes and functions related to agent messaging and behavior from a local module.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module '.agent'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only imports modules.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static import without data processing or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing specific classes and functions from a local module. There is no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for a modular Python project. Given the absence of any malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security issues, the code appears benign. The imported module '.agent' could contain malicious code, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is straightforward and lacks suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are justified and accurate, reflecting the safe nature of this snippet.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
