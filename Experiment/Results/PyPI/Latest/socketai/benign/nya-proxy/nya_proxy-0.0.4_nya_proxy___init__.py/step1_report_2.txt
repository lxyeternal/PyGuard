{
  "purpose": "This module appears to serve as an initialization and import aggregator for a proxy server application called NyaProxy, providing core components, utilities, and service modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.common, .core, .dashboard, .server, .services), which are likely part of the package's internal structure.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports various modules and assigns them to __all__, facilitating easier access for users. No data flows or untrusted input handling are evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, serving as an import aggregator. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observed. It does not contain code execution, network activity, or other potentially malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a package initializer, importing key components and utilities required for the proxy application. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or execute untrusted input. The structure indicates modular design, typical for Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module initializer that organizes imports for the NyaProxy project. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is evident from this code fragment.",
