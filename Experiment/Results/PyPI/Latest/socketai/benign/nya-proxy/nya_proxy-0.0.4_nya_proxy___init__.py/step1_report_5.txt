{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up the module's main exports and import core components for a proxy API application called NyaProxy, focusing on configuration, request handling, metrics, and utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: common.models, common.utils, core.*, dashboard.api, server.*, services.*",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating processing of untrusted input directly; no data output or network connections in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not explicitly shown in this code snippet, as it mainly consists of import and export declarations without runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. All imports and exports seem standard for a modular application",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization file that imports various internal components and sets the __all__ list for module exports. There are no runtime operations, no handling of untrusted data, and no suspicious code segments present. The file's structure suggests typical Python package setup with clear modular design. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security risks are apparent in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an organized import and export interface for the NyaProxy package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks in this file.",
