{
  "purpose": "The code defines the structure and imports for the NyaProxy project, including core components, utilities, services, and configuration management, to implement a low-level API proxy with token rotation.",
  "sources": "Imports from multiple modules within the package: common.models, common.utils, core.*, dashboard.api, server.*, services.*.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network communications, file writes, or data leaks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to module imports and internal class/function references, with no evident untrusted data handling or external data sources in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are visible. The code is primarily organizational with import statements and module exports.",
  "analysis": "This code serves as an initialization and export module, defining the version and importing core components and utilities. No runtime logic, user input handling, or external data interactions are present. It appears to be a standard package __init__.py or main module file that sets up the namespace. The absence of sensitive data handling, network connections, or dynamic code execution reduces concern for malicious behavior. The code structure indicates typical package setup without suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this module. It is a standard, benign package initialization file that organizes and exposes package components.",
