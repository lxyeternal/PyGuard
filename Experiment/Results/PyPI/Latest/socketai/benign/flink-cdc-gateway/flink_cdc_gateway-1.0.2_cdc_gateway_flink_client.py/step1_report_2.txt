{
  "purpose": "Client for interacting with Apache Flink REST API, including managing jobs and deploying SQL jobs.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters (job_id, sql_statements, config), environment variables (via os module, although not used here), API responses from requests.",
  "sinks": "API request responses, logs, and potential exceptions; no direct data sinks to external systems or files in this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into API request methods; responses are processed to determine job status or results; no evident flow of untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of try-except blocks for error handling is standard. No obfuscated code detected. No dynamic code execution or suspicious behavior. Environment variables are imported but not used.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a client interacting with a REST API for Apache Flink, with functions for managing jobs and sessions. It does not contain any suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. All data flows appear to be controlled and related to normal API interactions. No anomalies such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors are present. The only potential concern is that environment variables are imported but not used, which is benign. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligned with typical API client code without indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical API client implementation for Flink with no suspicious activities detected. The risk level is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
