  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign API client with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by its standard functionality. No further action is warranted."
