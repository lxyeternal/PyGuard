  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client for managing Flink jobs, with no suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code review. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident. The code handles API requests securely, with standard error handling and logging. The only minor concern could be logs containing session handles, but this is typical for debugging and not inherently risky.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores seem appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward REST API client with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Environment variables are imported but unused, which is benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity. The use of environment variables is indirect and does not pose a security risk. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical API client with no malicious behavior, no secrets, no obfuscation. It handles job management and SQL deployment securely.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code appears benign. No signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The functionality is typical for such clients.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward client for Flink REST API, with no suspicious logic, secrets, or obfuscation. It performs expected operations.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (still low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo malicious patterns or obfuscation detected. The logging could expose some internal info, but this is standard.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client for Flink, with no signs of malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo issues found; the code is typical for such a client.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** They are very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code, typical for API clients.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard API client with minimal risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent with the code. The code is a typical, benign API client with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo further changes are necessary. The supply chain security risk for this dependency appears minimal.",
