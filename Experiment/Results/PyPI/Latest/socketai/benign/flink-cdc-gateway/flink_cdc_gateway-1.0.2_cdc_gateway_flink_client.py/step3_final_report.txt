{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a client interface for managing Apache Flink jobs via REST API, including deployment, status checks, and session management.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from API responses, session handles, job IDs, and SQL statements; no external untrusted input sources are directly used within the code.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include logs and API responses; no data is written to external untrusted locations or exfiltrated.",
  "flows": "Source: API responses and internal variables; Sink: API requests and logs; Flow: API response data used to determine next steps, such as job status or session handling.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'os' module; logging session handles and job IDs which could be sensitive, but typical for debugging; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client for Apache Flink, handling session creation, job deployment, status checks, and cancellations. It uses proper request handling, error management, and logging. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any suspicious network activity or data exfiltration. The presence of unused imports is benign. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for legitimate management of Flink jobs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign API client with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by its standard functionality. No further action is warranted.",
