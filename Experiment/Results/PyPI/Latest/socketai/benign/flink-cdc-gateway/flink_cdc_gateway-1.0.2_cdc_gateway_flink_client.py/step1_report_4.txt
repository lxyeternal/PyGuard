  "purpose": "Client for interacting with Apache Flink REST API to manage jobs, sessions, and SQL executions.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables indirectly via config; uses requests library for HTTP requests; reads user inputs for job IDs and SQL statements.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP requests to Flink REST API; executes SQL statements; cancels jobs; creates sessions.",
  "flows": "Input data (job IDs, SQL statements) flows into request functions; responses are processed to manage jobs and sessions; no data leaks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs; no backdoors detected. Use of logger and API requests is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward client implementation for Flink's REST API. It handles session creation, SQL execution, and job management using standard HTTP requests. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors. All data flows appear legitimate, and no suspicious code patterns or obfuscated logic are present. The only notable aspect is the use of logging, which is typical for such applications. Overall, the code seems to serve its intended purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, functional client for managing Flink jobs via REST API without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The security risk is minimal, and there are no indicators of malicious activity.",
