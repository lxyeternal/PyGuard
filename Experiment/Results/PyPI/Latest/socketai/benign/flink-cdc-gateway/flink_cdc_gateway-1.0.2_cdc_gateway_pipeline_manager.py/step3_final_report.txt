  "purpose": "Manage data pipelines for CDC Gateway, including creation, starting, stopping, deletion, and status monitoring, with SQL generation for Flink jobs.",
  "sources": "Filesystem JSON files for pipeline definitions, environment variable placeholders for credentials, external FlinkClient interactions.",
  "sinks": "Flink SQL statements executing on external systems, with connection info embedded via placeholders.",
  "flows": "Pipeline definitions loaded from files -> SQL generated with placeholders -> FlinkClient deploys jobs -> Status updates and control commands via FlinkClient.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholders like '${MSSQL_USERNAME}' and '${MSSQL_PASSWORD}' for credentials; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; standard error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code manages pipelines through filesystem persistence, generates SQL with runtime environment variable placeholders, and interacts with Flink for deployment and monitoring. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is present. The placeholders are standard for secret injection, not malicious. Error handling and logging are typical. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects potential misconfiguration or external dependency risks but not inherent maliciousness. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The code structure is clear, and the logic is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured pipeline management module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The use of placeholders for secrets aligns with best practices. The low security risk score is justified. Overall, the code poses minimal security concerns.",
