  "purpose": "Monitor service for CDC pipelines, managing and logging pipeline statuses.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (CONFIG_PATH, FLINK_JOBMANAGER_HOST, FLINK_JOBMANAGER_PORT), configuration file (YAML loaded via safe_load).",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs (info, error, debug logs).",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> configuration file -> FlinkClient and PipelineManager initialization -> monitoring loop with status checks and logging.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for configuration, but no hardcoded credentials or secrets. No suspicious code patterns. The code performs standard monitoring functions without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script loads configuration data from environment variables and a YAML file, then initializes monitoring clients. It runs an indefinite loop that periodically checks pipeline statuses and logs information. No data is sent over the network beyond typical client interactions with Flink and pipeline managers. The code does not perform any file or system modifications, nor does it contain any suspicious or obfuscated code. It includes signal handling for graceful shutdown, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. Usage of safe YAML parsing (safe_load) indicates good security practice. Overall, the code appears to be a standard monitoring script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical monitoring service for CDC pipelines, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It securely loads configurations, handles signals properly, and performs standard monitoring operations. No malicious or suspicious activities are detected.",
