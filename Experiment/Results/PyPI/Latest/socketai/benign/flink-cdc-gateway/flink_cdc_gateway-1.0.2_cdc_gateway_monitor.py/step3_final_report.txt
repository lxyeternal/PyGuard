  "purpose": "Monitoring service for CDC pipelines, periodically checking and updating pipeline statuses.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (CONFIG_PATH, FLINK_JOBMANAGER_HOST, FLINK_JOBMANAGER_PORT), configuration file loaded from disk.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; primarily logs and external client interactions.",
  "flows": "Configuration loaded from environment and file -> Initialization of clients -> Periodic status checks -> Logging outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward monitoring script that loads configuration from environment variables and YAML files, initializes external clients (FlinkClient, PipelineManager), handles signals for graceful shutdown, and periodically updates pipeline statuses with logging. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of environment variables and external configs is standard practice, and no network activity beyond legitimate client interactions is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured monitoring utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk between 0.1 and 0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code analysis.",
