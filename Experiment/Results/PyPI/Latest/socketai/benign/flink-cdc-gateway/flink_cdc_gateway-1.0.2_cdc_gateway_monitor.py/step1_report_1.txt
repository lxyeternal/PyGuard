  "purpose": "Monitor service for CDC pipelines, managing pipeline statuses and logging information.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (CONFIG_PATH, FLINK_JOBMANAGER_HOST, FLINK_JOBMANAGER_PORT), configuration file loaded from disk.",
  "sinks": "Potentially logs errors and info; no direct data leaks or sensitive output observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and config file → FlinkClient and PipelineManager initialization → Monitoring loop with periodic status checks and logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic code execution. Usage of environment variables is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration from a specified path, initializes external clients, and enters a loop to monitor pipelines. It handles signals for graceful shutdown. The environment variables used are typical for configuration purposes. No suspicious code patterns, no malicious network connections, or data exfiltration observed. The only potential concern could be the reliance on environment variables and config files, but these are standard. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The code appears to be a straightforward monitoring script.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign monitoring utility for CDC pipelines. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code. No malicious intent detected.",
