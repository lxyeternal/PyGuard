  "purpose": "Monitor service for CDC pipelines, managing and logging pipeline statuses.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from environment variables and YAML file; reads signals for shutdown.",
  "sinks": "Logs information and errors; potentially interacts with external Flink cluster via FlinkClient.",
  "flows": "Reads config from environment and file -> initializes clients -> periodically fetches pipeline status -> logs data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no suspicious or unusual code structures; standard signal handling and logging.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs configuration loading, client initialization, signal handling, and periodic status monitoring. It securely reads environment variables for configuration, uses YAML for config data, and handles signals properly. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is evident. Usage of external clients appears standard, with no indication of malicious intent. The code structure and flow are typical for a monitoring service. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard monitoring script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It operates as intended for a pipeline monitoring system, with no suspicious activity or malicious code detected.",
