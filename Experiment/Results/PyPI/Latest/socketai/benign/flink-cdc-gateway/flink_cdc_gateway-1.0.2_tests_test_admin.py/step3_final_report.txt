  "purpose": "Unit tests for Flask endpoints in cdc_gateway.admin, verifying health, metrics, and info responses with mocked dependencies.",
  "sources": "Mocked external dependencies such as pipeline_manager, generate_latest, os.path.exists, os.listdir, psutil.virtual_memory, psutil.cpu_percent, os.uname",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted, no external system modifications, no data leaks, no network connections, no file writes or reads involving untrusted input",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke Flask test client requests which trigger endpoint handlers that rely on mocked functions and system calls, with no untrusted data flowing into sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard testing practices, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite for Flask endpoints, utilizing mocks to simulate environment and dependencies. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The tests verify endpoint responses and system info without processing untrusted input or performing external actions. The use of mocks ensures safety and isolation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are detected. The code structure and logic are typical for testing frameworks, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard unit testing suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are justified and accurate, indicating no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns.",
