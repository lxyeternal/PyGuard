  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Flask app endpoints in cdc_gateway.admin module",
  "sources": "Mocked external functions and modules: pipeline_manager, generate_latest, os.path.exists, os.listdir, psutil.virtual_memory, psutil.cpu_percent, os.uname",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data leaks or untrusted data effects are produced in the test code itself",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke API endpoints which internally call mocked functions, with no untrusted data flow or external data processing",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code mainly sets up mocks and verifies endpoint responses.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard unit testing for a Flask application, with extensive use of mocking to simulate environment and external dependencies. There are no signs of malicious code or backdoors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed. The code's structure and content are typical for testing scenarios, with no indication of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate test code for verifying Flask API endpoints with mocks. No malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks identified.",
