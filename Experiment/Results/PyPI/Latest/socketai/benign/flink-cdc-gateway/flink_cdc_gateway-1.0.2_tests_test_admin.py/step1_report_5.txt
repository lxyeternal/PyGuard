  "sources": "Test client requests to Flask endpoints; mock objects provide data for system information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is written or transmitted; no data leaks or untrusted sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Test client requests trigger endpoint functions, which utilize mocked system info; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets detected. The test code is standard and uses common testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard unit tests for a Flask app, utilizing mocking for external system calls and dependencies. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. All dependencies are mocked; no external or untrusted input is processed in a harmful way. The code appears to serve solely as test cases with no malicious intent or malicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of unit tests for the Flask application endpoints with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It is safe and does not contain malware or security risks.",
