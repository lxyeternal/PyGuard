  "purpose": "Unit tests for the cdc_gateway.admin Flask application endpoints, including /health, /metrics, and /info.",
  "sources": "Mocked functions and external modules such as 'pipeline_manager', 'generate_latest', 'os.path.exists', 'os.listdir', 'psutil.virtual_memory', 'psutil.cpu_percent', and 'os.uname'.",
  "sinks": "Response data returned via Flask test client, no untrusted data sinks such as network transmissions or file writes are directly involved in this code.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke mocked functions to simulate system and application behaviors, then validate responses; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is standard unit testing with mock setups.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for Flask application endpoints, using mock objects to simulate system states and dependencies. No user input, untrusted data, or potentially malicious code execution exists. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The mocks do not include malicious code, and the tests are isolated from the actual system, focusing only on response validation. Overall, the code appears safe and does not exhibit any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard unit testing script for a Flask app, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly tests endpoint responses using mocks, with no dangerous code, data leaks, or backdoors present.",
