  "purpose": "Unit tests for the cdc_gateway.admin Flask application endpoints",
  "sources": "Test cases mock external dependencies and filesystem interactions, including pipeline_manager, os.path.exists, os.listdir, psutil.virtual_memory, psutil.cpu_percent, and os.uname",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or data leaks identified; responses are constructed from controlled mock data",
  "flows": "Mocked dependencies supply data to response construction; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks or system calls",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. Use of mocks and fixtures is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests designed to verify the behavior of Flask endpoints in a controlled environment. All external dependencies are mocked to prevent interaction with real system resources or networks. No code performs data exfiltration, system modifications, or malicious actions. The test setup, mocks, and assertions follow standard practices for testing Flask applications. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of unit tests with mocked dependencies to validate endpoint responses. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a safe, standard test suite for a Flask application.",
