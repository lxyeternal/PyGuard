  "purpose": "Minimal package initialization script containing only a docstring and version string.",
  "sources": "No data input, output, or external data sources; only a docstring and a version assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines a string and a docstring without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module with a docstring and a version string assignment. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external communication. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's transparency and minimalism justify the conclusion that it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal package initializer with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as safe. No adjustments or further analysis are necessary.",
