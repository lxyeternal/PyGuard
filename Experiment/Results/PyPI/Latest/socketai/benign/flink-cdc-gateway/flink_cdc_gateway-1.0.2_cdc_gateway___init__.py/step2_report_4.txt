  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal module initialization file containing only a docstring and a version string.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external communications, or executable logic.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious, obfuscated, or insecure.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - Based on the code, no issues are present. The reports consistently confirm the benign nature of this minimal package setup.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware and Risk Assessment**:\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, the malware score of 0 is justified.\n   - The risk score of 0 is appropriate; the code poses no security threat.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 aligns with the code's transparency.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The reports are thorough and do not overstate potential issues.\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that aren't supported by the code.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Final note**: Given the simplicity of the code, I agree with the current scores. No adjustments are necessary.",
