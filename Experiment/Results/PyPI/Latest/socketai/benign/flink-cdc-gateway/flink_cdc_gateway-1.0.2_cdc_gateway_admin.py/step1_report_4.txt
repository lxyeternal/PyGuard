  "purpose": "Provides a Flask-based administrative API for managing and monitoring a CDC Gateway, including health checks, metrics, and system info.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., CONFIG_PATH, FLINK_JOBMANAGER_HOST, CDC_GATEWAY_ADMIN_PORT), configuration files (YAML), file system (pipeline JSON files), pipeline_manager.get_all_pipelines() method.",
  "sinks": "None directly observable; no apparent data leaks or sensitive data transmission within this code.",
  "flows": "Configuration paths read from environment and filesystem → configuration variables used throughout the app → system metrics gathered from psutil → data returned via API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for configuration is standard; no suspicious hardcoded secrets. No obfuscated code or hidden dynamic execution detected. Some debug logs are enabled but do not pose security risk. The code reads system info and pipeline states; no signs of malicious data manipulation or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Flask app for system monitoring and pipeline management. It loads configuration from multiple sources, uses environment variables for host and port configurations, and exposes health, metrics, and info endpoints. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The only potential concern is reliance on external pipeline_manager methods, but these are context-dependent and not inherently malicious. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The code appears secure with respect to supply chain threats; it does not process untrusted user input beyond API request parameters, and no unsafe eval or dynamic code execution is used.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard monitoring and management Flask application with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include malicious payloads, backdoors, or data leaks. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is low. It primarily reads system info and configuration data for monitoring purposes.",
