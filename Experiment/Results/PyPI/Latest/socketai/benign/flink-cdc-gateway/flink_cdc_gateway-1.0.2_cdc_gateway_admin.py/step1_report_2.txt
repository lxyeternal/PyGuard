{
  "purpose": "Provides a Flask-based administrative API for CDC Gateway, including health checks, metrics, and system info.",
  "sources": "Configuration files (yaml), environment variables, system calls (psutil), file system (os.listdir), environment variables for host and port, HTTP request inputs.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, configuration loading, system commands (psutil), response outputs, environment variables used for configuration, metric data output.",
  "flows": "Configuration paths read from environment variables and filesystem, environment variables influence external service hosts/ports, system info gathered and sent in responses, metrics exposed via Prometheus.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for configuration; no explicit hardcoded credentials or secrets; the code is primarily standard Flask app with metrics and system info endpoints; no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Flask app with several endpoints for health, metrics, and info, loading configuration from multiple sources. It accesses system metrics via psutil and exposes them. It also optionally interacts with external components like pipeline_manager and flink_client if available. The environment variables used (e.g., for ports, hostnames) are typical for configurable deployments. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform any network connections to untrusted domains, does not contain hardcoded secrets, nor executes any commands that could be malicious. It mainly reads configuration, system metrics, and responds with JSON data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard administrative API service for a CDC gateway, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. It uses environment variables and config files for configuration, gathers system info, and exposes metrics securely. No malicious behavior or backdoors are detected.",
