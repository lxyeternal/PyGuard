{
  "purpose": "Provides health, metrics, and info endpoints for system monitoring and pipeline status in a Flask application.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, configuration files, and system metrics via psutil; reads pipeline files from a directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no network connections to external domains or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from environment variables/files into app setup; system metrics flow from psutil to endpoints; pipeline info flows from pipeline_manager or filesystem to response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; optional external modules are imported with exception handling, indicating flexible deployment but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Flask app that loads configuration from environment variables, files, or defaults, and exposes health, metrics, and info endpoints. It gathers system metrics via psutil, reads pipeline info either from a pipeline manager or filesystem, and exposes Prometheus metrics. No malicious behaviors such as network connections to suspicious domains, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. External dependencies are standard and handled gracefully if missing. The code does not contain obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. Overall, the code is well-structured, with no indicators of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard monitoring API with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are accurate and justified based on the analysis.",
