  "purpose": "Set up the 'tests' directory as a Python package for testing the Flink CDC Gateway.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; static code defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code is purely declarative and structural.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a descriptive comment, a version string assignment, and no executable logic. It does not include data input/output, dynamic execution, or any suspicious patterns. It is a standard module initialization file for a Python package, primarily serving to make the directory a package and declare its version.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple package marker with no malicious intent or security risks.",
