  "purpose": "Initialize the 'tests' directory as a Python package and declare its version.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; only a docstring and a version string declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static code with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module consisting solely of a descriptive docstring and a version string assignment. It serves as a package marker with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and purpose are clear, and there are no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All assessments are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.",
