  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no executable logic involved.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only comments and a version string; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely boilerplate for setting up a test package. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose, a version string, and no functional or executable code. No input/output, data processing, or external calls are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
