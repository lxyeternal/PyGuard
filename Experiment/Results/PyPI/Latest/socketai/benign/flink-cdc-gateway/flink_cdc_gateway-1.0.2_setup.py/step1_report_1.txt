{
  "purpose": "This script is used for configuring and packaging a Python project named 'flink-cdc-gateway'. It reads version info, long description, and specifies dependencies and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version from __init__.py; reads README.md for long description; defines dependencies inline.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; the code primarily handles static configuration and file reading.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from __init__.py -> uses in setup() call; reads long description -> used in setup() -> no data flow to external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup configuration tasks: reading version info and long description, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. It uses static file reading with no user input or untrusted data sources. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All dependencies and configurations appear typical for a Python packaging script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.",
