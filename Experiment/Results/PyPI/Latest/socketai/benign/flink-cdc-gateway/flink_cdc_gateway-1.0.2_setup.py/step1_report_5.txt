  "purpose": "The script sets up the packaging configuration for a Python project, specifying metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "File reads for __init__.py and README.md, static requirements list, setup() arguments",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data processing observed",
  "flows": "Reading version info and long description, then passing data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: reading version info from a file, reading README content, defining fixed requirements, and configuring setup() parameters. No user input, network access, or dynamic code execution occurs. The code structure is typical for a Python package setup script. No anomalies, malicious functions, or backdoors are present. The code adheres to best practices for a package setup script and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard, benign package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
