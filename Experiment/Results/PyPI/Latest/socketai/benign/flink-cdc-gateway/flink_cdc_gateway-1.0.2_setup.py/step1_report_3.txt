  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'flink-cdc-gateway' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading version from __init__.py, reading long description from README.md, defining dependencies, and setting up package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script primarily handles static file reading and package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file, reads long description, and defines dependencies for setup; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected. The code adheres to standard setup.py practices.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version info from a specific file, loads project description, specifies fixed dependencies, and configures setup parameters. It does not process user input, network data, or perform any runtime logic beyond package configuration. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident in the code structure or content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.",
