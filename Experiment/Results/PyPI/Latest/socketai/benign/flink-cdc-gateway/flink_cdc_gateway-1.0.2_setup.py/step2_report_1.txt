  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- No dynamic or untrusted data sources are involved.\n- The code reads version info and description from local files.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code content.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 in all reports, which is correct given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code reads version info from `__init__.py` and description from `README.md`. It defines dependencies explicitly and sets up entry points. All logic is static and typical for a setup script.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, backdoors, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the script doesn't process user input or external data beyond static file reads.\n- **Data sinks or data flows:** Only static file reads and package configuration, no external data handling.\n\n### Issues or anomalies:\n\n- None detected in the code itself.\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments, with high confidence levels.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring justifications:\n\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Code is clear, straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score (0):** No security risks identified; the script is purely for packaging.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nBased on the code and the reports, I concur with the provided scores and conclusions. The code is a benign, standard setup.py script with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe and typical for its purpose.",
