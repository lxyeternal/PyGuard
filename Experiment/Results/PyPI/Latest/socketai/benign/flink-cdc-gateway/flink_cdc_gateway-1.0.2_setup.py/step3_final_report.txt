  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, defining dependencies, reading version info, and setting entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads version from __init__.py, long description from README.md, static dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "None; static file reads and package configuration only.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static configuration data used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script performing static file reads and package configuration. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling is present. The dependencies are explicitly listed, and no suspicious patterns or secrets are embedded. All signals point to benign, standard packaging behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores (0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk) are justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
