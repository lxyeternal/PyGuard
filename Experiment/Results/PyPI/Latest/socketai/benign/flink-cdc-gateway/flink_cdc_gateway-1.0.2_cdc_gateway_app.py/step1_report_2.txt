{
  "purpose": "Main Flask application for managing CDC pipelines and interacting with Flink cluster",
  "sources": "Environment variables (FLINK_JOBMANAGER_HOST, FLINK_JOBMANAGER_PORT, CDC_GATEWAY_PORT), configuration files, request JSON payloads",
  "sinks": "Request JSON bodies (for creating/importing pipelines), environment variables, configuration files",
  "flows": "Environment variables and configuration files are read as sources; request JSON data flows into pipeline creation, import, start, stop, delete functions; no direct untrusted data flows into critical security-sensitive functions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Use of environment variables and config files is standard. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or misleading variable names. All external inputs are handled properly via Flask request objects. Logging is standard. No malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Flask API setup for managing data pipelines, with configuration loading, environment variable usage, and request handling. All user input is processed via Flask request context, and no suspicious dynamic code execution, credential handling, or network communication indicative of malware is present. External dependencies are used appropriately, with no malicious payloads evident. Error handling and logging are implemented conventionally. The code appears to be a typical backend API service with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard Flask application for pipeline management with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely handles inputs and configuration, with no suspicious code or data leaks. Overall, the code appears safe and free from malware.",
