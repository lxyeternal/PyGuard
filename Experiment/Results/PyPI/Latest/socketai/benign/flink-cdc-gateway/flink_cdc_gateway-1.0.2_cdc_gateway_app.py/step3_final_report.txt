  "purpose": "API for managing data pipelines and health checks within CDC Gateway system",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., FLINK_JOBMANAGER_HOST, FLINK_JOBMANAGER_PORT, CDC_GATEWAY_PORT), configuration files (YAML), request JSON payloads",
  "sinks": "Error messages returned in JSON responses, request JSON payloads (potential for injection if not validated), environment variables (potential misconfiguration)",
  "flows": "Request data flows from client to API endpoints, which invoke pipeline_manager methods; configuration data flows from environment variables and files into app setup; error messages may leak info back to clients",
  "anomalies": "Use of Hebrew comments in code, potential info leakage via exception messages, lack of explicit input validation on JSON payloads, configuration loaded from multiple sources including environment variables",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Flask API managing pipelines with configuration loaded from environment variables, YAML files, and defaults. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external calls are present. Error handling returns exception messages that could leak sensitive info. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are detected. External dependencies are not detailed but assumed safe. The risk of malicious activity is negligible; scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are justified. Slightly elevated risk scores (up to 0.3) reflect potential info leakage and configuration concerns, but these do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured Flask API with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily related to error message info leakage and configuration handling, which are common issues in such systems. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code review.",
