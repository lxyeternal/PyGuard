  "purpose": "Main Flask application for CDC Gateway API, managing pipelines and interfacing with Flink.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ), reading configuration files (yaml.safe_load), receiving JSON request bodies (request.json).",
  "sinks": "Returning JSON responses; potentially exposing internal errors via error messages; no explicit data sinks that send data over network except normal API responses.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and config files influences application behavior; HTTP request data flows into backend functions; responses are sent back to clients.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Hebrew comments in configuration loading; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no evident malicious code or unusual behavior; exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Flask API with endpoints for pipeline management and health checks. It loads configuration files from multiple paths with fallback defaults, which is typical. Environment variables are used for configuring Flink client connection parameters, but no sensitive data like credentials are hardcoded. Request data is received via JSON payloads and returned as JSON responses; no direct data leaks or insecure data handling observed. Error handling is standard, with exception messages returned in JSON format. No suspicious external calls, network connections, or hidden behaviors are evident. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Flask application for pipeline management, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. Its logic is transparent, and there are no indications of sabotage or malware.",
