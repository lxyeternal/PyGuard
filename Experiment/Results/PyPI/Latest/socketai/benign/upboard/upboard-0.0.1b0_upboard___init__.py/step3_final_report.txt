  "purpose": "Define static metadata for the 'Update-Board' CLI tool, including version, status, author, project name, URL, and formatted version string.",
  "sources": "None; static variable assignments with no external data inputs or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; static assignments without data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden logic, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for project metadata, with no dynamic inputs, external calls, or executable logic. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, metadata-only, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the static and transparent nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code poses no security risks. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is straightforward and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, serving purely as project metadata. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
