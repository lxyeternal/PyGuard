  "purpose": "Define metadata for the Update-Board CLI tool, including version, status, author, and project information.",
  "sources": "The module assigns string values to variables and constructs a formatted string for projectVersion.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; variables are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains no obfuscated patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports no external modules, performs simple string assignments, and constructs a version string from predefined constants. It does not execute any external code, access environment variables, or perform network operations. The code appears to serve as metadata for a CLI tool, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, containing only static variable definitions for project metadata. There are no signs of malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.",
