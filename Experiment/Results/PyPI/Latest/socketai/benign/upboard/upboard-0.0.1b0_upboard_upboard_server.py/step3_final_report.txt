  "purpose": "A Flask-based server facilitating file uploads and downloads for software releases, with optional password protection.",
  "sources": "Request headers for authorization, request.files for uploaded files, command-line arguments for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem operations for saving and deleting files, send_from_directory for serving files, request headers for auth validation.",
  "flows": "Authorization header → auth_required decorator → file upload handling → file storage in structured directories → file retrieval via send_from_directory.",
  "anomalies": "Use of plaintext password for authentication, minimal input validation, reliance on secure_filename for filename sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward file server with basic authentication. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. The main security concern is the use of plaintext passwords and minimal validation, which could lead to security vulnerabilities if not properly secured via HTTPS. The filename sanitization mitigates directory traversal risks. No suspicious behaviors or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a functional, benign update server with moderate security risks due to simplistic authentication and minimal validation. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk score is approximately 0.3, consistent with the analysis, and malware and obfuscated scores are 0.",
