  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows; only module imports and logger configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string, configures basic logging, and imports two local modules ('pondcleaner' and 'demo'). There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no hidden or obfuscated code. It appears to be standard package setup code with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module setup snippet with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
