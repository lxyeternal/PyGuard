  "purpose": "Initialize logging configuration and import modules from the same package",
  "sources": "Logging setup, import statements",
  "sinks": "None evident; no handling of untrusted input or sensitive data",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; imports are from local modules",
  "analysis": "The code sets a package version, configures basic logging, and imports modules from the current package. No user input, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present. The imports suggest the package includes 'pondcleaner' and 'demo' modules, but without their contents, there is no indication of malicious intent. The logging setup is standard and does not pose security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package initialization with logging and module imports. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet.",
