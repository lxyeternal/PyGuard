  "purpose": "Package initialization with versioning, logging configuration, and local module imports.",
  "sources": "Reads version string, sets up logging, imports local modules (.pondcleaner, .demo).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Initialization flows from version and logging setup to module imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (`from .pondcleaner import *`, `from .demo import *`) which can obscure imported content.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, serving as a package setup script. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns are present. Wildcard imports are a potential concern as they can hide malicious code in imported modules, but without inspecting those modules, this remains speculative. The code does not contain obfuscation, dynamic execution, or external data handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the context. The overall structure and content suggest a benign package initialization with a minor concern regarding import practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the use of wildcard imports, which warrants further review of the imported modules but does not constitute a security risk based solely on this snippet.",
