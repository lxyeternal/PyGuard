  "purpose": "Define a simple function that prints a message indicating the demo worked fine.",
  "sources": "The function does not read any external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden logic, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code declares an all-in list with a single item, 'dt_pc_demo'. It defines a function that prints a message when called. There are no external data sources, no data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be a benign demonstration or placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, simple, and appears intended for demonstration purposes. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
