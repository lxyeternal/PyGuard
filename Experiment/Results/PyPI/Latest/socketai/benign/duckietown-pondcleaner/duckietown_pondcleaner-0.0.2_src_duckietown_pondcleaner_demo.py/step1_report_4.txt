  "purpose": "Define a simple function that prints a message indicating a demo has worked.",
  "sources": "No input sources; no external data reads.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data leakage or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; function only prints a message locally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward function with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an export list '__all__' containing a single item and a function 'dt_pc_demo' that prints a message. There are no input sources, no data manipulation, no external calls, and no security-sensitive operations. The code appears to be a simple demonstration or placeholder without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
