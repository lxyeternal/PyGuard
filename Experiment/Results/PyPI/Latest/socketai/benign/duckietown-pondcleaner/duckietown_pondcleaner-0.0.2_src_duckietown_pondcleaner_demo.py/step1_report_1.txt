  "purpose": "Simple demonstration function that prints a message.",
  "sources": "No input or external data read; static code.",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs data to stdout.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; function simply prints static text.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an __all__ variable to specify exported symbols, which is standard for Python modules. The function dt_pc_demo() prints a static message and does not perform any data processing, input handling, or network operations. No code indicates malicious intent or malicious behavior. The overall structure and content are straightforward and typical for a simple demonstration module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be a basic, harmless example or placeholder function.",
