  "purpose": "A simple demonstration function that prints a static message.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static code with no input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list __all__ with a single function dt_pc_demo() that prints a message. It contains no inputs, external data, network calls, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of security concerns. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
