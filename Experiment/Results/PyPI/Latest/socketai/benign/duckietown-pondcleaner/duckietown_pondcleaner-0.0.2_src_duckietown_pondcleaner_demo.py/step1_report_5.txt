  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; function only prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list __all__ for module exports and a function dt_pc_demo that prints a static message. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. No external dependencies or data interactions are present, and the code performs a benign print operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, harmless demonstration function with no malicious intent or security risks.",
