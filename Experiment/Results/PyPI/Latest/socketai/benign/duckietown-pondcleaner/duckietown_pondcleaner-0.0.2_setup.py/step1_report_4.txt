  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'duckietown_pondcleaner', configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version from source file, importing modules, and defining configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data; no code execution with untrusted input or network activities.",
  "flows": "The code reads version info from a source file; no flow from untrusted input to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The version extraction method is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations, including reading the version from a source file and defining dependencies. The version reading uses ast parsing, which is safe. No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures. The only potential concern is the check for '<' in package_name', but it's a safeguard against incomplete data, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs typical package configuration tasks safely.",
