  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'duckietown_pondcleaner' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads project metadata, dependencies, and version information from files and variables.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sinks or external data outputs identified.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from source files; uses static data for package configuration; no flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. The code is straightforward package setup logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, defines package metadata, reads version info from a source file, specifies dependencies, and configures setup parameters. All operations are typical for a setup script. No external inputs or untrusted data are processed dynamically; no code executes untrusted code or performs network operations. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No malicious or suspicious code detected.",
