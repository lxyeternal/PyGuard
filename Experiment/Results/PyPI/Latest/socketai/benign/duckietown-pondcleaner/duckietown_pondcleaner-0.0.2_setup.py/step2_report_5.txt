  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n- It reads version info from a source file using AST parsing, which is a common and safe practice.\n- Dependencies are specified as broad requirements, no external data sources or network calls during setup.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The only minor concern is the check `if \"<\" in package_name:` which is a safeguard against incomplete data, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues are present.\n- **Malicious code or backdoors:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Suspicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the individual reports:\n\n**Report 1-5:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script.\n- They note the safe version extraction, standard dependency specification, and lack of suspicious patterns.\n- They do not identify any malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very close to it, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n### Any discrepancies or unreasonable scores?\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a typical, safe `setup.py` script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
