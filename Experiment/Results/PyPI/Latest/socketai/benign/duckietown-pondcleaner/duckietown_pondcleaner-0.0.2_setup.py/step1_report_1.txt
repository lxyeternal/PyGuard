{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package named 'duckietown_pondcleaner' for distribution via PyPI, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads project metadata, version info from a source file, and dependencies from hardcoded lists.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe file reading in 'get_version_from_source', but no untrusted data sources are used at runtime.",
  "flows": "File reading in 'get_version_from_source' -> metadata assignment in setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup operations: importing modules, defining metadata, reading version info from a source file, and configuring dependencies. The version extraction reads from a specific source file with standard AST parsing, which is safe if the source file is trusted. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior. It securely reads version information, manages dependencies, and defines package entry points without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
