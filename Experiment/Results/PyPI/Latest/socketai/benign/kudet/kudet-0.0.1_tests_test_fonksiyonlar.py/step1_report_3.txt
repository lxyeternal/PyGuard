{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize and configure a web server or application, potentially for serving or processing data.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules, possibly reading user input or configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Network requests, file operations, or system calls that could send or write data.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or user input flows into network communication or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, unusual obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. No suspicious network connections or code execution patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup routines: importing modules, configuring settings, and possibly starting services. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The structure appears standard for a web application. The absence of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious functions suggests this is a benign package. The focus on configuration and setup functions aligns with common application patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard configuration or initialization script without malicious intent.",
