  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a Python package module intended for general functionality or library use.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from standard input, environment variables, or package parameters. No explicit external input sources are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls if present, but none are evident in this snippet. Usage of eval or exec functions would be notable if found.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions and possibly to outputs like files or network, but specific flow paths are not explicitly shown in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious string patterns, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual dynamic execution or misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python with no signs of malicious constructs. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated sections. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious in itself. No unsafe practices like insecure SQL or dangerous eval/exec are evident. The code structure and content are consistent with normal package code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no apparent malicious behaviors or security risks. The code seems benign, with no indicators of malware, data leakage, or sabotage. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
