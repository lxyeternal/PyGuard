  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "No explicit external input or data sources identified; code snippets or behaviors not provided.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks such as network connections, file writes, or eval/exec calls observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected due to lack of code or suspicious patterns.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or suspicious constructs; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate the code is benign, with no malicious constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the descriptions. High confidence (0.9) in the assessments where code is available, and low confidence (0.1) where code is missing, are appropriate. The reasoning across reports is consistent and justified based on the provided summaries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
