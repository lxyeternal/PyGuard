  "purpose": "Simple arithmetic operations: addition and subtraction functions.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'a' and 'b' (inputs to the functions).",
  "sinks": "Return statements output the computed values; no external sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly to the return statements without any manipulation or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No use of external libraries, environment variables, or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward functions performing addition and subtraction. There are no external data sources, no injection points, and no suspicious code behavior. The functions are pure and simple, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious data handling. The structure and format are standard and do not suggest obfuscation or malicious modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving basic arithmetic functions with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
