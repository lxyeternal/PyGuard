  "purpose": "Basic mathematical functions for addition and subtraction",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' passed to functions",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting computed values",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> calculations -> return outputs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and performs simple operations",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for adding and subtracting two floating-point numbers. There are no input sanitization, external data reads, or untrusted data sources. The functions only perform basic arithmetic and return the result. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is minimal, clean, and consistent with standard practices for such functions. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple implementation of addition and subtraction functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic arithmetic and does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
