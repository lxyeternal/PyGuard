{
  "purpose": "The code provides basic arithmetic functions for addition and subtraction of two numbers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' in the functions 'add' and 'subtract'.",
  "sinks": "Return statements output the result of the computations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the functions and directly to the return statements; no external data flows or processing involved.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward functions performing addition and subtraction. It does not include any input validation, external data access, or side effects. There are no signs of malicious logic, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities. The simplicity and clarity of the functions suggest they serve basic arithmetic purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, implementing simple arithmetic functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
