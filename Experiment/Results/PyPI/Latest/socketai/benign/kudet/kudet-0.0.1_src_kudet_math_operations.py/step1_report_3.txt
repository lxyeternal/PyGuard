  "purpose": "Basic mathematical functions for addition and subtraction",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' passed directly to functions",
  "sinks": "Return statements output the computed result; no external data or untrusted sources involved",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow into addition/subtraction operations and then are returned",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; simple arithmetic operations with no external dependencies or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code defines two straightforward functions for addition and subtraction. Both functions accept float inputs and return their sum or difference. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, file operations, or data leaks. The code does not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to injection or data exfiltration. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident. The code structure is simple, clear, and typical for mathematical utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains basic arithmetic functions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not pose a supply chain security threat.",
