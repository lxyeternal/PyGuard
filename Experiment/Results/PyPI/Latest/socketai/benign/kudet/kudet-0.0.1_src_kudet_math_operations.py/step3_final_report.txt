  "purpose": "Basic arithmetic functions for addition and subtraction.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'a' and 'b' received as input arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions return computed results directly.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow into arithmetic operations, returning the sum or difference.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward functions performing addition and subtraction on float inputs. There are no external dependencies, no suspicious behaviors, and no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The functions are simple, with clear input and output flows, and no external data sources or sinks. The code is benign, with scores reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and poses no security or supply chain risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
