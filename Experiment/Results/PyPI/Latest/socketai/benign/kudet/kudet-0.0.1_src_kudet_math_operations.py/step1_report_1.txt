  "purpose": "Basic arithmetic functions for addition and subtraction of two numbers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' in the functions add() and subtract().",
  "sinks": "Return statements output the results of the calculations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the addition and subtraction operations, then results are returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The functions perform straightforward mathematical operations without any unusual code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple functions for addition and subtraction, with clear purpose and no external data sources, no suspicious or hidden code, and no external effects. No input validation or external calls are present, which is typical for such utility functions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing basic arithmetic operations with no malicious intent or security risks.",
