  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include dynamic functions (eval/exec), environment variables, network requests, input streams, and file operations.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows to network, file system, or environment variables, potentially leading to data leakage or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into dynamic execution functions or network communication points, with no explicit malicious sinks confirmed.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation indicated by minimal comments, unusual variable naming, and use of eval/exec; no hardcoded secrets or confirmed malicious functions observed.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits minimal obfuscation with potential dynamic execution, raising suspicion but lacking concrete evidence of malicious activity. The benign nature of other code snippets aligns with low malware and security risk scores. The suspicion in report 2 justifies a higher obfuscation score, but malware remains low due to absence of confirmed malicious functions. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is predominantly benign with some suspicion of obfuscation and dynamic execution. No confirmed malicious activity is present. The scores reflect a low security threat, with moderate suspicion in specific cases. The reports are internally consistent and accurate.",
