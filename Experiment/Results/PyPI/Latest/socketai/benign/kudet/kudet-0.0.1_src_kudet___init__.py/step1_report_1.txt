  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script performing some form of data processing or utility function, with no clear malicious intent evident from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, environment variables, or external modules. No explicit user input handling is observed in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to external modules, possibly written to files or network sockets, but no explicit untrusted sink such as network transmission or file write with untrusted data is apparent.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and outputs, but without suspicious transformations or data leaks seen.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior are evident. The code appears straightforward and typical of utility scripts.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis indicates the code is a typical Python script with standard library usage. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or privacy violations are detected. Usage of third-party libraries is conventional and not suspicious by itself. The code structure does not include any suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscated code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It seems to be a routine utility or data processing script without any supply chain or malware concerns.",
