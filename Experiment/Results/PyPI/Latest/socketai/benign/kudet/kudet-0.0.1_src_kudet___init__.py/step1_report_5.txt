  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script for data processing and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input is taken from user input or external files, if any; environment variables are not explicitly accessed.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that perform network communication, file manipulation, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (if any) through processing functions, but no risky flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual language features or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of straightforward functions performing data transformations. It does not invoke system commands, access network resources, or manipulate sensitive data. No malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors are present. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and not suspicious. No evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script with no indications of malware or malicious intent.",
