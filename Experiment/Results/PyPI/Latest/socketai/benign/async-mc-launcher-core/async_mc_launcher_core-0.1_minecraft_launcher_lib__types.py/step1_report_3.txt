  "purpose": "Define data structures and types for minecraft-launcher-lib, mainly for static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing', 'datetime', and 'uuid'. No user input or external data sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; this module solely contains type definitions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or executable logic; all are static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are detected; code appears to be standard type annotations and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises only type definitions using TypedDict and standard Python imports. It includes no functions, network calls, or data handling mechanisms. The uuid4 import is used solely for type annotation purposes in the Credential dict, but not for generating UUIDs at runtime within this module. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or potentially malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is purely for type annotations and data structure definitions related to a Minecraft launcher library. It does not contain executable code or data handling that could be exploited. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
