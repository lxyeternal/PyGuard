  "purpose": "Define data structures for minecraft-launcher-lib, including user options, version info, loader info, and other related configurations.",
  "sources": "Imported modules: typing (Literal, TypedDict, Callable), datetime, uuid4 from uuid",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows to critical operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines types and data schemas.",
  "anomalies": "Use of uuid4 in Credential TypedDict: uuid: uuid4 (a function call) is unconventional; should be uuid: str for data serialization compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of type definitions for various configurations and data models used in minecraft-launcher-lib. No runtime code, input handling, or external communications are present. The only notable point is the use of uuid4 directly within a TypedDict, which may cause issues but is not inherently malicious. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or malicious logic. Overall, the code serves as a static schema, with no malicious activity evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only data type definitions for configuration and informational purposes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. The use of uuid4 in the Credential type should be reviewed for correctness but does not pose security concerns.",
