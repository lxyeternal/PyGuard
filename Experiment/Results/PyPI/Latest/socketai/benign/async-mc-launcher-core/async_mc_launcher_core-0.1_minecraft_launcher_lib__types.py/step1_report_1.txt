  "purpose": "Define various typed data structures for the minecraft-launcher-lib project, including configuration options, version info, and media assets.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data sources directly; primarily type definitions and static data structures.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, no system calls, network operations, or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code is purely type declarations without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a 'uuid' field assigned 'uuid4' in the Credential TypedDict appears to be a default value rather than a runtime-generated UUID. No actual code uses this value, indicating potential misuse or confusion. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines TypedDict classes used for type hinting in the application. It imports standard libraries such as 'typing', 'datetime', and 'uuid', but does not execute any logic or perform data manipulation. The 'uuid' in Credential is statically set to 'uuid4', which is a class/function, not a value; this could be a mistake or misrepresentation. There are no functions, no data processing, and no runtime code execution. Overall, the code appears to be safe and purely declarative.",
  "conclusion": "This module consists entirely of data type definitions for configuration and media data related to a Minecraft launcher library. It contains no executable code, no external data input, and no suspicious logic. The only minor concern is the static assignment of 'uuid4' in Credential, which may be a mistake or placeholder, but does not pose security risks. Overall, the code is safe.",
