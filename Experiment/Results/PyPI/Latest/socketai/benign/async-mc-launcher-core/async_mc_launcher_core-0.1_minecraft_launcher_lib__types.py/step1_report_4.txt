  "purpose": "Define data structures for minecraft-launcher-lib, including configuration options, version info, and credentials.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or untrusted data directly; it mainly defines TypedDict classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing that handle untrusted data; no data leaks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code consists solely of type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The 'Credential' class contains a 'uuid' field set as 'uuid4', which appears to be a type reference, not an executed function call; it does not generate or store actual UUIDs or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of TypedDict class definitions for various data structures used in the minecraft-launcher-lib. There are no executable functions, data handling, or external interactions. The only potentially noteworthy element is the 'Credential' class, where 'uuid' is assigned 'uuid4' as a type annotation rather than a runtime UUID generator; this does not pose a security risk. No malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to serve static type annotations only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static type definitions for a Minecraft launcher library, with no executable logic or data handling that could be malicious. There are no signs of malware or security risks present.",
