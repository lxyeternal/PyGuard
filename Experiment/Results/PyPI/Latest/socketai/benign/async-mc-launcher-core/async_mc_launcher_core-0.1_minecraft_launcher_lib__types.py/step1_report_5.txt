  "purpose": "Define data structures for minecraft-launcher-lib, including types for configuration, version info, skins, news, and credentials.",
  "sources": "Imports (typing, datetime, uuid), class attribute definitions, and the uuid4 usage in Credential class.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the code only declares types and data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of uuid4 within Credential TypedDict. uuid4() is called during class definition, which is unusual and likely unintended, as it generates a new UUID each time the module is imported, not per instance. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type declarations using Python's TypedDict for structured data representations. The only dynamic code is 'uuid4' imported from uuid and used in the Credential class, which sets 'uuid' to uuid4. This means every time the module is loaded, the 'uuid' field in Credential would be assigned a new UUID. This is inconsistent with typical use where UUIDs are generated per instance, not at module load time. No other suspicious or malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type definitions with a potential misuse of uuid4 at the class level, which might lead to unintended UUID assignment. There are no signs of malware or malicious code, and no security risks are evident beyond the probable design oversight. The overall security risk is very low.",
