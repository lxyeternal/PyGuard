  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely type definitions with no executable logic. The only concern is the 'uuid' field in Credential being assigned 'uuid4', which is a class/function, not a value.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identified that the code is static data structures. The mention of 'uuid4' as a potential misuse is valid; it should probably be a string or generated at runtime, not assigned directly.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. The minor concern about 'uuid4' does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on 'uuid4' being used directly in the TypedDict, which is unconventional.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes that 'uuid4' is a function, and using it directly as a type or value in a TypedDict is questionable. It suggests it should be 'str' for serialization.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — perhaps slightly overestimating, but given the misuse, a low security concern is reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is accurate; no malicious activity, just a potential design oversight.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms that the code is only type definitions with no runtime logic. The use of 'uuid4' is not problematic in this context.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states that the code is safe and purely declarative.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing that the code is static type definitions. The 'uuid' field in Credential is not a UUID but a type annotation.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The mention that 'uuid' is assigned 'uuid4' as a type annotation rather than a runtime value is accurate.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Noted that 'uuid4' is used during class definition, which causes 'uuid' to be assigned a new UUID each time the module loads, which is likely unintended.\n- **Assessment:** This is a critical point. Using 'uuid4' directly in the TypedDict field means every import creates a new UUID, which is probably a mistake. However, this is a design flaw, not malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, as it’s more of a logical error than a security issue.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is correct; the main concern is the misuse of 'uuid4' leading to unintended behavior, but no malware or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations, but generally very low, reflecting that these are static type definitions with minor logical issues (misuse of 'uuid4').\n\n### **My Final Evaluation:**\n\n- The code is purely declarative type definitions with no executable or malicious code.\n- The only notable issue is the use of 'uuid4' in the Credential TypedDict, which causes a new UUID to be generated at module load time, not per instance. This is likely an oversight rather than malicious intent.\n- No external data sources, no code injection, no backdoors, no malware.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — due to the logical mistake with 'uuid4', but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with a minor logical issue regarding UUID generation. It does not pose any security threat or malware risk. The scores should reflect that.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1  \n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to provide a detailed justification for these final scores.",
