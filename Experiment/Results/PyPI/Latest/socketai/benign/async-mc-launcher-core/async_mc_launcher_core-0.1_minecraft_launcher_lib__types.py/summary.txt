  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static type definitions with a minor logical flaw in the 'uuid' field of Credential, which could cause unintended behavior but poses no security threat or malware risk. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity. The main issue is the misuse of 'uuid4' as a default value, which should be replaced with a proper runtime UUID generation. Overall, the code is safe, with negligible security risk."
