  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing Minecraft launcher files, including downloading, checksum validation, JSON parsing, ZIP extraction, and version management.",
  "sources": "Network requests (URLs), local files, environment variables, in-memory caches, system info via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "File writes, network responses, in-memory caches, system info retrieval, ZIP extraction.",
  "flows": "Data from URLs and files into cache, disk, or JSON objects; path validation ensures safe directory usage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious URL patterns; subprocess used only for benign system info.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries and practices for network, file, and system operations. Path validation via 'startswith' prevents directory traversal. Checksum verification ensures file integrity. Caching reduces redundant network requests. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Use of subprocess is limited to retrieving system version info on Windows, which is benign. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility library for a Minecraft launcher, with appropriate security measures and no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, legitimate, and free of malicious behavior. It employs standard security practices such as path validation and checksum verification. No signs of supply chain attacks, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
