  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for managing Minecraft launcher files, including downloading files, validating paths, parsing JSON rules, handling archives, and caching HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user-provided URLs, local file paths, environment info, and system info. Data is read from URLs, local files, ZIP archives, and system platform calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing files asynchronously, network responses (HTTP GET requests), and executing subprocess commands for system info on Windows. Files are written to disk, and network responses are stored or retrieved from cache.",
  "flows": "Data flows from network inputs (download, get requests) into file writes or JSON parsing. System info is retrieved via platform/system calls and used in rule evaluation. The data flows from network responses into cache storage and file system or into JSON structures for processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret keys detected. The code uses standard libraries and patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed. There is a caching mechanism for HTTP responses, which is normal. No backdoors or malware behaviors such as system damage, data theft, or reverse shells are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured for legitimate purposes: downloading files, validating paths, parsing JSON rules, managing cached network responses, and extracting ZIP files. The download function performs checksum validation, which is standard. Path validation ensures files stay within a designated directory, preventing directory traversal. The system info functions are standard platform calls, not suspicious. The use of aiohttp and aiofiles for async I/O is consistent with network and file operations. The cache for HTTP responses helps reduce network load and is implemented securely. No evidence of malicious intent, secret exfiltration, or harmful system commands. The subprocess call on Windows only retrieves system version info, a benign operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate helper library for managing Minecraft launcher files and updates. It implements standard patterns for network requests, file handling, and path validation. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage. Its design is consistent with safe, well-understood functionality for its purpose.",
