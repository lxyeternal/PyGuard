{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve, change, upload, and reset Minecraft skins and capes via Mojang's API, using user credentials and skin URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads user credentials (uuid, access_token), skin URLs, cape URLs, and local skin files.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Mojang API endpoints for profile info, skin updates, uploads, and resets; reads local files for skin uploads.",
  "flows": "Credential data flows into API request headers and payloads; skin URLs and files are sent to Mojang servers; responses determine success.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client interacting with Mojang's official endpoints for skin management. It handles credentials securely, performs standard HTTP requests, and processes data transparently. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The data flow is typical for such an API client, with credentials as sources and network requests as sinks. The decoding of base64-encoded properties and JSON parsing are standard procedures. The functions perform expected tasks without suspicious patterns or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured client for managing Minecraft skins and capes. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, reflecting minimal inherent risks associated with network and credential handling. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is 0, consistent with the code's clarity and purpose.",
