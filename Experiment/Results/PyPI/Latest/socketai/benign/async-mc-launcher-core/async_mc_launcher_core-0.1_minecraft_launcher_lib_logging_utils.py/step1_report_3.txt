  "sources": "Importing logging module and calling setup_logger from minecraft_launcher_lib.setting",
  "sinks": "Logging output directed to 'minecraft_launcher_lib.log' file",
  "flows": "Logging configuration is set up at import, but no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling is present",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors; the setup_logger function is a standard logging setup",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger using a utility function, likely configuring logging for the library. No user input, untrusted data, or external network interactions are present. The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard setup procedure. No malicious behavior or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logger setup with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply configures logging output to a file, which is standard practice.",
