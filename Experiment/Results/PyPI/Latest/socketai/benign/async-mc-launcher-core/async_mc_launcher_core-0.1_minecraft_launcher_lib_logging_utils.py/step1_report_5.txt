  "purpose": "Set up a global logger for the minecraft_launcher_lib module.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters for logger setup and imports the setup_logger function.",
  "sinks": "The logger outputs to a log file 'minecraft_launcher_lib.log'; no untrusted data or user input is processed.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters are passed to setup_logger, which initializes the logger; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code simply initializes a logger without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a logging setup function from a local module, then initializes a logger with a specified filename and console output disabled. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden behaviors. It appears to be a standard logging setup for application diagnostics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and only sets up logging for the application. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
