  "purpose": "Configure and initialize a logger for the minecraft_launcher_lib module.",
  "sources": "The code imports the setup_logger function from the minecraft_launcher_lib.setting module.",
  "sinks": "The logger writes logs to a file named 'minecraft_launcher_lib.log' and potentially to the console if enabled.",
  "flows": "Logger configuration takes static parameters; no untrusted data sources are involved, and logging output is directed to a file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears straightforward and typical for logger setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a logger setup function and initializes a global logger with a specific name, log level, and output file. No dynamic or user input data is processed. The setup is standard and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard logger configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for application logging purposes.",
