  "review": "Let's carefully review the provided reports and the original code to assess their accuracy and consistency.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward logger setup:\n     ```python\n     import logging\n     from minecraft_launcher_lib.setting import setup_logger\n\n     # Initialize global logger\n     logger = setup_logger(\n         name=\"minecraft_launcher_lib\",\n         level=logging.INFO,\n         filename=\"minecraft_launcher_lib.log\",\n         enable_console=False,\n     )\n     ```\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or insecure practices. The code only configures logging with static parameters, no dynamic or untrusted input involved.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly describe the code as a standard, benign logger setup.\n   - They mention no hardcoded credentials, malicious behaviors, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified because the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are highly consistent and accurate.\n   - No report suggests any reason to increase the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting certainty in their assessments.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the `setup_logger` function is imported from `minecraft_launcher_lib.setting`, it would be prudent to review that function's implementation separately to ensure it doesn't introduce hidden behaviors. However, based on the current reports, the setup appears standard.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here, given the evidence.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent with the code.** There are no signs of malicious or risky behavior. The code is a typical logger setup, and the scores reflect that.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No modifications needed to the scores.\n- The confidence in the assessment is high.\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0",
