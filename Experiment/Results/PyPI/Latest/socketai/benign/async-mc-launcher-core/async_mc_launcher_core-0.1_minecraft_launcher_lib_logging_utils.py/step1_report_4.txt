  "purpose": "Set up a global logger for the minecraft_launcher_lib module",
  "sources": "import statement for setup_logger from minecraft_launcher_lib.setting",
  "sinks": "logger object creation and configuration; logging outputs to a file",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources, so no source-to-sink data flows",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports a setup_logger function from a module, then initializes a logger with specific parameters including a filename for logging output and disabling console logging. There are no hardcoded credentials, no code injection, or suspicious operations. The code is standard for logging setup and does not exhibit obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logger setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply configures logging for the module and directs logs to a file. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
