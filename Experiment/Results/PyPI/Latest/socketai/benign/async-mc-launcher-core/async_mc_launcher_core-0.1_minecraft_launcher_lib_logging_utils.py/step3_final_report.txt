  "purpose": "Configure a global logger for the minecraft_launcher_lib module using a custom setup function.",
  "sources": "Import from minecraft_launcher_lib.setting; static parameters in setup_logger call",
  "sinks": "Logging output directed to 'minecraft_launcher_lib.log' file",
  "flows": "Static parameters used in setup_logger; no untrusted data or dynamic input involved",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a setup_logger function and initializes a logger with fixed parameters, including a filename and console output disabled. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard logging practices, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Multiple reviews confirm the benign nature, with consistent scoring and reasoning. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, justified by the simplicity and safety of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign logger setup with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly assess it as safe, with appropriate zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk. No modifications are necessary.",
