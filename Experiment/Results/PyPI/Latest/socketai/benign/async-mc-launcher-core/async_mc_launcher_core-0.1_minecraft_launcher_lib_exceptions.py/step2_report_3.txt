  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Explains that the code defines custom exception classes for error handling in minecraft-launcher-lib.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: The code reads parameters and constructs exception objects; no untrusted data processing or external actions.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code.  \n- Analysis: The code is straightforward class definitions with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Benign, standard exception classes.  \n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0, Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that the code is for error handling, with no data processing or external communication.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, standard exception definitions.  \n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0, Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Same as above, highlighting that the code only defines exception classes with no I/O or data handling.  \n- No signs of malicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, straightforward code.  \n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0, Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Reiterates that the code only defines exception classes, no data processing or external effects.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior detected.  \n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0, Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Similar findings: exception class definitions, no data flow from untrusted sources, no external actions.  \n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, standard code.  \n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0, Confidence: 1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is purely class definitions for exceptions, with no logic that could be malicious or insecure.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident.  \n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Risk justification:** Since no malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present, the scores are justified.  \n- **Assumptions:** The reports correctly assume that exception class definitions are benign, which is accurate.  \n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent across reports.\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\n**The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for error handling within a Minecraft launcher library. There is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk present.**\n\n**Estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, as a precaution, but effectively none)  \n\n**Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.**",
