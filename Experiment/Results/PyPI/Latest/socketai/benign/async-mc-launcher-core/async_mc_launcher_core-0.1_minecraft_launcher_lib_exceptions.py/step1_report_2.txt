{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes used for error handling within the minecraft-launcher-lib project, primarily related to version management, security, account status, and external program execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data mainly through constructor parameters for setting exception details, such as version strings, command outputs, file paths, and error codes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects. It only raises exceptions with descriptive messages.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely constructs exception objects based on provided parameters without processing untrusted input in a risky manner.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code adheres to standard exception class definitions with no hidden or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of multiple custom exception classes designed for specific error scenarios within the minecraft-launcher-lib. All classes follow standard Python practices for defining exceptions. There is no evidence of malicious intent, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The data used in exceptions is limited to parameters passed during instantiation, with no handling of untrusted input or network communication. The code appears to be well-structured, purpose-specific, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of custom exception definitions for error handling in a Minecraft launcher library. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no anomalies or obfuscated elements, and poses no threat in its current form.",
