{
  "purpose": "This code defines various custom exception classes used within the minecraft-launcher-lib project, primarily for error handling and specific security or operational issues.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from parameters passed to exception constructors, including strings, lists, and custom objects like VanillaLauncherProfile.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages are constructed and could potentially include sensitive information if the inputs are untrusted, but the code itself does not handle untrusted data directly or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., version strings, command lists, file paths, checksums) into exception objects, which then may be raised to signal errors. No untrusted data is processed or executed within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains straightforward exception class definitions with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The exception messages are standard and do not reveal sensitive data. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines custom exception classes related to version management, security, account status, and external program execution within the context of a Minecraft launcher library. All data handling is limited to storing passed parameters and constructing error messages. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code injection. The code is well-structured and follows typical Python exception handling patterns without any anomalies or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This source code solely provides exception class definitions for error handling in a Minecraft launcher library. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign module for managing error conditions.",
