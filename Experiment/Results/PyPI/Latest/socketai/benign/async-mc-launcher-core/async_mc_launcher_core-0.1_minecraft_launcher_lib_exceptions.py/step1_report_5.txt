{
  "purpose": "This code defines various custom exception classes used in the minecraft-launcher-lib, primarily for handling errors related to version management, security, account issues, and external program execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from parameters passed to exception constructors, such as version strings, command output bytes, file paths, URLs, and profiles.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes data to external systems, network, or files. It merely raises exceptions with data attributes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (like version strings, command outputs, URLs, paths) into exception objects, but these flows do not involve untrusted data execution or external effects within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings. No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated sections are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines custom exception classes used for error handling within the library. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modifications. Inputs are typically parameters related to errors or state information, and outputs are exception objects. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code follows typical Python exception patterns and is focused solely on error representation.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard exception class definitions for error handling in a Minecraft launcher library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears safe and normal for its intended purpose.",
