  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines custom exceptions for error handling, with parameters like version strings and profiles.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data is processed insecurely; messages are constructed from parameters.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely exception class definitions with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.  \n**Assessment:** Fully benign, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on error handling with no dynamic code or untrusted data processing.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.  \n**Assessment:** Also benign, standard exception classes.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Same pattern: exception classes, no input processing or external effects.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.  \n**Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Consistent with previous: exception definitions, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.  \n**Assessment:** Safe and standard.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Similar conclusion: no data processing issues, no malicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.  \n**Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe straightforward exception class definitions.  \n- **Potential Risks:** No evidence of data leaks, code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, consistent with the benign nature.  \n- **Security Risk:** None identified.  \n- **Confidence:** High, as all reports agree on the benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current scores (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0) are appropriate and justified.  \n- Given the nature of the code, increasing the malware score is unwarranted.  \n- The overall assessment aligns with the evidence: this code is a standard, safe set of exception definitions.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.",
