{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling various error conditions in a Minecraft launcher library, including security, account, and platform-related errors.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input; it primarily defines exception classes and constructors with parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code performs actions that process untrusted data in a security-sensitive manner; it only initializes exceptions with parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident, as the code only sets attributes and raises exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The exception classes are straightforward and do not execute external commands or handle untrusted data.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for various error scenarios within a Minecraft launcher context. It does not include any code execution, data transmission, or data processing that could be malicious. The constructors accept parameters relevant to the exceptions, such as version strings, command outputs, file paths, etc., but do not process or transmit data insecurely. No indicators of backdoors, malware, or security breaches are detected. The code adheres to standard practices for exception handling without suspicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception classes related to error handling in a Minecraft launcher library. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code is well-structured and conventional, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
