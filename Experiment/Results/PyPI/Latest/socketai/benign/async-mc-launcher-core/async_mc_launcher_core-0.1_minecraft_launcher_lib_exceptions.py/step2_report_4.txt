  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines custom exceptions; sources are constructor parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data is processed insecurely; exception messages are constructed from parameters.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1 (confident, as it’s a benign, well-structured module).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard exception classes.\n- No data leaks, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: exception classes without dynamic code or external effects.\n- No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, straightforward exception class definitions.\n- No processing of untrusted data, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous findings; exception classes only.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code Presence:** All reports confirm that the code only contains exception class definitions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Security Risks:** No security risks are present; the code is purely for error handling.\n- **Scores Justification:** Given the benign nature, a risk score of 1 seems high. Typically, such exception definitions should be rated very low risk (e.g., 0.0 or 0.1). The malware score is correctly zero, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be very low, e.g., 0.0 or 0.1, reflecting that this is standard exception handling code with no security concerns.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThis code is a set of standard, well-structured exception class definitions for error handling in a Minecraft launcher library. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The current high risk score (1) is unjustified; I recommend lowering it to 0.0 or 0.1.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal, non-security-related code, but still acknowledging it's error handling code)\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to adjust the scores further or provide additional insights.",
