{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for the minecraft-launcher-lib, mainly for error handling related to version management, security, account status, and platform support.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input directly; it defines exception classes used elsewhere in the application.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains data output or handling of untrusted data; it only raises exceptions with string messages.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as the code only defines exception classes without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions with descriptive messages.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only custom exception class definitions used for handling various errors such as version issues, security violations, account problems, and platform support. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted data. All messages are static and descriptive. The code appears standard and straightforward for error handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling within a Python library. It poses no security threats or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is negligible, and there is no indication of malware or malicious activity.",
