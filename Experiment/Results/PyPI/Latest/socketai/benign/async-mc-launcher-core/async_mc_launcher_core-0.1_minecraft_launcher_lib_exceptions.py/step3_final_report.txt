  "purpose": "Defines a set of custom exception classes for error handling within the minecraft-launcher-lib, including version errors, security issues, account problems, and external program failures.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters such as version strings, command output bytes, file paths, URLs, and profile objects.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages and attributes are assigned from parameters; no data is transmitted externally or processed insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into exception object attributes and messages; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. The code consists solely of class definitions with static messages.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises straightforward exception class definitions used for error handling. There is no dynamic code execution, no processing of untrusted data, no network communication, and no obfuscation. All parameters are used solely for constructing exception messages or storing error details. The code is well-structured, standard, and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception classes for error handling in a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks. The scores are consistent with the code's nature, and no adjustments are necessary.",
