{
  "purpose": "This module appears to organize and expose various components of a Minecraft launcher library for use in other parts of the project.",
  "sources": "The code reads static module imports and a logger utility, with no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as this code only imports modules and sets an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. All imports are standard and static; no dynamic code execution or hardcoded secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as an initialization or configuration script, importing various modules and defining an export list. It does not perform data processing, input/output, or network communication. The only imported element is a logger, which is standard practice. The structure is straightforward and lacks any unusual or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions solely as an import and export declaration without any suspicious activity.",
