{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or aggregator for the minecraft-launcher-lib, importing various internal modules and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Static import statements of internal modules and a logger utility.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static imports do not involve data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static module setup with no dynamic execution, input handling, or network activity. It only imports internal components and defines __all__, typical for a package initializer. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's purpose is purely organizational, and the import statements are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
