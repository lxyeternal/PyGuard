  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation: it performs asynchronous HTTP GET requests to known Mojang URLs, parses JSON responses, processes date fields, and returns the data.\n- No user input is involved beyond the API calls, and responses are returned as-is after parsing.\n- The code uses standard libraries (`aiohttp`, `datetime`) and a helper function for the user-agent.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, with malware scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The only potential concern is the \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1, which is very low and possibly conservative, but not unreasonable given the code's external network activity.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the reports' reasoning or summaries.\n- The reports correctly identify the code's purpose, sources, data flow, and benign nature.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **SecurityRisk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2; given the code's benign nature, these are reasonable. A very conservative approach might assign 0.1, which is acceptable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- No issues are present that warrant a higher risk score.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious operations, nor does it handle untrusted input in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n\n- The reports' confidence levels are mostly 1, with one at 0.9, which is reasonable.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are low, aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal external network activity, no vulnerabilities)  \n\nThese scores reflect the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, safe implementation for fetching public data from Mojang's APIs. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nIf I were to assign my own scores, I would agree with the existing ones:  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
