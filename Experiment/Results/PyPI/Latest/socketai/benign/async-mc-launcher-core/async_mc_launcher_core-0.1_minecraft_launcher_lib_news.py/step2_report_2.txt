  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\n- The code performs straightforward asynchronous HTTP GET requests to Mojang's official URLs, parses JSON responses, and processes date fields.\n- The user-agent is set via a helper function, which is standard practice.\n- Responses are returned as parsed JSON objects without further processing or data leakage.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- No input from untrusted sources beyond the API calls, and responses are handled securely.\n\n**Malware and Security Risk Assessment:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk score is consistently low (around 0.1), which seems reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Potential Flaws or Concerns:**\n\n- No actual vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n- The only minor point is that the responses are returned as-is; if the data were logged or processed insecurely elsewhere, that could pose a risk, but within this snippet, it’s safe.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n\n- The reports assign a `malware` score of 0 and a `securityRisk` of 0.1, which seems appropriate.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is legitimate, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk≈0.1, obfuscated=0) are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, reflecting the benign nature but acknowledging external dependencies and network calls.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is safe, legitimate, and free of malware.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action required.",
