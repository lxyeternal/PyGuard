  "purpose": "Retrieve news and patch notes about Minecraft from Mojang's official API.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests to 'https://launchercontent.mojang.com/news.json' and 'https://launchercontent.mojang.com/javaPatchNotes.json'.",
  "sinks": "The response JSON data is parsed and returned; no data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "HTTP requests (sources) lead to parsing JSON responses, which are then processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of standard libraries and APIs. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code makes asynchronous HTTP GET requests to fetch JSON data from Mojang's official URLs, processes date fields in the news entries, and returns structured data. Usage of 'aiohttp' is appropriate for asynchronous network I/O. Headers include a user-agent obtained from a helper function, which is typical. No suspicious or malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard API consumption practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for fetching and processing news data from Mojang's API. No malicious intent or security risks are detected. It appears safe and legitimate.",
