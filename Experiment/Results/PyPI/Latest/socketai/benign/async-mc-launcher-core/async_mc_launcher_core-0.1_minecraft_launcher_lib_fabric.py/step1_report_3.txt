{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to interact with the Fabric modloader for Minecraft, including retrieving versions and installing Fabric.",
  "sources": "HTTP requests to FabricMC URLs, environment variables, input parameters such as versions and directories, subprocess execution commands.",
  "sinks": "Downloading files from external URLs, executing Java subprocesses for installation, reading environment variables or input parameters, creating temporary directories.",
  "flows": "HTTP response data flows from network requests to functions, input parameters flow into validation and subprocess commands, downloaded files flow into subprocess execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual or obfuscated code; standard use of asynchronous HTTP requests, subprocess calls, and temporary directories. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or hidden malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles version fetching, validation, and executing external Java processes to install Fabric modloader. It uses standard libraries and well-known patterns. External URLs are used for fetching version metadata and installers, but these are official FabricMC sources. Subprocess commands invoke Java with dynamically provided arguments; however, these are based on user input and standard installation procedures. No suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious behavior is detected. The code does not collect or leak sensitive information, nor does it contain hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a Fabric modloader installer with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses external URLs to fetch data and executes external processes, which is expected for such functionality. No indicators of malware or supply chain attacks are present.",
