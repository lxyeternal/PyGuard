{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for managing Fabric modloader versions, downloading and installing Fabric, and checking version support for Minecraft and Fabric.",
  "sources": "External URLs for Fabric version metadata and installer files, user-provided paths and version strings, environment variables for Java executable",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution for running Java installer, downloading files from URLs, and filesystem operations for saving downloads and installations",
  "flows": "URL fetch functions retrieve version info; download_file downloads installer JAR; subprocess executes Java installer; install_minecraft_version manages game files",
  "anomalies": "Use of tempfile.TemporaryDirectory for installer download and execution; subprocess call with dynamically constructed command; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; no suspicious URL domains besides known Fabric URLs",
  "analysis": "The code mainly interacts with external URLs to fetch version metadata and download installers, uses subprocess to run Java with downloaded installer JAR, and manages game files. All URLs are from official Fabric domains. The subprocess execution dynamically constructs commands based on user input or defaults, which is standard for installer scripts. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic code execution present. The download and subprocess steps are typical for installer routines. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate installer management script for the Fabric modloader, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It interacts with known Fabric URLs, performs expected operations for downloading and executing an installer, and manages Minecraft versions securely. No indicators of malware or malicious behavior are present.",
