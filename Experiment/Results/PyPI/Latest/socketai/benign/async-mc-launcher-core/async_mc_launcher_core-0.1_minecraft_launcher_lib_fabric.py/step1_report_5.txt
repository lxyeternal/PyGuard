{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for managing Fabric modloader versions, installing Fabric, and interacting with Minecraft versions supported by Fabric.",
  "sources": "HTTP requests to Fabric's metadata endpoints, reading environment variables, user-provided parameters, temporary file creation, and subprocess execution.",
  "sinks": "Downloading files from external URLs, executing Java commands via subprocess, and installing dependencies based on remote data.",
  "flows": "HTTP response data from URLs flows into parsing and version selection; downloaded files flow from remote to local temporary directories; subprocess commands execute Java with downloaded installer JAR.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard libraries and clear API calls. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic code execution or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves version data via HTTP requests, downloads an installer JAR, and executes Java processes for installation. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors observed. Functions handle standard version management and installation workflows. The subprocess execution uses dynamic parameters but in a typical and expected manner for software installation. No evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks is detected. The process relies on external trusted sources and standard system calls, with no apparent manipulations or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and well-structured implementation for managing Fabric Minecraft modloader versions, with no indications of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities based on the provided content.",
