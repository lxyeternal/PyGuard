  "purpose": "Manage Fabric versions, fetch version data, download installer JARs, and execute Java processes for installation.",
  "sources": "HTTP requests to official Fabric URLs, reading version data, downloading installer files, user-supplied parameters for subprocess execution.",
  "sinks": "Downloading files from trusted URLs, executing Java subprocesses with user-controlled arguments, installing Fabric and loader versions.",
  "flows": "Fetch version data from URLs -> download installer JARs -> run Java commands with parameters -> install Fabric components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected. Use of temporary directories and subprocess calls are standard. Parameters are validated and sourced from official URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts solely with official Fabric URLs, performs version validation, downloads installer files, and executes Java commands for installation. Subprocess calls are parameterized and include validation, reducing risk. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is justified as 0, and the low security risk score (~0.2) reflects the minimal inherent risk of executing external processes with user inputs, which are validated. The code structure and behavior align with standard installer routines, and no suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
