  "purpose": "Provides functions for managing Fabric modloader versions, installation, and compatibility checks for Minecraft.",
  "sources": "HTTP requests to Fabric's meta endpoints, Maven metadata URL, environment variables for Java path, and user-supplied parameters.",
  "sinks": "Downloading files from external URLs, executing Java processes, and installing Minecraft versions.",
  "flows": "Fetching version data from Fabric's URLs and Maven, then downloading installer files, followed by executing Java commands for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious hardcoded secrets observed. Use of temporary directories for installer files is standard. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution found.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles version data fetching from official URLs, performs version validation, and installs Fabric using subprocess execution with proper parameterization. No data leaks, credential theft, or suspicious network activity detected. The subprocess execution for Java is standard for installer running, with error handling in place. No obfuscated or malicious logic identified. Code uses standard libraries and external URLs for version data, with no suspicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate library for managing Fabric modloader versions with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It securely downloads files, runs installer commands, and performs version checks as expected for its functionality.",
