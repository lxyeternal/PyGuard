{
  "purpose": "The code manages the installation of Minecraft modpacks from .mrpack files, including downloading files, extracting overrides, and installing dependencies such as Forge, Fabric, and Quilt.",
  "sources": "File reads from the zip archive (modrinth.index.json, override files), network requests via aiohttp to check forge versions, and user-provided file paths.",
  "sinks": "File writes for override extraction, network requests to forge URLs, and data loading from zip files. Potential data leaks or malicious activity could occur if untrusted data influences network requests or file paths.",
  "flows": "Zip file data is read from user-supplied paths; JSON data is parsed; file data is downloaded and written to user-specified directories; network requests check for forge versions; dependency installation flows from JSON data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. The code includes network requests to verify forge versions, but these are legitimate for dependency checking. There is extensive file and path handling, but no obvious signs of malicious obfuscation or hidden code. The code appears standard for modpack management.",
  "analysis": "The script handles reading from a zip archive, extracting JSON metadata, downloading files, and installing dependencies. It performs network requests to verify forge versions and writes files based on extracted archive data. Path checks are performed to prevent files from escaping the Minecraft directory. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are present. The network activity is limited to version verification, not exfiltration. The overall structure aligns with legitimate functionality for modpack management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate component for managing Minecraft modpacks. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are detected. Network requests and file operations are consistent with the intended purpose. There is no indication of malware or malicious intent, and the security risk score is low.",
