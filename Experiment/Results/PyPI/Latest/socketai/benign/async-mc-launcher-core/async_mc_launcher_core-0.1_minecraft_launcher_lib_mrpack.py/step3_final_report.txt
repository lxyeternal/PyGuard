{
  "purpose": "The code manages the installation of Minecraft modpacks in the Mrpack format, handling extraction, dependency validation, and dependency installation.",
  "sources": "Zip file entries ('modrinth.index.json', override files), network requests for forge version validation, file system operations for extraction and validation.",
  "sinks": "Writing files to disk (overrides, dependencies), HTTP HEAD requests for forge version check.",
  "flows": "Zip extraction -> dependency validation -> network checks -> file downloads -> file extraction -> dependency installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Network requests are standard version checks. Path validation mitigates directory traversal.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard modpack installation tasks: reading zip metadata, downloading files, extracting overrides, and installing dependencies. Network requests are used solely for forge version validation via straightforward URL formation. Path validation ensures files stay within the Minecraft directory. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is evident. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is justified by the network validation, which is typical in such tools. The malware score is 0, as no malicious intent or code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Minecraft modpack installer with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
