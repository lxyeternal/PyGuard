{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to facilitate the installation of Minecraft modpacks in the MRPack format by extracting files, downloading necessary dependencies, and handling various loader installations.",
  "sources": "Data sources include: reading from zip files (.mrpack), accessing URLs for forge version validation via HTTP HEAD requests, and reading configuration JSON files within the zip archive.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include: writing files to the filesystem (extraction and download), making HTTP requests (forge version validation), and calling installation functions for Minecraft and loaders.",
  "flows": "Data flows from zip file extraction (sources) to file writes, network requests for version validation, and subsequent calls to install Minecraft, forge, fabric, or quilt (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "The code performs URL HEAD requests to verify forge versions, which is common but could be misused if URLs are manipulated. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected. No unusual code behavior or hidden backdoors identified. No evidence of malicious privacy violations, credential theft, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles extracting files from a zip archive, downloading files, and installing dependencies for Minecraft modpacks. It uses standard libraries (zipfile, json, os) and popular third-party libraries (aiohttp, aiofiles) appropriately. The network request to verify forge versions is legitimate for dependency validation and does not reveal sensitive information. File extraction and download procedures include path checks to prevent directory traversal outside the Minecraft directory. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious URLs are detected. The code appears well-structured, with no obfuscated elements or hidden malicious logic. All operations align with expected behavior for a modpack installer.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code functions as a legitimate modpack installer, performing file extraction, dependency validation, and component installation. It employs standard practices for security, such as path validation and URL checks. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident. The code appears safe and intentionally designed for its purpose.",
