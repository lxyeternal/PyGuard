  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'spatial-ds-wrapper' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Reads from the filesystem ('README.md') during package setup; no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without validation is standard in setup scripts; no secrets or hardcoded credentials found; no suspicious code or behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads a local README file for the long description, which is standard practice. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden activities are present. The code aligns with common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
