  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file via open('README.md').read()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; static configuration only",
  "flows": "Reading local file 'README.md' into long_description variable; no data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and follows common packaging patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a local README file for description, specifies dependencies, and includes standard metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The use of open() to read 'README.md' is standard practice and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. All dependencies are common scientific packages. The code is static and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious code. All signals indicate a safe configuration with no security risks.",
