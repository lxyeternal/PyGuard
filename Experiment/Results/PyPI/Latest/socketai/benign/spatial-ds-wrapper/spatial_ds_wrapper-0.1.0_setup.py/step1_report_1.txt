{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'spatial-ds-wrapper', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package description from 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or untrusted data effects; no untrusted data handling or external connections are present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content is a static operation; dependencies are listed for installation but no data flows or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The open('README.md').read() pattern is common in setup scripts; no suspicious or unusual code is present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project. It reads package metadata, specifies dependencies, and sets package classifiers. There are no code execution, network activities, or data manipulations that could be malicious. All functions and operations are typical for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It primarily reads a markdown file for long description and specifies dependencies for package installation.",
