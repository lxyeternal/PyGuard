  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- The code reads 'README.md' via open(), which is common practice.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources is reported.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is a typical setup configuration script; no issues are present in the code itself.\n- The use of `open('README.md').read()` is standard and not suspicious.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious code, or security flaws are evident.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; they correctly identify the script as benign.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n- The assessments correctly assign a malware score of 0 and a risk score of 0.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware: 0`\n  - `obfuscated: 0`\n  - `securityRisk: 0`\n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected, scores should remain at 0.\n- The risk score is also correctly set to 0.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:\n- The only minor concern could be reading 'README.md' without validation, but this is standard practice and not a vulnerability.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a straightforward, benign setup script with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the existing scores. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security threat and is a standard packaging script.",
