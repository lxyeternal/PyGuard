  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'spatial-ds-wrapper' for spatial data science workflows.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data can lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> Package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without any validation or sanitization is typical in setup scripts and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies. It reads a README file for long description, which is common practice. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, untrusted input handling, or malicious code. The dependencies listed are standard scientific packages. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The script contains no network activity or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate configuration file for packaging Python code.",
