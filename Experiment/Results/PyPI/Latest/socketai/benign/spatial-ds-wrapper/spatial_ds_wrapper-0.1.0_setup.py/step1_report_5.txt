  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'spatial-ds-wrapper', facilitating its installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from the script itself and from 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the static metadata and 'README.md' content into the setup configuration, with no external data input or output beyond reading the README file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code uses standard setup tools.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' modules and calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration options. It reads the long description from a local file 'README.md'. The dependencies are standard scientific Python packages and there are no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The structure and functions used are typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It merely configures package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
