{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'spatial-ds-wrapper', specifying its metadata, dependencies, and packaging details.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package description from 'README.md' via open('README.md').read().",
  "sinks": "The read operation on 'README.md' file could potentially be exploited if the file contents are maliciously manipulated; however, this is a benign and standard practice.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' -> read() operation; package metadata and dependencies are set via static strings and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard setup() patterns without suspicious or unusual code structures. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, utilizing setuptools. It reads package description content from a markdown file, specifies dependencies and metadata, and calls setup() accordingly. There are no dynamic or unsafe operations, no external data flows beyond reading a static file, and no suspicious code patterns or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or malicious data handling. It is safe and standard for Python package distribution.",
