  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'yx-weather', defining metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description, specifying dependencies 'mcp' and 'httpx'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network connections, code execution, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reading static file 'README.md' to assign long_description; dependencies are statically declared; no dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with static reads and dependency declarations. No dynamic execution, user input, or external data processing occurs. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The dependencies are common packages, and the code does not perform any network activity or data leaks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
