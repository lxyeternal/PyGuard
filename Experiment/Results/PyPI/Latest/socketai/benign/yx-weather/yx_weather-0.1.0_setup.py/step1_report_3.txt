{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for publishing a Python package named 'yx-weather' that retrieves real-time weather data via the Amap API.",
  "sources": "Input sources include 'README.md' file read for long_description; dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no network or external data handling within this setup script.",
  "flows": "The setup process reads package metadata and dependencies, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without error handling is typical; no suspicious code or hardcoded credentials are present. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, no input validation, no network calls or credential handling within this code. The dependencies listed ('mcp' and 'httpx') are standard Python packages. The reading of 'README.md' is a common practice. All code appears straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It functions solely to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
