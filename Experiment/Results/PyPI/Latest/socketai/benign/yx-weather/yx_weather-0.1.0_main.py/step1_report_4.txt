  "purpose": "The code imports a function to print local weather-related time and executes it in the main function.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'print_local_time' from 'yx_weather.weather'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted outside the scope",
  "flows": "The source is the imported 'print_local_time' function; it is called within main() to output local time information",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function and calls it in main(). There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities. The imported function's behavior is unknown, but from this code alone, it appears to be a benign utility for printing local time, likely related to weather information. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or external network activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign script that imports and executes a weather-related function. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided code.",
