  "purpose": "To invoke the function print_local_time from the yx_weather.weather module, likely to display or log the current local time.",
  "sources": "Import statement from yx_weather.weather and the call to print_local_time() in main()",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations",
  "flows": "Import yx_weather.weather -> call print_local_time()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and function call with no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from an external module and calls it within main(). No input processing, data leaks, or network activity are present. The external function's internal behavior is unknown, but the code itself is simple and benign. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with this assessment, assuming the external function is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The external function's internal implementation could alter this assessment, but based on the provided snippet and reports, the code is safe.",
