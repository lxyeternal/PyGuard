{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to fetch and display weather information for a specified city using the AMap API, and initialize a FastMCP server for communication.",
  "sources": "Reads API key from a hardcoded constant, reads city input parameter in get_weather function, makes HTTP requests to external weather API",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET request to external weather API, prints error messages to console, outputs formatted weather data",
  "flows": "API key and city parameter (source) are used in HTTP request (sink); HTTP response is processed and formatted for output",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded API key, no obvious obfuscation, no hidden code, no dynamic execution, or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for date/time and typing, and uses httpx for HTTP requests. It defines functions to fetch weather data from AMap API using a hardcoded API key, formats and prints weather info, and runs a server. No obfuscation, no code injection, or hidden behaviors are present. External API communication is legitimate, and error handling is standard. The API key is hardcoded, which could be a security concern, but not malicious per se. The overall structure is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate weather fetching application with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The presence of a hardcoded API key could pose security risks if exposed, but it does not indicate malicious intent or sabotage. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected.",
