  "purpose": "This script fetches and formats weather data from the AMap API for specified cities and sets up a server using FastMCP.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'city' parameter for weather data; external data is fetched via HTTP request to AMap API.",
  "sinks": "External HTTP request to the API; output is printed or returned as a weather report string.",
  "flows": "Input 'city' parameter flows into the API request, which is sent over the network; response data is processed and formatted for output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; the API key is hardcoded but appears to be a legitimate API key; no obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a weather data retrieval system with proper API request handling, including error catching. It uses async HTTP requests to communicate with a trusted external API and formats the data for display. No indications of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code are present. The API key is embedded but appears to be a typical API key; no hardcoded credentials for sensitive operations or system access. The server setup is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate weather data retrieval and server initialization without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No malware indicators or security risks are detected.",
