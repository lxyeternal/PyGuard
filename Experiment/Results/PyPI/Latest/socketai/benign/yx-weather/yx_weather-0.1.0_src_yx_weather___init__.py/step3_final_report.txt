  "purpose": "A simple script importing an external weather module and printing a greeting and local time.",
  "sources": "Import statement from yx_weather.weather, function call print_local_time()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "Import -> print_local_time() (external module) -> output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns; reliance on external module noted but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing basic print operations and calling an external weather module. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The external module 'yx_weather.weather' could pose trust issues if malicious, but from this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The code does not handle untrusted input, perform network activity, or access sensitive data. The comments suggest debugging, which is benign. Overall, the code is benign with a very low security risk primarily related to external dependency trust.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. The external dependency 'yx_weather' is the only potential concern but cannot be assessed here. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), primarily due to dependency trust considerations.",
