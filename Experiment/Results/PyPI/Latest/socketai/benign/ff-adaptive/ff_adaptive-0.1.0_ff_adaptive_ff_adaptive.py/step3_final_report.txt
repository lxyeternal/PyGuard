{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom transformer class 'FFAdaptive' for an IR pipeline that appends neighbor document IDs from a 'CorpusGraph' to a DataFrame and applies a retriever transformation.",
  "sources": "DataFrame input 'df', 'corpus_graph.neighbours' method, 'retriever.transform' method",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; data manipulation is internal",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> drop columns -> apply neighbor expansion via 'corpus_graph.neighbours' -> explode list -> apply 'retriever.transform' -> output DataFrame",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward pandas operations; no obfuscation or external system calls",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing within an IR pipeline, appending neighbor document IDs and applying a retriever. No network, file, or malicious activity is present. The use of external objects ('corpus_graph', 'retriever') is typical, and their methods are assumed benign. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The logic is correct, and the code structure is clear. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified given the benign nature of operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign component of an IR pipeline with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
