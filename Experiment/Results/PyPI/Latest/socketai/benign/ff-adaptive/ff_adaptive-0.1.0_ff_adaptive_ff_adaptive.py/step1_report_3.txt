{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom transformer class for adaptive retrieval using a corpus graph and retriever, extending pyterrier functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports pandas, pyterrier, and a custom CorpusGraph class; data is read from input DataFrames and the corpus graph.",
  "sinks": "Transform method applies the retriever and data manipulations, but no dangerous sinks like network, file, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> _append_neighbours method modifies 'docid' column -> retriever.transform is applied -> final DataFrame returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; no unusual API calls or code that appears malicious or hidden.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data transformation and retrieval tasks within a machine learning pipeline. It manipulates DataFrames, integrates a corpus graph, and applies a retriever. All operations are standard for such a context; there are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, file system access, or backdoors. The code appears structured for purpose without any obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom transformer for retrieval-based NLP tasks. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks in this fragment.",
