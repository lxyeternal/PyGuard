  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippets carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports describe a single import statement:\n```python\nfrom .ff_adaptive import FFAdaptive\n```\nThis is a standard relative import in Python, importing a class from a local module. The code is minimal, with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Suspicious Patterns**  \n- None of the reports identify any anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.\n- The import statement is straightforward and typical in modular Python projects.\n- No evidence of data flow from untrusted sources, no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code execution.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate: they correctly identify the code as a benign import statement.\n- The reasoning is sound: no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Justification**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 or 0.1 — appropriate, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 or very close to 0 — justified, since the code is benign.\n- **Data Flow and Source/Sink Analysis:** No issues, as expected.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Risk or Malware**  \n- Given the code snippet and reports, there is no basis for assigning a higher malware or risk score.\n- The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features strongly suggest a safe, standard import.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**  \n- The code is a typical import statement, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**  \n- **Malware Score:** Remain at 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Remain at 0 or 0.1  \n- **Risk Score:** 0, as there's no security concern\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code snippet is benign, standard, and poses no security risk. The reports correctly identify it as such, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustment is needed.",
