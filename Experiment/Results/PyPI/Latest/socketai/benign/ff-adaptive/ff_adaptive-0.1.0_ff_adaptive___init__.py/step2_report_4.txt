  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the issues in the code:**\n   - All reports describe a simple import statement:\n     ```python\n     from .ff_adaptive import FFAdaptive\n     ```\n   - The original code snippet confirms this. There are no additional operations, data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n   - **Conclusion:** The reported issues are *not* present in the code. The code is just a straightforward import.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n   - They correctly identify that an import statement alone does not pose security risks.\n   - No logical flaws are evident; the assessments are consistent with the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low or zero security risk.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely an import statement with no suspicious activity, risk scores should remain very low or zero.\n   - No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions—no code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code's simplicity.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis—mostly zero, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code snippet is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code snippet.",
