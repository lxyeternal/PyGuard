  "purpose": "Import the FFAdaptive class from a local module named ff_adaptive",
  "sources": "Import statement reads local module 'ff_adaptive'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed; only an import statement",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a local module, likely part of a larger package. It does not contain any executable logic, user input handling, network communication, or other potentially malicious operations. Since it's a straightforward import, there is no evident malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation. The code alone does not pose any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a basic import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a Python package’s module structure.",
