  "purpose": "Import the FFAdaptive class from a local module named ff_adaptive",
  "sources": "Import statement reading a local module file",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only an import statement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a local module within the package. There are no input handling, network operations, or data processing involved. The import appears standard for modular Python projects and does not indicate malicious intent. Since this is only a single line, no further context is available, but nothing suspicious is detectable from this line alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a modular project structure without any malicious indicators.",
