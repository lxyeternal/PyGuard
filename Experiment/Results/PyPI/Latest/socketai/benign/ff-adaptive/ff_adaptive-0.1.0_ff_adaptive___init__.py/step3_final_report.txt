{
  "purpose": "This code imports the FFAdaptive class from a local module, likely for use within a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs a static import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement, standard in Python modules. It involves no executable logic, data handling, network activity, or user input. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal scope and typical pattern suggest a benign component of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The import statement is standard practice, and no anomalies are detected. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
