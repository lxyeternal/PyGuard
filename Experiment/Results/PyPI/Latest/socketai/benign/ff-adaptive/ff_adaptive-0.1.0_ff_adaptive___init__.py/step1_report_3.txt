{
  "purpose": "Importing the FFAdaptive class from the local module ff_adaptive, likely for use in the current script.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the ff_adaptive module from the same package/directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet, as it only performs an import.",
  "flows": "The code imports a class but does not execute any functions or pass data; no data flow is present here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual features, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet only imports a class from a relative module, which is a common practice in Python packages. No data processing, network activity, or sensitive information handling occurs. The snippet alone does not reveal malicious intent or suspicious behavior. Given the limited content, it appears to be part of a larger program, and the import itself is standard. No signs of malware or malicious obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no malicious or suspicious elements. It indicates the use of a class from a local module, typical in Python projects. No security risks are evident from this snippet.",
