  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports describe a simple import statement:\n     ```python\n     from .ff_adaptive import FFAdaptive\n     ```\n   - There is no executable logic, no data processing, no network activity, no user input handling.\n   - The code is minimal, standard in Python projects, and appears legitimate.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: they correctly identify that this is a straightforward import with no suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The conclusions align with the code snippet's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the lack of obfuscation.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct since there's no malicious activity or indicators.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with a couple of reports assigning 0.1. Given the code's simplicity, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is justified.\n   - **Confidence Levels:** Mostly 1 or 0.9, reflecting high confidence in the benign nature of this code.\n\n4. **Potential Malicious or Vulnerable Aspects:**\n   - The code is purely an import statement, which by itself cannot be malicious.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here.\n   - The import of a class from a local module is a common pattern and poses no security risk unless the module itself is malicious, which cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided code and analysis.\n   - The code does not exhibit any malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - Based solely on this import statement, the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at 0.\n   - If considering the broader context (which isn't provided), the import itself remains benign.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is benign, and the reports correctly reflect that.",
