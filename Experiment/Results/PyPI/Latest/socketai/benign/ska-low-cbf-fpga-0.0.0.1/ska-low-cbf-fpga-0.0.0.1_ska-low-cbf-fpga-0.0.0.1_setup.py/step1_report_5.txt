  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'ska-low-cbf-fpga' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata defined in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior detected. The package description indicates it is a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script with minimal metadata. There are no input handling, dynamic code execution, or potentially malicious constructs. All data are hardcoded static strings meant for package metadata. No suspicious imports, no code injection points, and no secret leaks. The author and email fields are empty but that alone is not malicious. Overall, the script is straightforward and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a placeholder package configuration with no dynamic or malicious elements.",
