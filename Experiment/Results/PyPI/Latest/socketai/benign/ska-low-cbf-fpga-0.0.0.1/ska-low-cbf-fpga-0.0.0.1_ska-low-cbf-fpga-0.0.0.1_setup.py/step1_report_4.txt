{
  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'ska-low-cbf-fpga' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call, which takes package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly sends data, executes untrusted input, or interacts with external systems in a potentially harmful way.",
  "flows": "The code sets static metadata; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The author and author_email fields are empty, which may be unusual but not malicious. The description is a placeholder, indicating the package may be a stub or a template.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata with no dynamic code or input handling. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or code execution mechanisms are present. The package appears to be a placeholder or template for future development, with minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a simple package descriptor with placeholder values.",
