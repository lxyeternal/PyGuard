  "purpose": "A placeholder setup script for a Python package, defining static metadata without dynamic or malicious code.",
  "sources": "Static strings in setup() parameters: name, version, author, author_email, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static metadata without external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields, and a description indicating a placeholder, but these are benign placeholders, not security issues.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic code, external data, or suspicious behaviors. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The only minor concern is the 'securityRisk' score of 0.1 in one report, which is an overestimation given the lack of vulnerabilities. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. The code poses no security threat, and the scores should reflect that.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. All assessments are accurate, and the scores should be set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
