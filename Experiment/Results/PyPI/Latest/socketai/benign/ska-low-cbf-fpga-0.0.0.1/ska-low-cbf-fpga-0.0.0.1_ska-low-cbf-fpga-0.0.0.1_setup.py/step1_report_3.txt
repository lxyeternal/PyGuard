  "purpose": "Define the metadata for a Python package named 'ska-low-cbf-fpga' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values for package name, version, author, author_email, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed. The author and author_email fields are empty, which may be a placeholder but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with static package metadata. There are no dynamic inputs, no code execution, and no suspicious functions or behaviors. The package description indicates it is a placeholder. All code appears to be standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to define package metadata.",
