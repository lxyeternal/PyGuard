  "purpose": "To define the metadata and setup configuration for a Python package named 'ska-low-cbf-fpga'.",
  "sources": "Static source code; no external input or data reads.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or effects; this is a standard package setup script.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely specifies package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields are unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata including name, version, description, and classifiers. No external inputs are read, and no data is transmitted or processed. The script appears to be a minimal, placeholder setup configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or unusual code structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
