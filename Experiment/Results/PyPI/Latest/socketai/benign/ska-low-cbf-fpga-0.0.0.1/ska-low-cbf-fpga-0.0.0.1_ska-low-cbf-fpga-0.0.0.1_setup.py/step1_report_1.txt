{
  "purpose": "Define and package a Python library named 'ska-low-cbf-fpga' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values in the setup() function parameters such as name, version, author, author_email, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data or input could cause security issues. No external data or untrusted sources are used.",
  "flows": "The code assigns static metadata to the package without any data flow from external sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The package description mentions 'security place-holder package,' but there are no hardcoded credentials, malicious scripts, or unusual code behaviors. No obfuscation or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. All parameters are static strings with no dynamic or user input. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The metadata appears benign and typical for a package setup. The only point of note is the placeholder description, but this does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines metadata for a Python package without any suspicious or malicious content.",
