  "purpose": "Unit tests for the OpenAPIParser class to verify parsing functionality, server URL overriding, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input URLs for parsing; mocked HTTP responses and parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or untrusted data being processed in a dangerous manner.",
  "flows": "Input URL → HTTP GET request → Parsing functions → Exception handling (if invalid or unsupported data).",
  "anomalies": "Use of mock responses and exception handling; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests using pytest for the parser module. It employs mocking to simulate network responses and parsing errors. No data is being sent or received from untrusted sources during actual runtime; the code only tests expected behaviors and error cases. The code does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Usage of third-party libraries like requests, pytest, yaml, and json is standard for testing. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a safe, standard testing suite for the parser module. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
