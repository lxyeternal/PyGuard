  "purpose": "Unit tests for the APIClient class in the clapikit.client module.",
  "sources": "Imports: pytest, requests, unittest.mock; mock_spec fixture; test methods which instantiate APIClient and patch requests.request.",
  "sinks": "requests.request call, which could be used to send untrusted data if not properly validated; mock responses used in testing.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of APIClient with mock spec -> calls to _build_url -> request method calling requests.request with URL and parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard unit test code, importing common testing libraries and mocking network requests. It creates a mock OpenAPI specification, tests URL building and request handling, and uses patching to avoid real network calls. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code is purely for testing the APIClient functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, legitimate set of unit tests with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
