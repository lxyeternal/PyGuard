{
  "purpose": "The code is a simple script that prints a greeting message to the console.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the print statement, which outputs a static message.",
  "flows": "There are no untrusted data flows; the code only executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior detected. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a main() function that prints a fixed string. It then calls main() if the script is run directly. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no side effects beyond printing a static message. The code contains no hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic. It appears to be a simple Hello World-like script without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a basic print operation, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
