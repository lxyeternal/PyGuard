  "purpose": "The code defines a simple main function that prints a static greeting message, serving as a basic script with no external dependencies or data processing.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reads; the code only contains a print statement.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the print function, which outputs a static message; no untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code executes a straightforward print.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python script that defines a main() function printing a static message and executes it if run as the main module. It involves no external inputs, data flows, or malicious logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected, and the code poses no security risks. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
