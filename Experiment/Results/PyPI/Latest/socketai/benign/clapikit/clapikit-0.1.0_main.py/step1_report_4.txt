  "sources": "Input sources are not present; the code does not read external input.",
  "sinks": "Output sink is the print statement that outputs to the console.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a main function that prints a static string and executes it if the script is run directly. There are no external data inputs, no use of environment variables, no network connections, and no sensitive data handling. The code is simple, with no complex logic or third-party dependencies. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, straightforward script with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
