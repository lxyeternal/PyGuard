{
  "purpose": "This code sets up pytest fixtures for testing, providing static URLs for an OpenAPI spec and a mock server.",
  "sources": "The fixtures return hardcoded URL strings; no external input or data processing occurs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; URLs are static and used for testing purposes only.",
  "flows": "Fixtures supply static URLs directly to test functions; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, modifies sys.path for local module access, and defines fixtures returning static URLs. There is no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity. The URLs are benign and intended solely for testing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and purpose are clear, and the analysis confirms its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest configuration with static URLs, posing no security risks or malicious intent. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
