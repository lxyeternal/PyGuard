  "purpose": "Configure pytest fixtures for testing a project that likely involves OpenAPI specifications.",
  "sources": "Reading the file path (__file__), environment via sys.path, returning hardcoded URLs.",
  "sinks": "No sink points for untrusted data; no untrusted data processing or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Fixtures provide static URLs; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up test fixtures for URLs and modifies sys.path to include a src directory relative to the current file. All URLs are hardcoded static strings, and the code performs no network connections or data processing. The code appears straightforward and solely for testing setup without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pytest configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines test fixtures with static data and modifies sys.path for test setup purposes.",
