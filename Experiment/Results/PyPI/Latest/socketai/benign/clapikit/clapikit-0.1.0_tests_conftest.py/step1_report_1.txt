  "purpose": "This code sets up configuration and fixtures for pytest testing framework, primarily providing sample URLs for tests.",
  "sources": "Reading fixed URL strings in sample_openapi_url() and mock_server_url() functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions with external inputs are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only returns static URL strings without processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and pytest, modifies sys.path to include a source directory, and defines two fixtures returning static URL strings. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing occurs. No signs of malicious activity or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward pytest configuration file defining test fixtures with static URLs. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
