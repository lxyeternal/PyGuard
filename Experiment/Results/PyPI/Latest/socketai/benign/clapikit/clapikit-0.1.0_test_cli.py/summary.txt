  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward API testing script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The static nature and controlled subprocess calls justify a malware score of 0, an obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
