  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'clapikit' CLI tool that handles OpenAPI specifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data from the setup script and dependencies from the 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script primarily defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. All dependencies are standard, and no malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for command-line interface. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The dependencies are common and do not exhibit any signs of tampering. The code structure follows standard practices for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and legitimate for package distribution.",
