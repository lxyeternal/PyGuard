  "conclusion": "The setup script is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The minimal security risk associated with the CLI entry point is justified by the fact that the setup only registers the entry point without executing it. The actual security implications depend on the implementation of 'clapikit.cli:main', which is not provided. Therefore, the overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be 0, with a very low (0) security risk score reflecting the static nature of the setup."
