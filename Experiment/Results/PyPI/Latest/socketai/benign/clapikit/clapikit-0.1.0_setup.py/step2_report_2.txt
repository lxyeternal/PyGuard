  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the setup script is standard, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks. The confidence is 1, and all scores are 0.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The code is a typical setup.py for a Python package, with static configuration, no dynamic code, no user input, and no suspicious patterns. The dependencies are standard, and the code uses well-known functions.\n\n- **Verdict:**  \n  The report is accurate. No issues found. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the setup script, with no anomalies or malicious code. Confidence is 1, scores are 0.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The analysis aligns with the code. No dynamic execution, no embedded secrets, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Verdict:**  \n  Correct assessment. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the setup script is described as standard, with no suspicious elements. Confidence is 1, scores are 0.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  Consistent with previous reports. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Verdict:**  \n  Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly more detailed, notes that the 'clapikit.cli:main' entry point could invoke user code, but still finds no suspicious code or obfuscation. The securityRisk score is 0.1, confidence 1.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  This is a reasonable observation. The setup script itself is benign, but the actual code executed when invoking 'clapikit' depends on the implementation of 'clapikit.cli:main'. The mention of potential risks here is appropriate.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n  - securityRisk: 0.1 (acknowledging that the code executed at runtime could be malicious, but not evident here)  \n\n- **Verdict:**  \n  The assessment is sound. The slight securityRisk score reflects awareness that the runtime code could be malicious, even if the setup script itself isn't.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, but emphasizes that the actual execution depends on 'clapikit.cli:main'. It assigns a securityRisk of 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  This is accurate. The setup script is benign, but the actual code run when the CLI is invoked could be malicious. The report correctly notes that the security depends on the implementation of 'clapikit.cli:main'.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (no malicious code in setup)  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0.1 (due to potential runtime code execution)  \n\n- **Verdict:**  \n  Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n\n- **Code confirmation:** All reports correctly identify that the setup script is static, standard, and free of malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in reports 4 and 5, which is justified because the actual runtime code invoked by the CLI could be malicious, even if the setup script itself is safe.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code in setup script)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (acknowledging potential runtime risks associated with the CLI entry point, but no evidence in the setup script itself)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The scores are appropriate given the static nature of the setup script, with a small security risk acknowledged due to the runtime execution of code in 'clapikit.cli:main'.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimate |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| Malware           | 0              |\n| Obfuscated        | 0              |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1            |\n\nThe setup script appears safe, but caution should be taken to review the implementation of 'clapikit.cli:main' for any malicious behavior.",
