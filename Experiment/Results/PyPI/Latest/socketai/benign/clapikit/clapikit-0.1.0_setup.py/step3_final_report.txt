  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging the 'clapikit' CLI tool, registering dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static code in setup(), find_packages(), and install_requires; no dynamic input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution or data leaks present in this static configuration.",
  "flows": "Registration of CLI entry point 'clapikit=clapikit.cli:main' without executing it; no runtime data flow in this script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical static setup script using setuptools, with explicit dependencies and CLI entry point registration. No dynamic code, network activity, or data handling is present. The potential concern about the CLI's runtime behavior depends on the implementation of 'clapikit.cli:main', which is outside this script. The assigned security risk score should reflect that the setup process itself is benign, and the actual execution risk depends on the code within the CLI module. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The minimal security risk associated with the CLI entry point is justified by the fact that the setup only registers the entry point without executing it. The actual security implications depend on the implementation of 'clapikit.cli:main', which is not provided. Therefore, the overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be 0, with a very low (0) security risk score reflecting the static nature of the setup.",
