  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'clapikit' CLI tool, specifying dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads metadata about the package, dependencies, and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present; no input or untrusted data handling in this script.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; primarily static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed. Usage of standard setuptools functions and parameters.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points. All code uses conventional functions and parameters. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network operations, or embedded secrets. The dependencies listed are typical for a CLI tool, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for packaging a Python CLI tool. No malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
