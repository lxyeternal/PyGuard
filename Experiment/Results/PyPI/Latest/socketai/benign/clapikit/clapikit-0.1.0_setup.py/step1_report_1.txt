{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'clapikit' CLI tool package, defining metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Code reads static data for package configuration, including package name, version, description, author, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or user inputs; installation and dependency declarations are static.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; dependencies are specified as static strings, and entry point is a predefined function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard setuptools functions and static configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses standard 'setuptools' procedures to define a Python package, dependencies, and CLI entry points. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behavior are present. All dependencies are clearly specified with version constraints. No dynamic code execution or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for Python package distribution.",
