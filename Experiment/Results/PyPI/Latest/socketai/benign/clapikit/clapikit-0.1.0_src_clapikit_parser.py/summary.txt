  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe implementation for parsing OpenAPI specifications. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The risk is minimal and primarily related to external data fetching, which is well-managed. Therefore, the malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1)."
