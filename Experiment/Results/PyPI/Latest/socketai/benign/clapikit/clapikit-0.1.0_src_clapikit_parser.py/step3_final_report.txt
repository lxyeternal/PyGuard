  "purpose": "Parser for OpenAPI specifications from URLs or local files supporting JSON and YAML formats.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests to URLs, reading from local filesystem files.",
  "sinks": "Parsing content into data models; no unsafe data handling or execution.",
  "flows": "Fetch or read content -> parse into data structures -> validate and return spec object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; URL scheme validation in place.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard parsing of OpenAPI specs, validating URL schemes, handling errors appropriately, and supporting multiple formats. It does not execute untrusted code, contain obfuscation, or hardcoded credentials. External URL fetching is performed with basic validation, and the content is parsed safely. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the provided reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential minimal external data fetching risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe implementation for parsing OpenAPI specifications. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The risk is minimal and primarily related to external data fetching, which is well-managed. Therefore, the malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1).",
