  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided or visible, making it difficult to determine its intended functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and potentially from external files or user input, though specifics are not visible due to absence of code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, system commands, or data writes, but these are not explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows can be identified without the code content.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears empty or non-existent; there are no visible code structures, functions, or logic to analyze. The absence of code makes it impossible to identify anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "Given the lack of any visible code, there are no source, sink, or flow patterns to analyze. The code appears to be missing or not provided, resulting in no detectable malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "There is no code present to evaluate for malicious behavior or security risks. The absence of code means no anomalies or malicious intent can be identified. Without actual code, a meaningful security assessment cannot be performed.",
