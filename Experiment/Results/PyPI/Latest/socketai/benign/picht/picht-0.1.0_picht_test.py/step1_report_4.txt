{
  "purpose": "Simulation and visualization of an ion optics system, including lens setup and electron beam trajectories.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and core.IonOpticsSystem; reads system parameters and simulation configurations.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; no external untrusted data sources or outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "System parameters are configured, fields are solved, and beam trajectories are simulated, then visualized. Data flows from input parameters through simulation functions to visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns observed. The code appears straightforward and typical for scientific simulation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries and a core module for ion optics simulation. It sets up a system with specific parameters, adds an Einzel lens, solves the electromagnetic fields, then simulates electron beam trajectories with specified energy and initial conditions. The results are visualized using matplotlib. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification is present. All functions seem to perform typical scientific computation without hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical scientific simulation script for ion optics; it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on the core module for core physics calculations, with no suspicious code or external data manipulation detected.",
