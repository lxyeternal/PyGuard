{
  "purpose": "Simulate and visualize an ion optical system with an electron beam using custom core library functions.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and core.IonOpticsSystem; calls methods on system object (add_einzel_lens, solve_fields, simulate_beam, visualize_system).",
  "sinks": "None evident; data appears to be used solely for simulation and visualization within the scope of the code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to add_einzel_lens, simulate_beam, and visualize_system functions; results used within visualization, no data sent externally or over network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious data handling; the code performs a straightforward physics simulation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries and a custom core module. It initializes an ion optical system with specified dimensions, adds an Einzel lens with defined parameters, solves the electromagnetic fields, then simulates an electron beam passing through the system. The simulation results are visualized using matplotlib. There are no signs of data leaks, network activity, or malicious actions. All function calls appear to be for legitimate physics simulation purposes. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical scientific simulation script for ion optics and electron beam analysis. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely within the context of simulation and visualization, with no suspicious or harmful behavior.",
