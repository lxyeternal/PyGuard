{
  "purpose": "Simulate ion optics system with electron beam trajectories and visualize results.",
  "sources": "Imports libraries (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, and custom module `core.IonOpticsSystem`), reads parameters for lens and beam, and data from `system.simulate_beam()`.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; visualization outputs are local plots.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to `IonOpticsSystem` and its methods, with data flow from `simulate_beam()` to visualization functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a physics simulation using standard scientific libraries and a custom module. It sets up an ion optical system, adds a lens with specified parameters, solves electromagnetic fields, simulates an electron beam with given energy and initial conditions, and visualizes the trajectories. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system calls are present. The code is straightforward, with clear parameters and functions, indicating a benign scientific purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific physics simulation script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
