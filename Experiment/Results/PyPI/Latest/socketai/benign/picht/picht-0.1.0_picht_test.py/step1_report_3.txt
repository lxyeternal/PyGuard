{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up and simulate an ion optics system with a unipotential lens, and then simulate an electron beam passing through it for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules: numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and core.IonOpticsSystem. The code reads parameter inputs for system configuration, lens parameters, and simulation parameters such as energy and number of particles.",
  "sinks": "Visualization with matplotlib.pyplot to display the results. No data is sent over a network or stored externally within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Inputs from user-defined parameters are used to configure the IonOpticsSystem object. The simulation results (trajectories) are then visualized using matplotlib.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious system calls are detected. The code is straightforward, focused on physics simulation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary scientific libraries and a custom core module to set up an ion optics simulation. It defines system parameters, adds a lens with specified voltages and dimensions, solves the electromagnetic fields, then simulates an electron beam with given energy and position, finally visualizing the results. All operations are consistent with typical scientific computing tasks. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a scientific simulation for ion optics without any malicious intent or security risks. It is standard physics computation code with no indicators of malware or supply chain threats.",
