  "purpose": "Simulate and visualize ion optics and electron beam trajectories using a custom core library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for numpy, matplotlib, and core library; creation of IonOpticsSystem instance; parameters for lens and beam; simulation and visualization functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network, file I/O, or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of system object -> configuration of lens -> solving fields -> simulation of electron beam -> visualization of results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of standard scientific libraries. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a simulation environment for ion optics, configures a unipotential lens with specified parameters, computes electric fields, simulates a beam of electrons with specified energy and starting conditions, and visualizes the results. All library functions appear to serve scientific purposes without any hidden or malicious intent. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious actions are evident. The code is straightforward, using well-understood scientific libraries and a custom core module. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific simulation script for ion optics and electron beam analysis. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
