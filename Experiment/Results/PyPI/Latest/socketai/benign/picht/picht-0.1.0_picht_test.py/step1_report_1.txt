{
  "purpose": "The code sets up an ion optical system simulation, adds an einzel lens, solves the electromagnetic fields, simulates an electron beam, and visualizes the results.",
  "sources": "The code reads parameters for system configuration and simulation setup from the function calls and variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to write untrusted data to external sources, nor does it perform any network operations or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (lens and beam parameters) are used in calculations and visualizations; no data flows from untrusted external sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of physical parameters and visualization functions appears standard for a scientific simulation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports scientific libraries and a custom module, sets up an ion optical system, configures a lens with specific parameters, performs electromagnetic field calculations, simulates an electron beam, and visualizes the results. There are no signs of malicious intent such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a typical physics simulation script, with no suspicious behavior or hidden malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific simulation script for ion optics and electron beam analysis. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
