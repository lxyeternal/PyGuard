  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'picht', defining metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading local file; static data passed to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, conventional setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools, with no dynamic input, network activity, or obfuscated code. It reads a local README.md file and supplies static metadata and dependencies. No suspicious patterns, code injection, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned by all reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with the exception of one report assigning a security risk of 0.1, which is unjustified given the simplicity and safety of the script. Therefore, the overall assessment confirms no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly 0; the security risk score should also be 0. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
