{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'picht'.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, calling setup() with package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is processed or written to insecure locations.",
  "flows": "N/A — setup script executes package configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code observed. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a Markdown README for package description, then calls setuptools.setup() with package info, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are standard for Python packaging. No malicious behaviors, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection, are evident. The dependencies are well-known packages and are safe. The script does not process any untrusted input nor includes any suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python library. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
