{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging a Python library called 'picht', an electron optics simulation library for electron microscopy applications.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies defined directly in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution or data leakage mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no untrusted data sources or flows involved in this setup script.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard setup.py pattern used for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a markdown file for description but does not process any user input or external data dynamically. The setup() function contains static package metadata and dependencies. There are no code execution, network activity, or credential handling mechanisms. The script is a straightforward package configuration script with no apparent malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
