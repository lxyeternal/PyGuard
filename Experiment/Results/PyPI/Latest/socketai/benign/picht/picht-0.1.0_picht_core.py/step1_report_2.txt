  "purpose": "The code implements a physics simulation of electron trajectories in a potential field created by electrodes, including field calculation, particle dynamics, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters for electrode configurations, simulation settings, and initial particle conditions.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; potential fields and particle data are used internally for simulation and visualization.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (electrode configs, initial positions, energies) -> field calculation -> particle dynamics -> trajectory outputs and visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code uses standard scientific Python libraries. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected. The logic appears consistent with intended physics simulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for electrode configuration, potential field calculation via iterative relaxation, particle dynamics via Lorentz force approximation, and a system class to manage the simulation. It includes methods for adding electrodes, solving the potential field, tracing particle trajectories, and visualizing results. No unusual or malicious code patterns, network calls, or data leaks are present. The code relies on standard scientific libraries and follows typical design patterns for physics simulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate physics simulation tool without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The design is consistent with standard scientific computation practices.",
