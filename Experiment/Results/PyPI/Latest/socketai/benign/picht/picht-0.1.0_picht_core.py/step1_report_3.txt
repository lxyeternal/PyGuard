  "purpose": "Simulation of electron trajectories through electrostatic fields created by configurable electrodes and lenses.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for electrode configurations, initial particle positions and velocities, and simulation parameters such as energy and time.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as electrode voltages, particle positions, and velocities are used internally but not transmitted or stored externally in the code.",
  "flows": "Electrode configurations set potential fields; potential fields influence particle dynamics; particle trajectories are computed via ODE solving based on field gradients.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code segments. No network communication, obfuscation, or data exfiltration mechanisms present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a physics-based simulation for electron trajectories in electrostatic fields. It uses standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib). The potential field solver employs iterative relaxation, and particle tracing uses numerical ODE solvers. No suspicious patterns such as data exfiltration, remote communication, or hidden code logic were detected. All functions serve transparent computational purposes related to physical simulation. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific simulation tool for modeling electron trajectories in electrostatic systems. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks within this code segment.",
