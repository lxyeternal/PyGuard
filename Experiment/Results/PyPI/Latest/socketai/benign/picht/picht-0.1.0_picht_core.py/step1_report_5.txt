  "purpose": "The code simulates electric potential fields, particle trajectories, and beam optics in an electron beam system, including the addition of electrodes and lenses for beam focusing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as electrode configurations, voltages, initial particle positions, velocities, and simulation parameters. These are used within class methods to configure the field and simulate trajectories.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the code could process or transmit data, but there are no explicit network, file I/O, or data exfiltration actions. No external data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The potential field is set up via electrode configurations, solved iteratively, and then used to obtain electric field vectors at specific points. These fields inform particle dynamics which are integrated over time to generate trajectories.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behavior are present. The code uses standard scientific computing libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib), with no obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or code injection mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical physics simulation for electron beam optics. It defines classes for electrodes, potential field calculations, particle tracing, and a system to assemble these components. The potential field solver employs a standard iterative Laplace equation approach with convergence criteria. Particle trajectories are computed via numerical integration. The system visualizes the results using matplotlib. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. All data flow is contained within the simulation context without external communication or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward physics simulation module for modeling electron trajectories in a potential field, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It uses common scientific libraries for computational purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. Overall, it appears safe and intended for scientific or educational use.",
