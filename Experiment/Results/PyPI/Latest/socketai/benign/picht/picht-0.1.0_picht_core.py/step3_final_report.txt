  "purpose": "The code models electrostatic potential fields generated by electrodes and traces electron trajectories within these fields, primarily for physics simulations and visualization.",
  "sources": "Electrode configurations, potential field calculations, and initial particle positions and velocities serve as data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs visualizations of particle trajectories; no data leaks, network activity, or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Electrode configurations set potentials -> potential field is solved -> field gradients are computed -> particle trajectories are traced using field data -> visualizations are generated.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward scientific simulation.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib) for physics modeling. It defines classes for electrode configuration, potential field calculation, particle tracing, and system assembly. The potential field solver uses iterative relaxation, and particle trajectories are computed via numerical integration. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The code's purpose and data flow are transparent, and no suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured physics simulation tool with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It employs standard methods and libraries, with no suspicious behaviors or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero.",
