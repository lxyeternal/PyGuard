{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and imports specific classes from the core module.",
  "sources": "Package metadata (__version__, __author__, __email__), import statement from .core",
  "sinks": "Potentially imported classes from core module, but no direct untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "Metadata assignment flows into the package info; import flows into the module namespace",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets beyond author info, no dynamic execution or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, establishing package metadata and importing classes from a local module. No external input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns detected. The imported classes are likely part of the package's functionality, but their content is not shown here. No indications of malicious behavior or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package metadata and import statements with no malicious or security concerns.",
