  "purpose": "Define module metadata and import core classes related to potential fields, particle tracing, and ion optics system configurations.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__, __author__, __email__, and import statements from .core",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs; no external data handling or network operations",
  "flows": "No significant data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks; imports are static",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns module metadata variables and imports specific classes from a local module. There are no dynamic data inputs, network communications, or potentially malicious behaviors. The imported classes are part of the module's core functionality and do not exhibit malicious intent based on this snippet. No signs of obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module metadata and import declaration with no malicious or security concern indications.",
