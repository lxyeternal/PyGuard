  "purpose": "Define module version and author information, and import specific classes from a local core module.",
  "sources": "Module metadata (__version__, __author__, __email__), import statement from local .core module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import statements are static and do not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials (besides author info), or hidden operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py file setting version and author info, and importing classes from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The imported classes may be relevant to a physics or engineering context but do not show malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package initialization file with no malicious or security concerns.",
