  "purpose": "Package initialization script setting metadata and importing core classes",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __email__), local module import (.core)",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static imports and metadata assignments only",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns; straightforward structure",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python __init__.py file defining package metadata and importing classes from a local module. It contains no dynamic code execution, external input handling, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The only minor inconsistency is in report 4, which assigns a security risk score of 0.1; given the code's simplicity, this should be adjusted to 0.0. All reports correctly assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0. The overall assessment confirms the code is safe and free of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The security risk score should be 0, aligning with the code's harmless nature. All reports are accurate except for a slight overestimation in report 4, which should be corrected.",
