{
  "purpose": "A Unicode UTF-8 Bangla to Bangtex converter that transforms source text files into a specific TeX/LaTeX format.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.converter' (convert_text, convert_file)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data transmission, network, or file manipulation code present",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported functions to external callers through exposed functions; no untrusted input handling shown",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module defining metadata, documentation, and importing functions from a local module. It does not include any code that reads user input, handles environment variables, or performs operations that could lead to data leakage or malicious behavior. The import is from a relative module, which suggests modular code organization but does not indicate malicious intent. The licensing and version info do not impact security analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module for text conversion with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It only exposes functions imported from a local module and contains no executable code that interacts with the system or network.",
