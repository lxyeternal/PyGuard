  "purpose": "Convert Unicode UTF-8 encoded Bangla text files into Bangtex format for TeX/LaTeX.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.converter' (convert_text, convert_file). No external data sources or input reading directly shown.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points are evident; the code only re-exports functions from another module.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flows within this snippet; it merely imports and exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "This script defines metadata and imports functions from a local module. It includes license and author info, but contains no input handling, network operations, or other potentially malicious actions. The code structure and comments are typical for a library module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign library module for text conversion, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a minimal, well-structured import/export file without any suspicious elements.",
