  "purpose": "A minimal Python module that sets metadata and imports conversion functions for Bangla to Bangtex conversion.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module '.converter'",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external interactions present",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process data or execute logic",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and metadata setup with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup with no executable logic, input handling, or network activity. It imports functions from a local module, which is standard practice. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports correctly assess the code as safe, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
