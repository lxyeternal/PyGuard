  "purpose": "The code provides a Bangla to Bangtex converter, intended to process Unicode UTF-8 encoded Bangla text files for TeX/LaTeX conversion.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from a local module `.converter` (convert_text, convert_file). No other input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or output in this code fragment. It exports functions but does not invoke or execute them.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources within this snippet; it only defines and exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package init file.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily serves as an initializer for a package, importing functions from a local module. It contains license info, versioning, and exports. No code execution, user input, or network communication is present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign part of a Python package intended for text conversion, with no malicious intent or security risks detected within this fragment.",
