  "purpose": "The source code serves as a module for converting Unicode UTF-8 encoded Bangla text into Bangtex format for TeX/LaTeX.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions 'convert_text' and 'convert_file' from a local module '.converter'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this snippet; potential sinks would be within the imported functions if they process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing conversion functions, which would process data when called elsewhere. No direct data processing or input handling is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "This code primarily defines metadata and imports functions from a local module. It does not include any data input, network communication, or execution of untrusted code. It appears to be a standard module setup with versioning and export definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is part of a larger project, and the imported functions may process data, but based solely on this snippet, there is no malicious intent or security risk.",
