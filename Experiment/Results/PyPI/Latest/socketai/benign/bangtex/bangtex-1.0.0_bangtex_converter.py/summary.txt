  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex regex-based Bangla to Bangtex transliteration utility. It contains no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is justified as 0. The regex complexity is for linguistic parsing, not malicious obfuscation. The overall security assessment indicates a benign component suitable for supply chain inclusion."
