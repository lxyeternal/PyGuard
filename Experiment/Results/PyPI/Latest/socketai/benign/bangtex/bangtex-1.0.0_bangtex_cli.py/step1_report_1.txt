{
  "purpose": "Command-line interface for converting Bangla text from UTF-8 to Bangtex format",
  "sources": "Argument parser reads command-line arguments and input file (if provided); convert_file function imported from local module",
  "sinks": "Potential output file writing; the convert_file function could write data to files or stdout",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments → convert_file function → output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behaviors observed; use of local module convert_file is standard",
  "analysis": "The script defines a CLI that accepts input and output files and a flag for token display. It imports a convert_file function, which is presumed to perform the conversion. There are no indications of data being sent over the network, backdoors, or malicious system modifications. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts. Importantly, the actual functionality depends on the convert_file implementation, which is external and not provided here. Based solely on this code, there are no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper for a converter function, with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. Its safety depends on the implementation of convert_file, but this script itself does not introduce risks.",
