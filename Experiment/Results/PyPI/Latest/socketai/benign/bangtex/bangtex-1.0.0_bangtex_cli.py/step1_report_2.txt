  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for converting Bangla text to Bangtex format.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments and input files specified by the user.",
  "sinks": "Calls convert_file, which processes input and output files.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> convert_file -> file I/O operations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of relative import '.' is standard for package modules.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments for input and output files and an option to show unicode tokens. It then calls the convert_file function with these arguments. No code injection, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The code structure is straightforward, standard for CLI tools, and lacks any obfuscated or suspicious patterns. There are no hardcoded credentials or sensitive data. Since convert_file is imported from a local module, its implementation is not visible here; thus, potential issues could reside there, but based on this code alone, nothing malicious is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper for a conversion function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs input validation via argparse but does not process untrusted data directly beyond file I/O, which is typical for such scripts.",
