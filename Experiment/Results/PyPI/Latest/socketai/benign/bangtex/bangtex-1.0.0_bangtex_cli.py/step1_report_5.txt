  "purpose": "Command-line interface for converting Bangla text from utf8 to Bangtex format",
  "sources": "Reads input filename from command-line argument or stdin; reads flags like '-d' and '--output'",
  "sinks": "Calls convert_file() with input and output filenames; potential to process untrusted files",
  "flows": "User inputs data via file or stdin, which is passed to convert_file for processing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed; uses standard argparse and import patterns",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an argument parser, captures input/output file parameters and a flag, then calls convert_file() with these parameters. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network connections, or data leaks evident. The only external dependency is the convert_file() function imported from a local module, which cannot be evaluated here. The code appears to serve a legitimate CLI purpose without malicious intent or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward CLI wrapper around a conversion function, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles user inputs securely and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
