  "purpose": "Command-line interface for converting Bangla text from UTF-8 to Bangtex format.",
  "sources": "Input file provided via command-line argument or stdin; environment variables (not explicitly used but could be in imported modules).",
  "sinks": "The convert_file function likely reads and writes files based on arguments; no direct sinks in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed and passed to convert_file, which processes input and output files as specified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that uses argparse to parse arguments and calls convert_file with these parameters. There are no suspicious data flows, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls visible. The import of convert_file suggests core logic is in an external module, but nothing suspicious is indicated here. The script operates as expected for a typical CLI tool, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI wrapper for a converter utility, with no malicious intent or security risks evident in this snippet.",
