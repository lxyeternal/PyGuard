{
  "purpose": "The class provides encoding (encryption) and decoding (decryption) of strings using character replacement mappings, possibly for obfuscation or simple encoding purposes.",
  "sources": "Input strings to encrypt() and encrypted strings to decrypt() methods, which receive data for transformation.",
  "sinks": "The methods perform string replacements without external data sinks, but if the output or decrypted data is used elsewhere, it could be misused or misrepresented.",
  "flows": "Input string → encrypt() applies character replacements to produce encoded output; encoded string → decrypt() reverses replacements to recover original string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of replacement characters (like 'â') which might indicate encoding issues or obfuscation; no use of environment variables, network, or system calls; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution or external dependencies; presence of special characters in replacements suggests potential obfuscation, but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward character substitution cipher with separate methods for encoding and decoding. The mapping is extensive but static, with no external data input or output beyond string transformations. No code injection, data leakage, network activity, or system modifications are present. The unusual characters used as replacements are consistent and do not indicate obfuscation of malicious code, rather they appear to be part of a custom encoding scheme. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage such as data theft, backdoors, or system compromise. The use of replacement characters like 'â' could be a sign of encoding artifacts or minor obfuscation but not malicious. Overall, the code's behavior is benign and limited to string replacement logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple, static character substitution encoding and decoding without any malicious or suspicious activity. It appears to serve as a basic obfuscation or encoding mechanism. There is no evidence of malware, data leaks, or malicious intent.",
