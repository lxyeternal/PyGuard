{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode and decode strings using a character replacement cipher, effectively obfuscating and de-obfuscating data.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken from method parameters 'string' in 'encrypt' and 'encrypted_token' in 'decrypt'.",
  "sinks": "The code writes transformed data back into the return value; no direct sink operations such as file or network I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through sequential character replacements during encryption and decryption; no external or untrusted data flows outside these transformations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a straightforward character substitution cipher without any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden code segments. The replacement operations are explicit and static. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods that perform character-by-character substitutions for obfuscation purposes. The 'encrypt' method replaces specific characters with emoji or special characters, while the 'decrypt' method reverses these mappings. Both methods perform only string replacements with no external interactions, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. The logic is transparent and consistent, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The purpose appears solely to obfuscate data via character substitution.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a simple character substitution cipher for obfuscation, not encryption. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it perform any dangerous operations. The code is straightforward, transparent, and safe, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
