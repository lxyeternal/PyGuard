  "conclusion": "The code itself is a code obfuscation and encryption utility that, due to its use of dynamic execution (exec()) on decrypted content, can be exploited to run malicious payloads if encrypted data is malicious. Its obfuscation techniques further conceal potential malicious intent. While not inherently malicious, its architecture introduces a high security risk when handling untrusted encrypted payloads, warranting a malware score around 0.3, obfuscation score around 0.6, and overall security risk around 0.6–0.75."
