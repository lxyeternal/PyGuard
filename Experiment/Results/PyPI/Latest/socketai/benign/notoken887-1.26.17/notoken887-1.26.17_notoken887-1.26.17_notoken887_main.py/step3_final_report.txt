  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code; potential for executing malicious payloads if encrypted content is malicious.",
  "flows": "Input file read -> encryption/decryption -> embedding into self-decrypting code -> exec() of decrypted code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on decrypted content; obfuscation via smashing code into one line with special characters; embedding encrypted payloads as strings.",
  "analysis": "The code reads Python files, encrypts/decrypts content using TokenCryptor, obfuscates code by smashing into one line with special characters, and executes decrypted code via exec(). No hardcoded credentials or network activity are present. The primary security concern is the use of exec() on decrypted data, which can execute malicious code if the encrypted payload is malicious. Obfuscation techniques hinder static analysis but are not inherently malicious. The code functions as a utility for code concealment but poses a significant security risk if misused. The potential for malicious payloads exists if encrypted data is crafted maliciously, making the code a vector for supply chain attacks or malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is a code obfuscation and encryption utility that, due to its use of dynamic execution (exec()) on decrypted content, can be exploited to run malicious payloads if encrypted data is malicious. Its obfuscation techniques further conceal potential malicious intent. While not inherently malicious, its architecture introduces a high security risk when handling untrusted encrypted payloads, warranting a malware score around 0.3, obfuscation score around 0.6, and overall security risk around 0.6–0.75.",
