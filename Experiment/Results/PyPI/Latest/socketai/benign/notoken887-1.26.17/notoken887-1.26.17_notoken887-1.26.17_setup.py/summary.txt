  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign and standard, with suspicious metadata that warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. The security risk score should remain around 0.2-0.3 due to metadata concerns. Further review of the 'notoken887.main' module is recommended to confirm its safety."
