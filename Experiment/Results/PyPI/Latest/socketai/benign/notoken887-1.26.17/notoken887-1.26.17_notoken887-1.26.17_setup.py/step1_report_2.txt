  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887' including metadata, packages, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Code reads static package metadata, package discovery via find_packages(), and defines console script entry point.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; setup configuration is static and does not process external input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Author email is suspicious ('hitler@gmail.com'), which may indicate inappropriate or malicious intent. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py for Python packaging, specifying package details, classifiers, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, external input processing, or suspicious behavior is present. The only noteworthy aspect is the questionable author email, which could be a sign of malicious intent or trolling, but technically does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious code or security risks. The only concern is the author email address, which is inappropriate and unprofessional but not malicious. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
