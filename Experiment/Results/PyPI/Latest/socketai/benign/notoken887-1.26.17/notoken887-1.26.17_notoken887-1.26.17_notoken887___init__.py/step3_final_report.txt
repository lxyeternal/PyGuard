  "purpose": "No actual code provided; only high-level descriptions and assessments.",
  "sources": "No sources identified due to absence of code; mentions of data processing, configuration, or system interactions are general and unspecified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data flows or potential data leaks evident.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected; all reports acknowledge the absence of concrete code or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly recognize the absence of code, leading to low suspicion levels. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0–0.3) are appropriate given the incomplete information. Slight overestimations of risk scores (e.g., 0.2–0.3) are acceptable but could be slightly lowered to 0, as no evidence supports risk. Confidence levels are generally high, reflecting the lack of suspicious activity. The reasoning across reports is cautious and justified, avoiding false positives.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of actual code and concrete evidence, all reports' assessments are appropriate. The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and risk scores should be adjusted to 0 for a more conservative stance. Overall, the evaluations are consistent and reasonable given the limited data.",
