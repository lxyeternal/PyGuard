  "purpose": "Initialize logging configuration and set a start index for BiLLM based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('BiLLM_START_INDEX') to read environment variable",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data processing or output manipulation",
  "flows": "Environment variable read (source) to variable assignment (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for configuration purposes",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and logging modules, sets a default start index for BiLLM, and allows overriding via environment variable. It configures basic logging. No user input, no untrusted data handling beyond environment variable access, which is normal for configuration. No malicious code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration snippet for setting up logging and environment-based parameters. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
