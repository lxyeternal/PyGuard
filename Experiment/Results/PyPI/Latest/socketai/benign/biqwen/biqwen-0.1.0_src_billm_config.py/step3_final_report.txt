  "purpose": "Configure the start index for BiLLM from environment variables and set up logging.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'BiLLM_START_INDEX' read via os.getenv",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed beyond environment variable reading",
  "flows": "Environment variable value assigned to BiLLM_START_INDEX, used for configuration",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no suspicious or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, reads an environment variable with a default, and sets up logging. No data processing, external communication, or malicious patterns are present. The environment variable usage is typical for configuration, and the code is clear and simple. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks. The environment variable usage is standard and safe. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
