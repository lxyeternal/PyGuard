  "purpose": "Initialize configuration for BiLLM with optional environment variable override",
  "sources": "os.getenv('BiLLM_START_INDEX', 0)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Environment variable reading flow from os.getenv to BiLLM_START_INDEX",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard library functions",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and logging modules, sets up a configuration variable BiLLM_START_INDEX based on an environment variable with a default of 0, and configures basic logging. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The environment variable is used solely to configure an index value; there are no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures. Logging setup is standard, and the code does not perform any data transmission or sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple configuration setup without any malicious intent or security issues. It reads a configuration value from the environment and sets up logging, both standard practices.",
