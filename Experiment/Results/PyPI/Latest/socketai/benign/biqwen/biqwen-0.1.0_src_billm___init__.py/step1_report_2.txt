{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module initialization file that imports components from other modules related to 'modeling_qwen2' and 'modeling_qwen3'. It sets a version string for the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current directory's modules 'modeling_qwen2' and 'modeling_qwen3' during import.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or potentially leaked.",
  "flows": "The code's flow is limited to importing modules; no data flow from external sources to sinks is observable.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal, serving only as an initializer that imports other modules. It does not process input, generate output, or execute any logic beyond imports. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors, are evident. The use of relative imports is standard in package structures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module initializer with no malicious intent or security concerns. It functions solely to include other modules and set a version, with no suspicious or harmful behavior detected.",
