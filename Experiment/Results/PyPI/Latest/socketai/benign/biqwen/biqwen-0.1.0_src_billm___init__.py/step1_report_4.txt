{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports everything from two submodules, 'modeling_qwen2' and 'modeling_qwen3', and sets a version string. Its purpose is likely to aggregate or re-export functionalities from these modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.modeling_qwen2' and '.modeling_qwen3'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external data outputs observed",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink pathways are evident in this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure which components are imported, potentially hiding malicious code or unintended behaviors; however, this is not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports all definitions from two local modules, which could potentially hide malicious code if those modules contain harmful content. The code itself is minimal and does not perform any suspicious actions. There are no visible data inputs, outputs, or security-sensitive operations. The version string suggests the package is in early development or a simple prototype. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are present. The reliance on imported modules necessitates review of those modules separately to ensure security.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward module aggregator with no immediate malicious behavior. However, the use of 'import *' warrants caution, and review of the imported modules is recommended to rule out malicious content. Overall, this fragment alone shows low risk but warrants standard dependency scrutiny.",
