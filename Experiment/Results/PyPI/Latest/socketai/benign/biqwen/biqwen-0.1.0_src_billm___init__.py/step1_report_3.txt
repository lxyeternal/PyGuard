  "purpose": "Import modules related to modeling_qwen2 and modeling_qwen3, and define package version.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.modeling_qwen2 and .modeling_qwen3)",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external communication present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks observed in this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports with wildcard import statements; no apparent malicious behavior, but wildcard imports can obscure imported content and pose maintainability or security concerns",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from two local modules using wildcard imports, which can hide imported functions or variables, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No external network activity, no credential handling, and no code execution based on untrusted data are present. The version string is simply metadata. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are detected. The code is minimal and straightforward, focusing on module imports and versioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization file with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The use of wildcard imports warrants caution for maintainability but is not inherently malicious.",
