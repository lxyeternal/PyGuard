{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules related to 'modeling_qwen2' and 'modeling_qwen3' and sets a version identifier, likely for a larger machine learning or modeling package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .modeling_qwen2 and .modeling_qwen3",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; imports are static and do not process data at runtime",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements and a version declaration. These imports are from local modules and are not inherently malicious. There is no evidence of dynamic execution, external network calls, or data leaks. The use of __version__ is standard practice for versioning in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could be malicious.",
