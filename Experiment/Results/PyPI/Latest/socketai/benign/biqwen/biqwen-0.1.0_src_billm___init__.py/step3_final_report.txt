  "purpose": "Module initializer importing components from modeling_qwen2 and modeling_qwen3, setting version.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules modeling_qwen2 and modeling_qwen3",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or output",
  "flows": "Import statements without data flow or external communication",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*'), which can obscure dependencies and reduce clarity",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer, importing all symbols from two local modules and setting a version string. No malicious code, external communication, or dynamic behavior is present. Wildcard imports are common in __init__.py files but can hinder maintainability. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The primary concern is maintainability due to wildcard imports, but this does not pose a security risk.",
