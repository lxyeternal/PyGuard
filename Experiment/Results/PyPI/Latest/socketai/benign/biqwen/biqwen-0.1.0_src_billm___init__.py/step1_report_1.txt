{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple module that imports components from two other modules, 'modeling_qwen2' and 'modeling_qwen3', and defines a version string. Its purpose is likely to aggregate or re-export functionalities from these modules for use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing all contents from 'modeling_qwen2' and 'modeling_qwen3'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; no handling of untrusted input or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can be risky as it obscures which components are imported, but it is a common pattern in Python package __init__.py files. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious instructions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all functions or classes from two modules, which can make it harder to track dependencies but is not inherently malicious. The version string indicates a development or initial version. No external data is read, and no operations are performed that could be exploited. The overall structure suggests this is an initializer or aggregator script, typical in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code snippet. It functions as a straightforward module initializer or aggregator. The use of wildcard imports is a potential concern for clarity but not security. Overall, the code appears benign.",
