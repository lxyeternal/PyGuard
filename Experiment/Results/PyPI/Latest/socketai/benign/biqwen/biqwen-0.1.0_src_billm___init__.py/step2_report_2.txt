  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code snippets are straightforward, consisting solely of import statements with wildcard (*) from local modules and a version string.\n- No evidence of data processing, external communication, or dynamic behavior.\n- Wildcard imports are generally discouraged for maintainability but are common in package __init__.py files.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a module initializer importing from two modules, with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — perhaps slightly overcautious; minimal risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence that code is benign.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Also correctly notes that this is a minimal import module with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no risks detected.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very certain.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous, notes the use of relative imports and wildcard imports, with no malicious signs.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — again, perhaps overly cautious, but acceptable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Recognizes the import pattern and the potential maintainability concern with 'import *', but no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher due to wildcard import concern, but still low.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6 — moderate.\n- **Verdict:** **Acceptable.** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a simple import and version declaration, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no risks.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high certainty.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the actual code content.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly very low, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n\n- The risk scores could be uniformly set to 0, given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n- The malware scores are correctly assigned as 0.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is a standard module initializer with wildcard imports, which are common in package __init__.py files. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The import pattern warrants caution for maintainability but not security.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the imported modules ('modeling_qwen2' and 'modeling_qwen3') separately to ensure they do not contain malicious code, as the current file alone appears benign.",
