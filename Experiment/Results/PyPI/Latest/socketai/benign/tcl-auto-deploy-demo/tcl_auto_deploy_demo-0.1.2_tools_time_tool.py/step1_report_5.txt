  "purpose": "A utility class for querying and returning the current system time.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time via datetime.now() as input data.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs current timestamp and formatted string; no external data sinks or network communication.",
  "flows": "The source is datetime.now(), which provides system time; the data flows directly into the return dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. No suspicious external calls, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for time querying with simple, standard methods. It uses the system clock to get current time and formats it for return. No external inputs, data leakage, or malicious behavior present. No suspicious code flows or anomalies identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for retrieving current system time, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
