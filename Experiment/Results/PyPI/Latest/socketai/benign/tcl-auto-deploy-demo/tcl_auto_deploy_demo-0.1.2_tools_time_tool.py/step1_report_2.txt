{
  "purpose": "A utility class providing current time querying functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time via datetime.now(). No external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that process untrusted input; the method returns system-generated time data.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the data is generated internally and returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward time retrieval without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class TimeQueryTool inheriting from BaseTool, with initialization and cleanup methods that log actions. The key method query_current_time retrieves the current system time and formats it into a dictionary with timestamp and formatted string. There are no external data inputs, no use of environment variables, no code injection, or malicious behavior. The code is simple and standard for such a utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic, safe time query function without any malicious intent or security issues. It is a standard utility implementation with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
