{
  "purpose": "A utility class for querying the current system time, likely used as a plugin or component within a larger system.",
  "sources": "Input sources include no external inputs; data is generated internally via datetime.now().",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only returns system-generated time data.",
  "flows": "No external data flows; internal data generation and return only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs straightforward time retrieval with no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from BaseTool, with initialization and cleanup methods that log activity. The core method query_current_time asynchronously retrieves the current system time and formats it into a dictionary containing a timestamp and a formatted string. There are no external inputs, no use of environment variables, and no network operations or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a simple, well-structured utility for time querying, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for obtaining current time information. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It is safe and straightforward.",
