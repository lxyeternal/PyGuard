  "purpose": "A utility class for querying and returning the current date and time information",
  "sources": "The code reads system time via datetime.now()",
  "sinks": "The code returns a dictionary containing timestamp and formatted time, which are derived from system time; no untrusted data source or external sink is involved",
  "flows": "The source (datetime.now()) flows directly into the return statement to provide current time data",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation present; use of standard library functions only",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for time querying with methods for initialization, cleanup, and querying current time. It uses standard Python datetime functions and does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. No malicious or maliciously misleading code observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for retrieving the current system time. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code fragment.",
