  "purpose": "A simple utility class to retrieve and format the current system time asynchronously.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time via datetime.now() within the query_current_time method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; the code only returns system time data.",
  "flows": "System time (source) -> query_current_time() method -> output dictionary with timestamp and formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard library usage and no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an asynchronous class with initialization and cleanup methods that log actions. The core method retrieves current system time and returns it in both timestamp and formatted string. No external inputs, network calls, or data manipulations are present. The code performs a benign, well-understood function with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for querying system time, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
