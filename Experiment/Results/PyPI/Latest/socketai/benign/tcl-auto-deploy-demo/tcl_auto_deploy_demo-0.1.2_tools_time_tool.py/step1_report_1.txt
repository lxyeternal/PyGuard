{
  "purpose": "A utility class for querying the current date and time information.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time using datetime.now() within the query_current_time method.",
  "sinks": "The data output (timestamp and formatted time) could be used downstream, but there are no untrusted data sources or sinks performing unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "System time (source) -> query_current_time method -> output dictionary (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and standard for a utility tool.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for time querying with proper initialization and cleanup methods. The core function retrieves the current system time and formats it into a dictionary. No external data sources, user inputs, or network interactions are present. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a benign utility for time retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign time utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It operates only on system time and outputs formatted data. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are detected.",
