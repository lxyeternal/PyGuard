  "purpose": "Export a class named TimeQueryTool from a local module for use as a time querying utility.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .tool import TimeQueryTool' that reads a class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply imports and exports a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a class from a local module and declares an export. It contains only minimal boilerplate code with no external data handling, no user input, no network activity, or suspicious logic. The comments are in Chinese, indicating the purpose as a 'Time query toolkit', which aligns with its apparent function as a utility package. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module export with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign component of a larger project intended to provide time querying functionality.",
