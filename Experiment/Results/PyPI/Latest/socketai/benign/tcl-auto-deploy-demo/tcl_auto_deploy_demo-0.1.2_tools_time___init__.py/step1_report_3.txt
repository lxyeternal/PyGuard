{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define an interface for a time query utility package, likely providing time-related query functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module '.tool' which is expected to contain the implementation of TimeQueryTool.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the local module import to the exported __all__ list, with no data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as an interface or wrapper, exposing the TimeQueryTool class for external use. It imports a local module and defines the exported symbol. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues in this snippet. The simplicity and lack of dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling suggest no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple module initializer exposing a time query utility class. There are no signs of malicious code, supply chain attacks, or security risks present in this fragment.",
