  "purpose": "Expose or provide access to the TimeQueryTool class from the local tool module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.tool'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow leading to potential vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow analysis needed as the code only imports and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement importing TimeQueryTool from a relative module, and an __all__ declaration to specify export. There are no inputs, external data handling, or operations that could be malicious. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module export with no malicious or security-related concerns.",
