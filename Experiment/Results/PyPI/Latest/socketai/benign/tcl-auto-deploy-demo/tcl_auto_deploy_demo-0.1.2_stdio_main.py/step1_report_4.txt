  "purpose": "Initialize and run an MCP server in stdio mode, loading tools dynamically based on configuration.",
  "sources": "settings.TOOLS_CONFIG for tool configurations, load_tool() function for loading tools, sys.argv (not explicitly used), and environment variables if any are indirectly involved.",
  "sinks": "Tool methods and MCP server run method, which handle incoming and outgoing data streams.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from settings to tool loading, and untrusted data flows through the stdio server during runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, and no hidden network activity or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads configurations, initializes tools, registers methods, and runs an MCP server over stdio streams. It handles errors gracefully and cleans up resources. No suspicious or malicious actions, such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident. The use of load_tool() could potentially introduce malicious tools if the function itself is compromised, but this is outside the scope of the provided code. Overall, the code performs standard initialization and resource management without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate server initialization script for an MCP service, loading tools based on configuration and running over stdio. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment.",
