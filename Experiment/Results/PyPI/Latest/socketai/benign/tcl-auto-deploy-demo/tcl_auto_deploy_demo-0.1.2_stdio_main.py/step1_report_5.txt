{
  "purpose": "Initialize and run a standard I/O based MCP server with dynamically loaded tools, handling tool registration and cleanup.",
  "sources": "settings.TOOLS_CONFIG (reads tool configurations), load_tool function (loads tools), environment variables (possibly via settings or load_tool), sys (reads system exit status), and asyncio streams (read/write streams).",
  "sinks": "mcp.add_tool (registers methods, potentially handling untrusted input if methods process external data), asyncio.run (executes main async function), sys.exit(1) (terminates process on error).",
  "flows": "Configuration data from settings.TOOLS_CONFIG → load_tool → tool initialization → mcp.add_tool (registering methods) → stdio_server streams → mcp server run loop.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. Usage of dynamic loading via load_tool could be suspicious if load_tool is malicious, but this depends on external implementation. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code loads tools based on configuration, initializes them asynchronously, registers their methods with an MCP server, and runs the server over stdio streams. No embedded or hardcoded secrets, no network connections beyond standard server operation, and no suspicious code constructs are present. Error handling is conventional, and cleanup occurs after execution. The reliance on external functions like load_tool could pose risk if those functions are malicious, but within this code, there's no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard server initialization routine with dynamic tool loading. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident within this code segment. External functions and configurations should be verified separately for security, but the code itself does not contain malicious or suspicious constructs.",
