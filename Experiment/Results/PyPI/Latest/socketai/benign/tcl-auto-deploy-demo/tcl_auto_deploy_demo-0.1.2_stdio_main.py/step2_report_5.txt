  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Clarifies dynamic tool loading and registration.\n- Key points: Uses `load_tool`, registers methods, no suspicious patterns.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.3 (slightly higher due to dynamic loading, but justified)\n- Confidence: 0.8\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, standard server setup.\n- Key points: No suspicious code, straightforward flow.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Focuses on method invocation and lifecycle.\n- Key points: No malicious behavior, standard pattern.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Reiterates standard initialization.\n- Key points: No suspicious activity, standard practices.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, standard setup.\n- Key points: No signs of malicious code, proper error handling.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** The core code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. It relies on external `load_tool`, which could be a vector if compromised, but this is outside static code analysis scope.\n- **Dynamic loading risk:** The main concern is the dynamic loading of tools via `load_tool`. If the function is compromised or the tools are malicious, this could introduce risks. However, the code itself does not execute malicious code directly.\n- **Streams and data handling:** The code manages stdio streams and registers methods, which is typical for plugin-based servers. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration is evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Hardcoded secrets:** None observed.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The main vector is external tools, not the code itself.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code present in the core script.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 — due to dynamic loading, but justified given the context; the core code is not malicious but relies on external components.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The static code is safe.\n- The overall security posture depends on the safety of external tools and `load_tool`.\n- No change needed to the scores based on the static code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2–0.3** — moderate, due to dynamic loading, but acceptable if external tools are trusted.\n\n**Overall, the code is standard, well-structured, and does not contain malicious elements. The main concern is external tool safety, which is outside static analysis scope.**",
