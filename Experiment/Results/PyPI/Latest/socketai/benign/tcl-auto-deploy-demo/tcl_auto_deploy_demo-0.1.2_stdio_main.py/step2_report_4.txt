  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Loads tools dynamically via `load_tool()` based on configuration.\n- Initializes and registers tool methods.\n- Runs an MCP server over stdio streams.\n- Handles exceptions and cleans up resources.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks:** Calls `mcp.add_tool()` with potentially untrusted code—expected in plugin systems.\n- **Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of dynamic loading, which could execute malicious code if `load_tool()` is compromised.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the risk of malicious tools, but the core code itself is safe.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious code, but external tools could be malicious.\n\n**Score justifications:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malware in core code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.3 (moderate, due to potential malicious tools)\n- **Security risk:** Reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's scores are consistent. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks:** Potentially executes untrusted code, but the code itself is standard.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Standard plugin system; no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate server setup.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, mainly due to external tools)\n- **Security risk:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks:** Calls to loaded methods; potential for executing untrusted code.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard setup.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n- **Security risk:** Reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks:** Tool methods and server run, potential if tools are malicious.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n- **Security risk:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks:** Registration of tool methods; potential risk if tools are malicious.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard server initialization.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n- **Security risk:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the core code does not contain malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varies between 0.2 and 0.3, reflecting the inherent risk of dynamic plugin loading.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to external tool loading, but no direct malicious activity)\n\n**Final note:** The core code appears clean, and the primary concern is the trustworthiness of external tools loaded via `load_tool()`. Proper verification of these tools is essential for security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are consistent with the code.\n- No evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n- The risk scores are reasonable, considering the dynamic plugin architecture.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0. and consider maintaining the risk score at 0.2–0.3, emphasizing the importance of verifying external tools.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is a standard plugin-based server setup with no embedded malicious code. The main security concern lies in ensuring the safety of external tools loaded dynamically.",
