  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script initializes an MCP server in stdio mode.\n- It loads tools dynamically based on configuration (`settings.TOOLS_CONFIG`) via `load_tool`.\n- Each loaded tool is initialized, registered with the MCP server, and later cleaned up.\n- The server runs over stdio streams (`read_stream`, `write_stream`).\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or explicit malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The primary security concern is the dynamic loading of external tools, which could be malicious if `load_tool` or the tools themselves are compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code relies on external functions (`load_tool`, `load_tool().initialize()`, `load_tool().cleanup()`) which are not shown here. If these functions are malicious or compromised, they could execute malicious code.\n- Dynamic loading of code always introduces a supply chain risk; the code itself does not perform malicious actions but could facilitate such if the external components are malicious.\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- No apparent logical errors or mistakes in the code.\n- Exception handling is appropriate.\n- Proper cleanup is performed.\n- The code is straightforward and follows standard plugin server patterns.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports — correct, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports — reasonable, as the code itself does not contain malware.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2–0.3 — reasonable, considering the risk from dynamic loading, but no direct malicious activity.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The code **does not** contain malware or malicious code.\n- The **main security concern** is the potential for malicious tools being loaded, which is outside the scope of static analysis.\n- The **scores assigned** (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2–0.3) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- If `load_tool` is from a trusted source, risks are minimal.\n- If `settings.TOOLS_CONFIG` or the environment is compromised, malicious tools could be loaded.\n- The code itself does not perform any network, file, or system modifications beyond what the tools might do.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code in the script)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (moderate, due to external dynamic loading, but no active malicious behavior)\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Verify the integrity and source of `load_tool` and the tools it loads.\n- Consider sandboxing or code signing for tools.\n- Maintain strict access controls on configurations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                | No malicious code present in the core script               |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                | Clear, straightforward code                                |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2              | Dynamic loading introduces some risk; no active malicious behavior observed |\n\nThis analysis aligns with the reports' assessments and reasoning. The core code is safe, but supply chain risks remain due to external tool loading.",
