  "purpose": "Initialize an MCP server in stdio mode, dynamically load tools based on configuration, register their methods, and run the server over stdio streams.",
  "sources": "Configuration settings (settings.TOOLS_CONFIG), external load_tool() function, tool initialization methods",
  "sinks": "Execution of loaded tool methods, registration with MCP server, stream handling for stdio communication",
  "flows": "Configuration -> load_tool() -> tool.initialize() -> register methods -> run server over stdio streams",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic tool loading via load_tool(), which could execute malicious code if compromised; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an MCP server in stdio mode, loads tools dynamically based on configuration, initializes and registers their methods, and manages server execution and cleanup. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The primary security concern is the external load_tool() function and the tools it loads, which could be malicious if compromised. The code itself is straightforward and follows standard plugin server patterns. No suspicious network activity or hardcoded secrets are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.3, reflecting the inherent risk of dynamic plugin loading but no active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The core script is a standard, safe server setup with dynamic plugin loading. No malware or obfuscation is present. The main security risk depends on the trustworthiness of external tools loaded via load_tool(). Static analysis shows no malicious code; scores are consistent with this assessment.",
