{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and runs an MCP server in stdio mode, loading tools based on configuration, and managing their lifecycle.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from 'settings.TOOLS_CONFIG', loads tools via 'load_tool', and reads from stdio streams provided by 'stdio_server'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes tool methods that could be untrusted if loaded from external sources, but the code itself does not perform any dangerous actions such as network connections or file modifications.",
  "flows": "Loads tool configurations -> Loads and initializes tools -> Registers tool methods with MCP -> Uses stdio streams for communication -> Cleans up tools on exit.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward and standard for a plugin-based server initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical server setup: configuration loading, dynamic tool loading, method registration, and running in stdio mode. It handles exceptions and logs errors appropriately. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network manipulation, or hidden backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code flows are evident. The use of dynamic loading and method registration is common in plugin architectures but could be exploited if external tools are malicious; however, this code relies on 'load_tool' which presumably handles safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate server setup routine with no malicious or suspicious elements. It follows standard patterns for plugin-based systems and does not contain any obvious malware or security risks.",
