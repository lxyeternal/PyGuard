{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs an MCP server in stdio mode, loading tools and registering their methods for remote invocation.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from 'settings.TOOLS_CONFIG', loads tools via 'load_tool', and initializes tools with 'initialize()'. It also reads streams for communication via 'stdio_server'.",
  "sinks": "Calls methods obtained from loaded tools, which could potentially execute untrusted code if the tools are malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "Configuration data -> load_tool -> tool.initialize() -> method registration -> run MCP server with stdio streams.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious logic. The code primarily manages tool loading and server setup.",
  "analysis": "The script securely loads tools based on configuration, initializes them, registers their methods, and runs an MCP server over stdio. It properly handles exceptions and performs cleanup. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. The use of dynamic method registration and async streams is standard for such servers. No malicious code or supply chain sabotage indicators are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard server initialization script for an MCP framework, loading tools dynamically and running over stdio. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
