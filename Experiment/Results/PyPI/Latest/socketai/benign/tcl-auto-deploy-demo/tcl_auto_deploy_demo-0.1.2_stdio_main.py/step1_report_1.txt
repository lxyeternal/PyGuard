{
  "purpose": "The script initializes and runs an MCP server in stdio mode, loading and registering tools based on configuration, then managing their lifecycle during server operation.",
  "sources": "Imports from mcp.server.stdio, mcp.server.fastmcp, settings, and core.utils; reads from settings.TOOLS_CONFIG and environment variables; loads tools via load_tool.",
  "sinks": "Calls to mcp.add_tool (potentially executes untrusted code via loaded tools), network or stdio streams (read_stream, write_stream) for data transmission.",
  "flows": "Loads tool configs -> calls load_tool -> initializes tools -> registers tool methods -> runs MCP server over stdio streams -> cleans up tools.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic loading of tools, which can potentially execute malicious code if the tool implementations are compromised; error logging for tool loading failures.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads tools based on configuration, which involves executing external code via load_tool. While this allows flexible extension, it also introduces risk if the loaded tools are malicious. The code sets up an MCP server over stdio streams and manages tool lifecycle properly. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network connections are present. The structure and flow are typical for a plugin-based server setup, with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious backdoors. The main concern is the potential for malicious code in external tools, but this is outside the scope of static analysis here.",
  "conclusion": "The script itself does not contain malicious code but relies on external tools loaded dynamically, which could pose security risks if those tools are compromised. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is present in the core code, but the dynamic loading mechanism warrants caution.",
