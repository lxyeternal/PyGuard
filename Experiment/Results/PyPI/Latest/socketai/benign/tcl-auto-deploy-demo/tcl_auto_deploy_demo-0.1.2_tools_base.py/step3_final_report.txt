  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for tools with lifecycle methods and metadata annotation capabilities.",
  "sources": "Initialization via constructor, class attributes, decorator attaching metadata to methods",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling present",
  "flows": "Decorator marks methods; class provides info; no data flows or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "Unused import 'RequestTimer' but no malicious or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward plugin framework with an abstract class and a decorator for marking tool methods. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. The import 'RequestTimer' is unused but harmless. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The reports correctly assess the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, which are justified given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign plugin base class with no malicious intent or security issues. The scoring in the reports is accurate and appropriate.",
