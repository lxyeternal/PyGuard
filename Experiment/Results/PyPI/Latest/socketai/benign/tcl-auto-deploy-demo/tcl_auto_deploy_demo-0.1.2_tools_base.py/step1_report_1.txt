{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for MCP tools with methods for initialization, cleanup, and retrieving tool info, along with a decorator for tool methods.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (typing, abc, logging, core.utils.RequestTimer); class and function definitions; method decorators",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leakage or code execution",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from the constructor into class attributes; method metadata flows from decorators into method attribute annotations; no external data input or output flows are visible",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated code are present; the code appears straightforward and standard for a class definition",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'BaseTool' with methods for initialization, cleanup, and retrieving information about tools. It uses standard Python features such as decorators to mark tool methods. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network operations, or data processing that could be malicious. The import 'RequestTimer' from 'core.utils' is not used, but its presence alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code structure and flow are typical for a plugin or extension system, with no suspicious or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard abstract base class implementation for a tool framework with a decorator for marking methods. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks within this code segment.",
