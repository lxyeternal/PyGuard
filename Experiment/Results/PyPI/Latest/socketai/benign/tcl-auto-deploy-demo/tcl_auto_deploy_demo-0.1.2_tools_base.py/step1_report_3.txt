  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for MCP tools with methods for initialization, cleanup, and information retrieval, including a decorator for tool methods.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code mainly defines classes, methods, and decorators.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow from untrusted sources; no data processing or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code structure purely for class and method definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be standard class and decorator definitions without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class 'BaseTool' with methods for initialization, cleanup, and retrieving tool info. It also includes a decorator 'tool_method' for marking certain methods as tool methods with metadata. There are no external input reads, no data leaks, no network communications, and no file manipulations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to serve as a structured framework for tool definitions and annotations. Overall, this code is benign and standard for object-oriented design, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard framework for defining tools with decorators and metadata; it contains no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks.",
