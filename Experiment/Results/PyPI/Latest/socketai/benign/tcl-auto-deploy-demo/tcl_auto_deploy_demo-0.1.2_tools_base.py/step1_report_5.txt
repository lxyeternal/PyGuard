  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for MCP tools with methods for initialization, cleanup, and info retrieval, including a decorator for tool methods.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary passed during class instantiation; class attributes and methods",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or output data",
  "flows": "Initialization with config data; method calls that retrieve or describe class methods",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected; use of internal/private methods and decorators are standard",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a base class for tools, providing structured initialization, cleanup, and info functions. The decorator 'tool_method' marks specific methods as tool operations with descriptive metadata. No external data input handling, command execution, or insecure data processing is present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured framework component without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract base class for a tool framework, with no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks. It simply provides structure and decorators for tool method definitions.",
