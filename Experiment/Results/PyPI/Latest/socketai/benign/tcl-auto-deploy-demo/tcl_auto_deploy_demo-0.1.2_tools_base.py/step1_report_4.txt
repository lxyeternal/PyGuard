{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for MCP tools with metadata and method registration, including a decorator for marking tool methods.",
  "sources": "Configuration input via the constructor, class attributes, and decorated methods",
  "sinks": "None evident; code primarily manages class metadata and method annotations without processing untrusted data",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected; use of standard Python features and no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a base class for tools with asynchronous lifecycle methods, a method to retrieve tool info, and a decorator to mark specific methods as tool methods. It uses standard Python features, type hints, logging, and class introspection. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be designed for plugin or extension architecture with no evident security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured abstract base class for tool management, with a decorator to identify tool methods. No malicious activity or security risks are present based on the provided code.",
