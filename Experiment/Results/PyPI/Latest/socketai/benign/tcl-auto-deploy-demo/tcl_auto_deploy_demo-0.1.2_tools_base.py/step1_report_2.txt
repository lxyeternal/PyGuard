  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for MCP tools with initialization, cleanup, and info retrieval functionalities.",
  "sources": "import statements, class constructor, method decorators, and class methods",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data flows that handle untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed; the decorator and class structure are standard",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class 'BaseTool' with methods for initialization, cleanup, and info retrieval, along with a decorator for marking tool methods. It imports standard libraries and a utility 'RequestTimer' from 'core.utils', which is not further analyzed here but appears to be a standard utility. No user input, network operations, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code is well-structured and follows common design patterns for extensibility. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured abstract base class for tools, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate component for a larger system.",
