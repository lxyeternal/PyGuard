  "purpose": "Utility module for request timing, dynamic class loading, and tool initialization",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function arguments: module_path, class_name, tool_config",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import and getattr could execute arbitrary code if inputs are malicious",
  "flows": "load_class receives module_path and class_name from load_tool; load_tool passes tool_config to load_class",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.import_module and dynamic getattr without validation can execute arbitrary code; no explicit security checks or validation on inputs",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for timing and dynamic class loading, primarily for internal use. The load_class function performs dynamic import and attribute access, which can execute arbitrary code if module_path and class_name are controlled by an attacker. load_tool depends on a configuration dictionary, and if the configuration is manipulated, it could lead to loading malicious modules or classes. However, the code itself does not contain any hidden malicious behavior or backdoors. The potential risk is in how inputs are supplied, not in the code logic itself. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for timing and dynamic class loading, with potential security concerns arising only if untrusted inputs are used for module and class names. No malicious behavior or malware is detected within the code itself, but caution should be exercised with external input.",
