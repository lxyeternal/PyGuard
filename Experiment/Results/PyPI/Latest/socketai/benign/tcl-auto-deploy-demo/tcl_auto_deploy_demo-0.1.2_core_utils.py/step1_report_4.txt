{
  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for timing requests and dynamically loading modules and tools.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; 'load_class' and 'load_tool' accept parameters that could originate externally, especially 'module_path', 'class_name', and 'tool_config'.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import and attribute access through 'importlib.import_module' and 'getattr', which could lead to arbitrary code execution if malicious inputs are provided.",
  "flows": "User-provided 'module_path' and 'class_name' flow into 'load_class', which imports modules and retrieves classes; 'load_tool' calls 'load_class' with configurations, potentially executing arbitrary code if inputs are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. Use of dynamic import functions is normal but can be risky if inputs are untrusted. No obfuscated code detected. No suspicious external network activity or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for timing and dynamic class loading. The 'load_class' function relies on user-supplied strings for module and class names, which could potentially be exploited to load malicious modules or classes if inputs are untrusted. 'load_tool' handles configurations that may enable or disable tools, and also invokes 'load_class'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network activity. The overall structure appears standard for plugin-based architectures, with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a general utility module facilitating timing and dynamic module loading. While the dynamic import functions can pose security risks if misused with untrusted inputs, there is no explicit malicious behavior present. The code itself appears benign, serving common purposes without malicious intent.",
