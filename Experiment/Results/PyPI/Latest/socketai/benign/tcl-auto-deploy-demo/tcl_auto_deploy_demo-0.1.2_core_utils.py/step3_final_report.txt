  "purpose": "Utility functions for request timing and dynamic class/tool loading based on configuration.",
  "sources": "External inputs for module_path, class_name, and tool_config dictionary entries.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import and getattr calls that can execute arbitrary code if inputs are malicious or untrusted.",
  "flows": "load_class receives module_path and class_name; load_tool calls load_class and instantiates the class with tool_config.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.import_module and getattr without input validation; no sanitization or whitelisting of inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for timing and dynamic class loading. It uses importlib.import_module and getattr to load modules and classes based on external configuration, which can be risky if inputs are untrusted. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary concern is potential misuse if malicious module or class names are supplied, leading to arbitrary code execution. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk between 0.2 and 0.4) are appropriate, reflecting the inherent risk of dynamic imports without validation. Proper input validation or whitelisting is recommended to mitigate this risk in production environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent. The main security concern is the potential for exploitation via untrusted inputs in dynamic import functions. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no malicious activity is detected.",
