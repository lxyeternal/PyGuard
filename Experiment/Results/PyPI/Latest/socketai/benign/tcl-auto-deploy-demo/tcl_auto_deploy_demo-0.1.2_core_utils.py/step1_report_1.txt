  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for request timing, dynamic class loading, and tool loading based on configuration.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for load_class (module_path, class_name) and load_tool (tool_config), as well as class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import and attribute access in load_class; instantiation of classes in load_tool.",
  "flows": "load_tool calls load_class to import a module and retrieve a class, then instantiates it with the configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of importlib for dynamic loading is standard but can be misused if untrusted input is supplied.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for timing requests and dynamically loading classes and tools. The load_class function imports modules and retrieves classes based on provided strings, which could be risky if these inputs are untrusted. However, this is typical for plugin systems or modular architectures. The load_tool function depends on configuration to determine whether to load and instantiate a class. Error handling is appropriate with logging. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is evident. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or execute code from untrusted sources beyond the intended dynamic import. It appears to be a standard utility code for modular loading.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for timing and dynamic class loading. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. While the use of dynamic import can pose security risks if inputs are untrusted, no explicit malicious behavior or backdoors are present in this code. It should be used with trusted configuration inputs.",
