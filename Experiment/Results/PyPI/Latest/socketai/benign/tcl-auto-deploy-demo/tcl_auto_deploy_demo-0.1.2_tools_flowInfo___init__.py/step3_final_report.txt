{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an interface or re-export point for the Playwright automation tool, specifically exposing the PlaywrightTool class for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports PlaywrightTool from a local module (.tool). No external data sources or inputs are read within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing PlaywrightTool and exposing it via __all__; no data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a class and exposes it. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive operations are evident. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of PlaywrightTool, which is not provided. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of this code. No further issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The main security concern lies in the implementation of PlaywrightTool itself, outside the scope of this snippet.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
