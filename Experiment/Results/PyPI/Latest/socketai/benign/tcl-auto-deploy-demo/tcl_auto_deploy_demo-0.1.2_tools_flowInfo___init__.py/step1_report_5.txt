  "purpose": "This code provides an interface to a Playwright automation tool for navigation and login automation.",
  "sources": "The code imports a module from a relative path (.tool) which presumably contains the implementation of PlaywrightTool.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to exposing the PlaywrightTool class from the imported module; no data processing occurs in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The comments are in Chinese, but they do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a class and exposes it via __all__. There are no input sources, data handling, or suspicious constructs. The import is from a relative module, which is standard in package code. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident. The comments describe functionality but do not influence the code's security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module that exposes a Playwright automation tool class. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
