  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; code does not handle or process external inputs or outputs directly.",
  "flows": "Imports from a local module; no data flow from external sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only minimal module setup with no suspicious or unusual code constructs; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module declaration that imports a class from a local module and exposes it via __all__. There are no external data sources, no dynamic execution, no network calls, and no credential handling. The code appears to be a simple interface definition without any malicious or security-sensitive behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It merely re-exports a class from a local module for external use.",
