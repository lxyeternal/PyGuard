  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a minimal module that imports a class named `PlaywrightTool` from a local module `.tool` and exposes it via `__all__`.\n   - There are no embedded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no data processing within this snippet.\n   - The code is straightforward, serving as an interface or re-export module.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns:**\n   - No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The only potential concern is if the imported `PlaywrightTool` contains malicious behavior, but that cannot be determined from this snippet.\n   - The code does not handle untrusted data, perform external network operations, or manipulate sensitive data directly.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious code in this snippet.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Very low (0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Analysis of Report Reasoning:**\n   - All reports are consistent, emphasizing the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n   - They correctly identify that the actual security implications depend on the implementation of `PlaywrightTool`, which is not shown.\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Recommendations:**\n   - Since the code is minimal and clean, no changes to the scores are necessary.\n   - The main security consideration remains the trustworthiness of the `PlaywrightTool` implementation, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n6. **My Overall Assessment:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n   - **Risk Score:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal risk due to the import of an external class, but nothing suspicious)\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code appears benign and does not present any security risks based on the provided snippet. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
