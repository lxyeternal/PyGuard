{
  "purpose": "This code implements a core server for MCP, managing tool loading, method registration, SSE communication, and server lifecycle management.",
  "sources": "Configuration files (settings), external modules (load_tool), and network requests via SSE endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Method calls, SSE connection handling, and logging client IP addresses.",
  "flows": "Configuration loading → Tool initialization → Method registration → SSE connection handling → Request processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Logging client IP addresses is standard but should be noted for privacy.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured server core that dynamically loads tools, registers their methods, and sets up SSE routes for real-time communication. It uses typical signal handling, logging, and asynchronous context managers. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. External dependencies like 'load_tool' are assumed safe based on context. The code follows best practices for such server applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign server core implementation for MCP with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks. It is clear, maintainable, and aligns with standard server management patterns.",
