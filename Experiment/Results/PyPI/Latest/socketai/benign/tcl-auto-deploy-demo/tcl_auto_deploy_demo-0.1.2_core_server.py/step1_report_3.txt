{
  "purpose": "The code defines the core server logic for an MCP-based system, including initialization, tool loading, route registration, and server management.",
  "sources": "Configuration loading from 'settings', tool loading via 'load_tool', and request data in SSE connection handlers.",
  "sinks": "Method registration into MCP, SSE connection handling, and logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Tools are loaded and registered; route handlers establish SSE connections; server info is logged; cleanup methods invoke tool cleanup functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network calls, no obfuscated code, and no backdoors detected. Use of 'sys.exit(0)' in signal handler is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured for a server application, managing tools dynamically, and setting up SSE routes. No external data is processed in an insecure manner. Logging is used for tracking but does not reveal sensitive info. All network-related functions are standard and related to server operation. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or privacy violations are evident. The code relies on external functions ('load_tool') and configs, but their content does not appear malicious. No suspicious behaviors like data exfiltration, network tunneling, or stealthy actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate core server implementation for managing tools and SSE routes. No indicators of malicious intent or sabotage are detected. It is a typical server setup code without malicious patterns.",
