  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a server core implementation for MCP, handling tool loading, method registration, SSE communication, and server management.\n- They emphasize that the code uses standard libraries, proper signal handling, and dynamic registration of tools and methods.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious network activity are detected.\n- The logs are mainly for informational purposes, with client IP logging being standard.\n- The code appears to follow best practices for such server applications, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:** No issues are evident. The code is consistent, well-structured, and standard for a server setup.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** None identified; the logic appears sound.\n- **Scores given:**\n  - Malware: 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n  - Security risk: Very low (0.1–0.2), justified by the standard practices and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The use of `sys.exit(0)` in signal handlers is standard.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No suspicious external network calls or obfuscated code.\n- No evidence of malicious data flow or system modification.\n- The code manages tools and SSE connections securely and transparently.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- Logging client IP addresses could raise privacy concerns, but this is typical for server logs and not inherently malicious.\n- The code relies on external modules (`load_tool`, `settings`) whose security depends on their implementation, but nothing suspicious is indicated here.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — very low, justified by standard server operations.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, due to privacy considerations (client IP logging), but overall very low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured server core for MCP with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
