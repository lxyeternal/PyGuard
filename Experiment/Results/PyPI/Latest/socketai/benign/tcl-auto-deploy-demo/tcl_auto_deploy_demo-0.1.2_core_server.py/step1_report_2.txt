{
  "purpose": "The code defines the core server class for MCP (likely a messaging or communication platform), handling server initialization, tool loading, signal handling, and setting up WebSocket-like SSE (Server-Sent Events) endpoints for tools and main server communication.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (e.g., mcp.server.fastmcp, starlette, uvicorn), settings module, load_tool function, environment variables potentially via settings, and request data during SSE connection handling.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via request._send in SSE handlers, logging statements, and the use of external tool methods invoked during initialization and handling.",
  "flows": "External configuration loading -> tool initialization and registration -> SSE connection establishment -> data flow during SSE communication and method invocation -> server cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code's structure appears standard for a server setup with dynamic tool registration and SSE endpoints. No obfuscated code, and all functions follow expected behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a server class that manages tools and communication endpoints. It loads tools from configurations, registers their methods, and sets up SSE routes for main server and individual tools. Signal handling for termination is correctly implemented. SSE handlers properly manage connections, and no malicious data transmission or system manipulation is evident. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external communications are present. The code operates within typical server management patterns without obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a server that dynamically loads tools, registers their methods, and manages SSE communication channels. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks within this code segment. It follows expected patterns for such a server component.",
