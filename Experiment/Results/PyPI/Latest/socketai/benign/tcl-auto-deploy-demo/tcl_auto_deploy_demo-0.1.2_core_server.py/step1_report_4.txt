{
  "purpose": "The code defines a core server class for managing MCP (likely a custom protocol or system) with functionalities including tool loading, server initialization, signal handling, and creating a Starlette web application with SSE endpoints for communication.",
  "sources": "Settings loaded from 'settings' module, tool configurations, incoming requests to SSE endpoints, and potentially any loaded tools' methods.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'load_tool', 'add_tool' registration, request handling in SSE routes, and sys.exit() on signal.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from 'settings' into tool loading, then into tool registration. Incoming requests trigger SSE connection handlers which invoke server run methods. Signals can cause process termination.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or hidden backdoors detected. The code uses standard signal handling, logs, and structured server setup. No unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads configurations and tools, registers their methods with the MCP server, creates SSE endpoints for communication, and manages server lifecycle, including signal handling and cleanup. All data flows are related to server operation and tool management. The code employs standard libraries and patterns without evidence of malicious behavior. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are apparent. No obfuscated code or malicious code constructs identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate server core implementation for managing tools and SSE communication, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a structured server setup and management module, adhering to common practices without suspicious or harmful elements.",
