  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code content.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Purpose: Browser automation for deployment workflows (form filling, navigation, login, resource selection).\n- Inputs: Method parameters, environment variables, page content.\n- Outputs: Web interactions, navigation, form submissions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code observed.\n- Uses standard practices: retries, error handling, DOM querying.\n- No external network exfiltration or backdoors detected.\n- Credentials are managed via environment variables, not hardcoded.\n- No signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Conclusion: Well-structured, no malicious behavior, credentials handled securely, typical automation.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. The logic is standard for such automation scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Confidence: 0.95\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Conclusion: Similar to Report 1, no signs of malicious activity, credentials from config/env, standard practices.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Confidence: 0.95\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Conclusion: No malicious or sabotage behavior, credentials handled securely, typical web automation.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Confidence: 0.95\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior, safe and legitimate automation.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Conclusion: Standard automation, no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, well-structured automation framework.\n- No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or backdoors are detected.\n- Credentials are managed via environment variables, not hardcoded.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, sabotage, or malicious network activity.\n- The code's purpose aligns with legitimate deployment automation.\n\n### Scoring justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0.1-0.2), consistent with the reports, reflecting standard automation risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard automation risk)\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-implemented web automation tool for deployment workflows. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal. The provided reports are aligned with this assessment.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1-0.2\n\nand monitor for any external inputs or updates, but current analysis indicates no security concerns.",
