{
  "purpose": "This code implements a web automation framework for deployment workflows, including login, navigation, form filling, resource selection, and submission, primarily using Playwright.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters, environment variables for credentials, webpage content during interactions.",
  "sinks": "Web page DOM interactions, form submissions, navigation commands, resource selection dialogs.",
  "flows": "Inputs from parameters/env vars flow into form filling and navigation steps; webpage content influences login and error handling; resource selection and form submission are executed via DOM actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected. No suspicious network activity or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, standard web automation script utilizing Playwright. Credentials are managed via environment variables, not hardcoded. It performs typical DOM interactions, retries, and error handling. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or sabotage. The code is readable, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to logs potentially leaking sensitive info if not properly secured. Overall, the code aligns with legitimate automation practices and does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured automation framework with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or sabotage. The security risk is very low, and the malware score is justified as 0. The obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting standard automation risks.",
