{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up configuration for a server and tools, load environment variables, and define tools' parameters.",
  "sources": "Environment variables loaded via dotenv and os.getenv(), configuration data from hardcoded dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables used for sensitive credentials, potential logging outputs, and configurations used to initialize tools.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (API_QUERY_USER and API_QUERY_PASSWORD) flow into the 'deploy' tool configuration, potentially used for login credentials.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are directly embedded; credentials are sourced from environment variables. No suspicious code structures or obfuscated code detected. Logging of environment variable loading is benign.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables from a .env file and environment, uses them to populate sensitive configuration fields, and sets up server and logging configs. No code injection, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. Use of environment variables for credentials is standard practice, assuming proper handling outside of this script. No obfuscated code, no suspicious data leaks, and no malware behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs configuration setup for a server and tools, with environment variables used for credentials. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The usage of environment variables for sensitive data is typical and not inherently risky. Overall, the code appears safe.",
