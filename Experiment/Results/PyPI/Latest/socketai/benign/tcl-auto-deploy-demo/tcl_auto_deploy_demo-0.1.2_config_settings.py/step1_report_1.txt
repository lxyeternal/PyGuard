{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load configuration settings for a server and tools, including environment variables for credentials, and set up logging and tool configurations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (API_QUERY_USER, API_QUERY_PASSWORD), reading from a .env file, input from configuration dictionaries",
  "sinks": "Environment variables used for credentials; printing to console; potential use of loaded configuration data for tool operation",
  "flows": "Environment variables → settings.username/settings.password → TOOLS_CONFIG for authentication data",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for sensitive credentials is standard but should be handled carefully; no hardcoded secrets found. The print statements for environment loading are informational. No suspicious code behavior or backdoors identified. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads environment variables and configuration data, with proper fallbacks and warnings if the .env file is missing. Credentials are sourced from environment variables, avoiding hardcoding. There are no suspicious functions, backdoors, or malicious code behavior. The overall structure is standard for configuration management in Python. No indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The logging and configuration loading are safe and typical.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration script with proper environment variable handling for credentials. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious anomalies are evident. The use of environment variables for sensitive data is appropriate, though caution should be maintained in deployment environments. Overall, the code is safe from supply chain security risks based on the provided fragment.",
