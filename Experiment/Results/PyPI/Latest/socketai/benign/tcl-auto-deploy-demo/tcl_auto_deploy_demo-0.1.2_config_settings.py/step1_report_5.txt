  "purpose": "This code sets up configuration for a server and tools, loads environment variables, and defines tool parameters, including credentials.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.getenv() and the dotenv loaded from a .env file; input from the environment and configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Credentials (username and password) used in tool configuration; environment variables used to supply sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> settings.username/settings.password -> TOOLS_CONFIG['deploy'] configuration -> potential use in tools that may perform actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for credentials is common; no hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected. No suspicious or unusual code structures. The dotenv load and environment variable handling are standard.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables via dotenv, defines configuration objects, and sets up sensitive credentials through environment variables or settings. No malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is present. Usage of environment variables for credentials is typical, though care should be taken to ensure these are properly secured. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are identified. The code appears to perform standard configuration tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard configuration setup with environment variable handling for credentials. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a typical configuration script with no malicious intent.",
