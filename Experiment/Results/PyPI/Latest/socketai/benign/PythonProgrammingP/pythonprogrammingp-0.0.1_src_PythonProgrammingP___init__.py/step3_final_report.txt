  "purpose": "A simple Python script that outputs the string 'sea'.",
  "sources": "No external input, data, or environment variables; static code only.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; code performs a direct print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single static print statement with no external dependencies, inputs, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The assessments and scores are appropriate and justified given the code's straightforward nature.",
