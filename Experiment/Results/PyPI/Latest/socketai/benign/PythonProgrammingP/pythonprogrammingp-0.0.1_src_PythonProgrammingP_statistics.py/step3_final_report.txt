  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source dependency based on provided code analysis reports.",
  "sources": "No actual code provided; analysis based on descriptions and summaries.",
  "sinks": "No specific untrusted data sources identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no code execution paths analyzed.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or incomplete snippets; no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate either no code or benign, straightforward code with no suspicious features. Confidence levels vary from low (0.2) to high (1), reflecting the completeness of the information. Malware scores are uniformly zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and security risk scores are low (~0.2), indicating minimal concern. The assessments are reasonable given the lack of code or suspicious activity. No anomalies or malicious indicators are identified across reports.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks in the dependency. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the descriptions. The overall security posture is benign, and no adjustments are necessary.",
