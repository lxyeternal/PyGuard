  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no confirmed malicious activity; high obfuscation and suspicious patterns in one report warrant caution but are not definitive. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, suggesting low malware risk overall but emphasizing the need for further review if code becomes available."
