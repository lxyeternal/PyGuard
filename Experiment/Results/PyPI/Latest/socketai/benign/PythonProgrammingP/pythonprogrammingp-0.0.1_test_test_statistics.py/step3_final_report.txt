  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "No explicit code snippets provided; assessments based on descriptions of patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious behaviors.",
  "sinks": "Potential dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), obfuscated code segments, suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials or network calls.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly detailed; inferred source-to-sink paths involve dynamic code features and obfuscation patterns.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (score=0.8), suspicious dynamic patterns, potential complex structures, but no confirmed malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The reports uniformly acknowledge limited code visibility, leading to conservative scores. Report 4 stands out with high obfuscation and suspicion, justified by described patterns. Other reports maintain low malware and obfuscation scores consistent with their assessments. The scores reflect suspicion levels appropriately, with no evidence of actual malicious payloads. The confidence levels are moderate to high, given the limited code details. Overall, the scoring aligns with the described behaviors, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no confirmed malicious activity; high obfuscation and suspicious patterns in one report warrant caution but are not definitive. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, suggesting low malware risk overall but emphasizing the need for further review if code becomes available.",
