  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: a simple import statement importing `ChartMaker` from a local module `.core`.\n- There are no data flows, external communications, or dynamic code execution observed.\n- The code is straightforward and typical for modular Python projects.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are evident in the code snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The import statement is present in all reports, matching the original code.\n- **Malicious activity or anomalies:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify the code as non-obfuscated.\n- **Data flows:** No data flows or untrusted data handling are observed.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent from the code snippet itself.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n**Reports 1-4:**\n- All conclude the code is benign, with high confidence (0.9 to 1).\n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- Scores: malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- These assessments are consistent and reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.8).\n- Security risk score is 0.1, which might suggest a very minimal concern, but the reasoning indicates it's due to potential issues in the module or class itself, not the import statement.\n- Malware score remains 0.\n- The mention of \"no evidence of malicious behavior\" aligns with the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** All reports are consistent with the code snippet. The malware score should remain 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is just an import with no malicious activity, the security risk should be 0 or very close to it.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly identified as 0.\n- **Malware:** Correctly identified as 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk from this import statement)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly reflect this, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the analysis, I agree with the assessments provided. The code snippet is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
