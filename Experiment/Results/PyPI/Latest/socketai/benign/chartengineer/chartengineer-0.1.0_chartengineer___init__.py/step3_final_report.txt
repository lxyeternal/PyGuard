  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Import from .core to usage of ChartMaker (not shown in snippet)",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard import statement with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The import is typical in Python projects, and the code does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements. Given the minimal context, the risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and confidence in benign nature is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No modifications are necessary.",
