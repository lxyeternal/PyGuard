  "purpose": "Importing the ChartMaker class from a local module named core.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local module 'core'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leakage or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this single line; it only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a class from a relative module, which is common in Python projects. It does not involve any data input/output, network activity, or code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The only potential concern is if the 'core' module or the ChartMaker class itself contains malicious code, but based solely on this line, no malicious activity is detectable.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe based on this single line.",
