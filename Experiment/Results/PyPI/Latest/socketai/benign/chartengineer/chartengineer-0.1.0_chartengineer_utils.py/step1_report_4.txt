{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for data visualization and formatting, including color palette management, data value formatting, and percentage normalization for dataframes.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from pandas DataFrames passed into functions like to_percentage and normalize_to_percent.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the functions process and return dataframes or color lists without external data transmission or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrames into processing functions which perform groupby, summation, normalization, and formatting operations; outputs are processed DataFrames or color lists.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; no dynamic execution or suspicious external calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data processing functions that operate solely on pandas DataFrames, color palettes, and local computations. The color palette function combines multiple known palette sources without external inputs. The value formatting functions handle numeric data formatting with no code injection or malicious logic. The percentage functions perform standard grouping, summation, and normalization. No network access, file manipulation, or untrusted data execution present. Overall, the code appears to be standard utility functions with no malicious or maliciously intent behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of data formatting and visualization utility functions with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It strictly performs data processing, formatting, and color management tasks without external data transmission or security-sensitive operations.",
