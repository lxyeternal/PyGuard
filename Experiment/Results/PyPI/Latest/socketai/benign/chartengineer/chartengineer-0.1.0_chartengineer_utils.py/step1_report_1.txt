{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for data formatting, color palette generation, and data normalization primarily for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from pandas DataFrames passed into functions like to_percentage and normalize_to_percent. No external data sources are directly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed within pandas DataFrames and returned; no direct data leakage or external communication is present. No writing to files, network transmission, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame is copied and manipulated within functions; data flows from input DataFrame to processed DataFrame through groupby, calculation, and renaming operations. No external sink or leak points are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code structures are present. Usage of libraries like pandas, matplotlib, plotly, colorcet, and random is standard for visualization. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements data formatting (numeric and percentage formatting), color palette generation, and data normalization routines. Functions operate on DataFrames or generate color lists, with straightforward logic and no network or system-level calls. All functions are standard utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or unusual data handling observed. The use of print statements suggests debugging or logging, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for data visualization tasks, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any network communication, file writing, or secret extraction. Overall, it seems safe and benign.",
