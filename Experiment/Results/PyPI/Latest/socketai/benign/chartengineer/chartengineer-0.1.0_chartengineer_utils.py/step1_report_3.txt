{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for data visualization, formatting, and color palette generation, primarily for plotting and data analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from pandas DataFrames and some imported modules. There are no external data sources or untrusted input sources within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted strings, DataFrame modifications, and color lists. There are no data leaks, network connections, or system commands executed that could lead to data theft or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from DataFrame inputs through grouping, summing, and percentage calculations, then to formatted outputs or color palettes. No untrusted external data flows into security-critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard with no unusual or obfuscated logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Random module is imported but only used for shuffling color lists, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions for data formatting, color palette creation, and percentage calculations. It employs common libraries like pandas, matplotlib, plotly, and colorcet. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or system modifications are evident. The functions handle data processing and formatting tasks without any suspicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the use of random.shuffle, which is benign in context and does not pose security risks. Overall, there are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities within this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for data processing and visualization. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks detected. It functions as expected for its purpose without introducing security concerns.",
