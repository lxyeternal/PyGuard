{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for data formatting, color palette management, and data normalization, primarily used for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from pandas DataFrames, performs calculations, and generates color palettes. It also imports several libraries related to visualization and color schemes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. It only manipulates data within the application memory and generates color lists.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrames through grouping and summing operations into percentage and normalized values; color palettes are generated from multiple sources for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries and functions; no obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The script contains functions for cleaning numerical values into human-readable formats, generating color palettes from various sources, converting data to percentage representations, and normalizing data to percentages. The functions utilize standard libraries (pandas, matplotlib, plotly, colorcet) and perform straightforward calculations and data transformations. No network communication, file system manipulation, or system commands are present. All operations are within expected data processing routines with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for data visualization and formatting with no malicious behavior detected. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The overall security risk is negligible.",
