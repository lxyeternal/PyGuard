  "purpose": "Utility functions for data formatting, color palette generation, and normalization in data visualization tasks.",
  "sources": "Data inputs for functions like 'to_percentage' and 'normalize_to_percent', typically pandas DataFrames or Series, and color palette selections from libraries.",
  "sinks": "None; functions process data internally without external data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data is read from pandas DataFrames/Series, processed through formatting, grouping, and normalization functions, with color palettes generated from static library data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; print statements are for debugging purposes, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions performing data formatting, color palette creation, and normalization. It uses standard libraries without external communication or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected. The print statements are benign and typical for debugging. The functions operate on pandas DataFrames and Series, with clear logic and no security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility functions for data visualization and formatting, with no malicious intent or security issues. The existing scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and security risk should be at or near 0, considering the negligible risk from debugging print statements.",
