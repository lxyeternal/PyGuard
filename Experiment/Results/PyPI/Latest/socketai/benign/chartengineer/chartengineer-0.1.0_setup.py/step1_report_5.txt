{
  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'chartengineer' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The package sources are the list of dependencies in 'install_requires' and the code that reads 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous operations; primarily configuration data and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Dependencies are specified statically; 'long_description' reads from 'README.md' (trusted file). No runtime data flow or untrusted input handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, hidden code, or suspicious behavior detected. The 'url' field is empty but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input, network connections, or executable code execution occurs. The reading of 'README.md' is a common practice for long descriptions. The dependencies listed are common scientific and visualization libraries, with no indications of malicious intent. The 'url' field being empty is unusual but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. There are no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious data handling present.",
