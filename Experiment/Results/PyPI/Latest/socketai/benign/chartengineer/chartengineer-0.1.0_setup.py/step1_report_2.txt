  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'chartengineer' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads package dependencies from 'install_requires' list, reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "Installation process uses dependencies; reading files, but no untrusted data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads package dependencies and README file, processes them for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The 'url' field is set to a blank space ' ', which is unusual; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script for packaging. It specifies dependencies, author info, description, and metadata. The only unusual aspect is the empty URL string, which may indicate incomplete metadata. No suspicious code, obfuscated elements, or malicious behavior is present. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. Usage of dependencies is standard for a package related to chart building.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal, benign setup file for a Python package with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The empty URL field is likely an oversight rather than malicious intent.",
