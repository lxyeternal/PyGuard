  "purpose": "Configure the package setup for distribution of the 'chartengineer' Python library.",
  "sources": "N/A (configuration code, no runtime data reading)",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data sinks or external data processing during setup)",
  "flows": "N/A (static setup script, no runtime data flow)",
  "anomalies": "The 'url' field is an empty string, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution. The 'install_requires' lists dependencies from PyPI, all standard packages without any suspicious or malicious features. The 'url' field is empty, which is unusual but not malicious. The code reads a README.md file for the long description, which is standard. There are no runtime data inputs, no external connections, or malicious code elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
