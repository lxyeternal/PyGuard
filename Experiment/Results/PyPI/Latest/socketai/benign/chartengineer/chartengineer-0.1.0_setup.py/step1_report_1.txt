{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package called 'chartengineer', specifying dependencies, author info, and package details.",
  "sources": "N/A (no external input or data reading beyond static code and README file).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or environment variable usage within this code).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from sources to sinks present).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs detected. The setup script appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. No code executes untrusted commands, reads input dynamically, or contains obfuscated/misleading constructs. Dependencies listed are common scientific and visualization libraries, with no indications of malicious intent. The URL field is empty, which could be an oversight but not malicious. No signs of code injection, backdoors, or hidden behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package without malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious intent.",
