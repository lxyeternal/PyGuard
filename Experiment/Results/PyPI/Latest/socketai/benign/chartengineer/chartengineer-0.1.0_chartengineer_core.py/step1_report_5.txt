{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class 'ChartMaker' for creating, customizing, and saving various types of plots using Plotly, with features for annotations, titles, and handling different chart types such as pie, heatmap, line, and bar charts.",
  "sources": "Data sources include the input DataFrame 'df', user-provided options and axes data, and internal class state variables such as 'self.series' and 'self.df'. It reads data from 'df', options from parameters, and some module imports.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing images or HTML files to disk via 'self.fig.write_image' and 'self.fig.write_html', adding annotations and shapes to the plot, and printing diagnostic messages. The 'save_fig' method writes files to disk; 'add_annotations' and 'add_dashed_line' modify the figure; 'print' statements output diagnostic info.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'df' into plot elements; user options modify plotting behavior; 'save_fig' writes figure to disk; 'add_annotations' and 'add_dashed_line' insert annotations/shapes based on data; internal methods prepare and build plots with potential data transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns observed. The code performs standard plotting and file I/O operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden network connections are present. Print statements are used for diagnostics but are not malicious. No obfuscated code, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive plotting utility that handles multiple chart types, annotations, and file saving. It relies solely on data from provided DataFrame and options. The file I/O operations use safe methods (os.path.join, plotly's write_image/write_html). No network operations or suspicious data leaks are present. The print statements are for user diagnostics, not malicious exfiltration. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate visualization utility for generating and saving plots. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware indicators. It safely manages data and file output. No security risks or malicious intents are identified.",
