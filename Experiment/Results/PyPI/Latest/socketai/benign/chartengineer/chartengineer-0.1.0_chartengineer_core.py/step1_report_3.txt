{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python class for creating and customizing various types of charts using Plotly, with support for saving, displaying, and annotating figures.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from pandas DataFrames and potentially from external files for saving figures; some configuration options are taken from function arguments and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Data from DataFrames could be used in plotting, but there are no evident sinks that output untrusted data externally, such as network transmission or file writing of untrusted content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from DataFrame input into plotting functions, with optional normalization and customization parameters; data and options influence figure construction but no external data is transmitted or processed maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The code uses standard libraries (plotly, pandas, os) and functions for chart creation, layout, and annotations without hidden or malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily creates visualizations based on pandas DataFrame data, with functions for adding titles and annotations, saving figures, and handling different chart types. It performs data normalization, plotting, and layout adjustments in a typical manner. There are no network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The functions are consistent with chart generation workflows and do not exhibit malicious behavior. No evidence of code injection, privacy violations, or sabotage is observed. The code does include print statements for debugging but no dangerous commands or external malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard charting utility for data visualization with no malicious intent or behaviors. It is designed for generating and saving plots using open-source libraries without performing any harmful operations or data exfiltration.",
