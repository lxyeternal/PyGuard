The only minor security consideration involves validating user-supplied file paths to prevent directory traversal. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."

The existing scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and security risk should be at or near 0, considering the negligible risk from debugging print statements."
