  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script or module, but since no code is provided, the purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Input reading points are not visible due to missing code. Typical sources would include functions like input(), environment variables, or file reads, but none are explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network calls, file writes, system commands, or data transmissions, but no such actions are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable without actual code content.",
  "anomalies": "No code provided; therefore, no anomalies, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behaviors can be detected.",
  "analysis": "Without any code to analyze, it's impossible to identify sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies. The assessment is limited to the absence of visible code, making it impossible to evaluate security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to evaluate the code. Based on the absence of code, there are no detectable malicious behaviors or security issues. To perform a thorough review, please provide the actual code content.",
