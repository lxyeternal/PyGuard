{
  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential input points include environment variables, external network calls, dynamic code execution functions (eval, exec), and data parsing segments.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into network transmissions, file operations, or dynamic execution functions that could lead to data leaks, code injection, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or external inputs may flow into eval/exec or network modules, potentially leading to malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code segments, suspicious strings, use of eval/exec without clear necessity, inconsistent or suspicious dynamic behavior, and potential hidden network communications.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common tactics to evade detection. No explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, but suspicious patterns suggest potential malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0.3, obfuscated: 0.7, securityRisk: 0.55) are consistent with the observed behaviors. The lack of concrete malicious activity warrants a moderate malware suspicion, justified by obfuscation and dynamic code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and potential dynamic malicious behavior but lacks definitive payload evidence. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a moderate security risk. Further detailed analysis is recommended to confirm or refute malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "malware": 0.3,
