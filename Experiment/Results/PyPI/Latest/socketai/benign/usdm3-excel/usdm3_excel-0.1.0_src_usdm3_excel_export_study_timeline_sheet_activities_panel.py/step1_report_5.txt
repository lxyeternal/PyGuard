{
  "purpose": "The code generates a tabular collection of activities, timelines, and related details from a study object for export purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'study' object, specifically 'study.versions', 'version.studyDesigns', 'design.main_timeline()', and 'design.activity_list()'. It also accesses 'timepoint_list()' from the timeline object.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any sensitive operations such as network access, file writing, or handling untrusted user input that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the 'study' object to create a structured list of lists, representing a table. There are no external data sinks like network or file I/O; the data is simply returned as a Python list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses straightforward data access and list manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily accesses attributes and methods from the 'study' object and related classes. It constructs a data structure for export, with no user input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external communication. It relies on object properties and method calls, which appear standard and safe. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data processing routine with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply constructs a data table from provided objects for export purposes.",
