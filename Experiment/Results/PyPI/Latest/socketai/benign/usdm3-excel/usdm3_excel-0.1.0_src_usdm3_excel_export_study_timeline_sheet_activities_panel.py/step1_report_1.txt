  "purpose": "Generate a structured collection of activities and timepoints from study data for export.",
  "sources": "study.versions, version.studyDesigns, design.main_timeline(), design.activity_list()",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external communications.",
  "flows": "Study data -> study.versions -> version.studyDesigns -> design.main_timeline() and design.activity_list() -> collection output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code processes study data objects to generate a tabular collection. It retrieves study versions, designs, and timelines, then maps activities to timepoints. It constructs a report structure without any user input, external data fetching, or system modifications. No suspicious behaviors or security risks are evident. The code appears to be straightforward data manipulation, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a data transformation utility for study activities and timelines. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, does not handle untrusted input, and poses no security risks based on the provided code.",
