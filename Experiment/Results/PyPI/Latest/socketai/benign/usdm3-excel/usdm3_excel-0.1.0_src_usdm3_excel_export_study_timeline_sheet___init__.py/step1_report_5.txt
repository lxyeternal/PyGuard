  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a standard Python script, possibly intended for data processing or utility functions, without a clearly defined high-level purpose.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from variables or functions (specific sources not explicitly shown), possibly including environment variables or user inputs if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or file writes, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to processing functions or output functions; no clear malicious flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows standard Python structures with no signs of malicious behavior. The code does not perform network operations, file manipulations, or system modifications. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate, and there are no hidden or obfuscated segments. The code's purpose seems benign, with no indication of data exfiltration or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe Python script with no malicious or suspicious features.",
