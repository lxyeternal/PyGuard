  "purpose": "Define package and model version information as module-level constants.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only hardcoded version strings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code behavior. Simple variable assignments with version info.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets two string constants for package and model versions. No input handling, no data manipulation, no network operations, or security-sensitive actions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent. This appears to be standard metadata declaration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata for versioning purposes. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
