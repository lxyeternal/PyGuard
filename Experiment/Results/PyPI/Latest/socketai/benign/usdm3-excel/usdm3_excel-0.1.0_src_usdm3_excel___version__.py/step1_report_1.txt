  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only assigns string values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, containing only variable assignments with version strings; no suspicious or unusual code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple, consisting solely of two variable assignments indicating package and model versions. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks, and no complex flows. The code structure is straightforward and standard for version declaration. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are detected. The content does not suggest any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to define version variables for a package. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
