{
  "purpose": "The code serves as metadata, defining version strings for the package and model.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code only assigns static string values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two static variable assignments for versioning. There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. The code is simple, static, and serves as metadata. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign and minimal nature of the code. No logical flaws or suspicious activity are present. The code poses no threat and does not warrant any security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as version metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
