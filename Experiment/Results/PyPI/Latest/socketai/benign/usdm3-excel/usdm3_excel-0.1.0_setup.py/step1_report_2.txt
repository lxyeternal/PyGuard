  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'usdm3_excel', configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; reads and executes version info from '__version__.py'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data processing or external connections.",
  "flows": "Reads version info, then passes it into setuptools.setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute code from '__version__.py', which could be risky if the file contains malicious code. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a markdown file for description, then reads and executes a version file, which is a common pattern but poses some risk if the version file is maliciously altered. The setup() function configures package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers, with no dynamic code execution or network activity observed. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of exec() is the main concern, though it's a typical pattern for versioning in setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with minimal risk. The only potential security concern is the use of exec() to execute the contents of the version file, which could be exploited if that file is compromised. Otherwise, no malicious activity or supply chain attacks are evident.",
