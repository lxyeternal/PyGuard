{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package named 'usdm3_excel' by reading version info and description files, and configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading '__version__.py' for version info, and defining package requirements.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network or file writing, or sensitive data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (version info and README) into package metadata during setup; no external data flows or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'exec' to evaluate '__version__.py' is somewhat unusual but common in setup scripts; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files for package information, uses 'exec' to obtain version number, and configures package setup parameters. All operations are standard for Python package setup; no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected. The code does not interact with network, user input, or environment variables in an unsafe manner.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of 'exec' is standard for dynamic versioning but should be used cautiously. Overall, it appears safe and does not contain malware.",
