  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'usdm3_excel' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; reading '__version__.py' to retrieve package version.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing code from '__version__.py', which could potentially contain malicious code if the file is compromised.",
  "flows": "File read -> exec() on version file -> passing version info to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute code from a file containing version information; no validation or sanitization of the '__version__.py' content.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the README file for description and executes the content of '__version__.py' to retrieve version info. The use of exec() introduces potential security risks if the version file is tampered with, as it can execute arbitrary code. Otherwise, the setup configuration appears standard, with no suspicious dependencies or code. The package data, classifiers, and requirements are typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a notable security concern: the use of exec() to load version information from a file. If the version file is compromised, malicious code could be executed during package setup. Overall, the code does not contain malware or malicious behavior beyond this risk, but the exec() usage warrants attention.",
