  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'usdm3_excel', including reading version info and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; executing the content of 'src/usdm3_excel/__version__.py' to obtain version info.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Reading files (README.md, version file) and executing version file content to obtain package version.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to run the content of '__version__.py' without validation; this can be risky if the file contents are malicious or tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and reads the README.md file to include a long description. It then reads and executes the '__version__.py' file within a custom namespace to extract version info, which is used in the setup configuration. The use of 'exec' to evaluate the version file is potentially dangerous if the file is compromised, as it can execute arbitrary code. Otherwise, the setup appears standard for Python package configuration, with no hardcoded secrets, network operations, or other suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily standard setup code with a notable security concern due to the use of 'exec' to evaluate the version file. If the version file is secure and unaltered, the risk is low; otherwise, it could be exploited to execute malicious code during package setup.",
