{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'usdm3_excel', including reading metadata and defining package requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description; reading '__version__.py' for version information; no external input sources for execution.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; setup parameters are static or derived from local files.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> assign to long_description; read '__version__.py' -> execute code to set version; then pass collected data to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute code from '__version__.py' could be risky if the file contents are malicious, but this is a common pattern for dynamic versioning. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed. No obfuscation, malware, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading README for long description, dynamically loading version info via exec(), and configuring package metadata. The use of exec() is typical but could be exploited if the version file is tampered with. No other suspicious activity, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. No external data sources, network activity, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup script with a common use of exec() to load version info. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The main concern is ensuring the integrity of the '__version__.py' file, but this is typical in setup scripts.",
