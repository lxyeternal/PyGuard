  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward class that creates and formats an Excel sheet based on data retrieved via panel objects.\n- All reports agree that the code imports local modules and external dependencies, executes data retrieval methods, and writes to an Excel sheet.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified: no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- The operations are typical for report generation and data export.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Presence in the Code**\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude that there are no malicious behaviors, suspicious code, or anomalies. The code appears to be legitimate data processing logic.\n\n- **Confirmed?**  \n  Yes, based on the provided code snippet, no malicious or suspicious issues are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n- **Logical errors or flaws?**  \n  The reports are consistent; they correctly identify that the code performs standard data retrieval and formatting tasks. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n- **Misinterpretations?**  \n  No. The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Scores Review and Justification**\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Mostly low, with a few reports giving 0.1 or 0.2, citing minimal security risk. Given the code's nature, these are reasonable.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nThe scores seem appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Justification for Scores > 0.5**\n\n- **Any scores > 0.5?**  \n  No, all are well below 0.5.\n\n- **If higher?**  \n  Not applicable here; the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- The reports avoid assumptions; they focus on observed code behavior.\n- They correctly identify that the code does not perform network calls, dynamic code execution, or handle secrets.\n\n---\n\n### **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are 0, matching the conclusion of no malicious activity.\n- Slight variations in security risk (0.1–0.2) are acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment**\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — Code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Very low, just acknowledging that the code interacts with external modules and writes data, but nothing suspicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard report generation class with no security concerns. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The scores are appropriate, and no further adjustments are necessary.",
