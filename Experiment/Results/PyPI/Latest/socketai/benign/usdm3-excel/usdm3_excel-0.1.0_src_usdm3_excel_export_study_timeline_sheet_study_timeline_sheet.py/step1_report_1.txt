  "purpose": "Define a class to generate and format a 'mainTimeline' sheet in an Excel file based on study data.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.main_panel, .headings_panel, .activities_panel, usdm4.api.study, usdm4_excel.export.base.base_sheet) and method parameters (study object).",
  "sinks": "Methods that add tables and format cells in an Excel sheet, which could potentially process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Study object is passed to execute methods of panels, whose results are added to the Excel sheet. Data flows from study input through panels into the spreadsheet formatting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. No network or system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code imports local and external modules to generate an Excel sheet with study data. It creates panel objects, executes them with a Study object, and writes the results into an Excel sheet with formatting. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. The operations seem to be straightforward data processing and formatting. No anomalies or indicators of malicious code, such as hidden backdoors or malicious data handling, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate data export utility for studies, formatting and populating an Excel sheet. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It processes input data through panels and writes to a spreadsheet without executing untrusted code or performing harmful actions.",
