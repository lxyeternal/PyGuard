  "purpose": "Generate and format a 'mainTimeline' sheet with data retrieved from panel objects related to a Study.",
  "sources": "execute() methods of MainPanel, HeadingsPanel, ActivitiesPanel; data passed to add_table() and format_cells()",
  "sinks": "add_table() writes data to Excel; format_cells() applies formatting; set_column_width() adjusts columns",
  "flows": "execute() methods -> add_table() -> format_cells() -> set_column_width()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports local modules, creates panel objects, executes data retrieval, writes results into an Excel sheet, and applies formatting. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated patterns are present. The operations are standard for report generation. The data flow is straightforward, with no suspicious anomalies. The code's simplicity and lack of external network activity suggest a benign utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard report generation class with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs data retrieval and formatting for Excel sheets safely. The security and malware scores are appropriately low, and the code is not obfuscated. Overall, it is safe and trustworthy.",
