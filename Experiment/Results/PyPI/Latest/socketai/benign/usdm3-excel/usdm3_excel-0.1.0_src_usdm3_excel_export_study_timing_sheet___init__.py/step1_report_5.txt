  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is not explicitly clear from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input functions or data reading points are not explicitly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network communication, file writes, or database interactions if present elsewhere, but none are evident in the visible code.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are identifiable within the visible code; further context would be needed to determine data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs in the visible code. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks direct indicators of malicious intent. It does not contain hardcoded credentials, unusual function calls, or network operations. The absence of input/output handling makes it difficult to identify any malicious data flow. Without additional context or code segments, no suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign but incomplete, limiting full assessment.",
