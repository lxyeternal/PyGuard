  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data, or dynamic code; the setup script itself is static.",
  "sinks": "The entry point 'advancedchatbot.main:run_chatbot' may execute runtime code, but not within this script.",
  "flows": "The setup defines an entry point that, when invoked, runs 'run_chatbot' from the 'advancedchatbot.main' module; no malicious flow present in this static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in the setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with no dynamic inputs, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. It specifies package metadata and a console script entry point. The actual behavior depends on the implementation of 'run_chatbot', which is outside this code. No signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk near 0) are accurate and appropriate given the static nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious patterns. The potential runtime risks depend on the implementation of 'run_chatbot', but the static setup code itself poses no security threat.",
