  "purpose": "Define the version string of a Python package or module",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow concerns",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as only a variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious activity; very minimal code",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to a variable named __version__. This is a common practice in Python packages to specify version information. No input/output, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present. No potential security issues are identifiable from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign assignment of a version string with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
