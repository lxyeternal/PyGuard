  "purpose": "Declare the version of the Python package",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment of __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple, straightforward code",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, a common pattern in Python packages. It contains no input, output, data processing, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. The analysis is thorough and aligns with best practices for such minimal code snippets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, representing a standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The current assessments and scores are accurate and require no modification.",
