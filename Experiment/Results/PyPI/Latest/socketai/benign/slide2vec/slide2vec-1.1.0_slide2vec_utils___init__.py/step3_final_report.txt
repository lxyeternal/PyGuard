  "purpose": "Import statements for utility functions and logging setup, likely part of a larger application or pipeline.",
  "sources": "Local modules: .utils and .log_utils",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Import statements do not involve data flow; no source-to-sink pathways",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with function names indicating standard utility roles. No code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs here. The import statements are straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. Given the absence of dynamic code, external data, or network operations, the snippet appears benign. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with high confidence, and assign zero malware and security risk scores. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of import statements from local utility modules, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
