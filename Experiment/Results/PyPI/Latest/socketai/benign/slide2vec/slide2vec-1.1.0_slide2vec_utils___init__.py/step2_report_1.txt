  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims made, the scoring, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of import statements from local modules (.utils and .log_utils).\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present within this snippet.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The functions imported have names indicating standard utility roles in ML or data processing workflows.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Verifications:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present?**  \nYes. All reports correctly state that the code only contains import statements, with no malicious activity or security risks visible here.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \nNo. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to issues:**  \n- `malware`: all are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- `obfuscated`: all are 0, matching the clarity of the code.\n- `securityRisk`: all are 0, consistent with the absence of security concerns.\n\nNo adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Risk and Malware Scores Justification:\n\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, which is justified. Import statements alone do not pose security risks unless they are part of a malicious payload, which is not indicated here.\n- **Malware Score:** All are 0, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n### Potential Malicious Behavior or Assumptions:\n\n- No claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions are made in these reports, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven the code snippet and the context provided, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign and standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The reports are accurate.\n- **Security implications:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate as given; no changes needed.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \nThis code snippet is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If future code snippets include actual implementation, data handling, or network activity, reassessment would be necessary.",
