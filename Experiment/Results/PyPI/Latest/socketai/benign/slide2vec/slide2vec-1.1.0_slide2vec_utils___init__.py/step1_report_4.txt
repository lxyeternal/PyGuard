  "purpose": "Import statements for utility functions and logging setup, likely for a larger machine learning or data processing project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.utils and .log_utils). No data reading or external input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted data are present in these lines.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident from the given code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior are present in these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, which are standard for modular Python code organization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks are involved, and the functions imported appear to be utility functions typical for project setup and management.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code segment contains only benign import statements with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
