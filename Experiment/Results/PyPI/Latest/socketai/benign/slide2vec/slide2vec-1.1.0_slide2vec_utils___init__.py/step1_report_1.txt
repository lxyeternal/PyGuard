{
  "purpose": "This code imports utility functions likely used for initializing experiment tracking, fixing randomness, obtaining version control information, loading data, updating model states, and setting up logging.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from local modules (.utils and .log_utils). No external data sources or inputs are read directly in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or sensitive data leaks are evident within these import statements alone.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible from import statements alone; no execution or data processing occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "All functions imported appear to be standard utility functions; no unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules. The functions' names suggest typical utility roles in a machine learning or data processing pipeline. There are no code execution, network activity, or data manipulation within these lines. Without implementation details, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, consisting only of imports of utility functions. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are identifiable at this stage.",
