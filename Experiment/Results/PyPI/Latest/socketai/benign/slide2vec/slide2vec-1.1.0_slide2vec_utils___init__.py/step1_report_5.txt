  "purpose": "Import utility functions and logging setup for a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions from local modules (.utils and .log_utils).",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data handling or external data sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable here as only imports are shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of import statements with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions related to initialization, randomness fixing, hashing, CSV loading, state updating, and logging setup. All imports are from local modules, and none of the functions suggest malicious intent or unusual behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or suspicious code structures. The snippet is straightforward and appears to be part of a standard setup process.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical import statement section for a Python project, with no evidence of malicious activity, malicious code, or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
