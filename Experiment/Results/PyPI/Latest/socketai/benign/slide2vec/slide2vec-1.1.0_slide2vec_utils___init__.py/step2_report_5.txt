  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Each Report:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local utility modules (.utils and .log_utils).\n- They consistently conclude that there are no anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or security risks.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), indicating the reviewers are quite certain these snippets are benign.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, with no indication of malicious intent.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the conclusion that these are standard setup imports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?**  \n  No. The code only contains import statements for utility functions, which are common in many projects.\n\n- **Are the imported functions suspicious?**  \n  No. Their names suggest typical utility roles: initializing experiments, fixing randomness, getting SHA, loading CSVs, updating states, and setting up logging.\n\n- **Are there any anomalies or suspicious patterns?**  \n  No. All reports explicitly mention the absence of anomalies, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns.\n\n- **Are the scores consistent?**  \n  Yes. Malware scores are all 0, reflecting no malicious activity. Risk scores are 0, indicating no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors?**  \n  Based solely on import statements, there is no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious code. Import statements are benign unless the imported modules themselves are malicious, which is outside the scope of these snippets.\n\n- **Are the reports overestimating or underestimating risk?**  \n  They are appropriately cautious, assigning zero malware and security risk scores, consistent with the evidence.\n\n- **Are the scores appropriate given the context?**  \n  Yes. The high confidence levels and zero malware/risk scores align with the benign nature of these snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward, no obfuscation).\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified).\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the provided scores. The code snippets are standard import statements with no signs of malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** These code snippets are safe, benign, and typical for project setup. No further action needed.",
