  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed; import statements are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions related to initialization, random seed fixing, SHA retrieval, CSV loading, state updating, and logging setup. All imported functions seem aligned with typical application or machine learning workflows. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The snippet does not perform any data processing or network activity itself, only imports.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be a standard import section for a larger codebase, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not include any risky or malicious code actions.",
