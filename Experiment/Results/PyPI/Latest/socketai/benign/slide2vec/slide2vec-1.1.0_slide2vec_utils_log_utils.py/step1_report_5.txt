    "Writing logs to a file or stream which could contain sensitive information if logs include sensitive data",
    "Appending process-specific suffixes to filenames that could potentially cause log overwriting or confusion"

  "flows": [
    "Logger configuration data flows from setup_logging to _configure_logger",
    "Log messages are formatted and sent to handlers, which write to stdout or log files"
  ],
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. Use of standard libraries and patterns for logging configuration. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to configure and set up logging with options for console and file handlers. It uses standard libraries such as logging, os, sys, and a distributed module. File handlers are created with dynamic filenames based on input parameters and process rank, which is typical in distributed training setups. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a straightforward logging setup with no hidden or malicious intentions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup routine with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It uses typical patterns for logging configuration in multi-process environments.",
