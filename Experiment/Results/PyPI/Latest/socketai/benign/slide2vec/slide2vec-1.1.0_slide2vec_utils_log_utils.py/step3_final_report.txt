  "purpose": "Configure logging for distributed Python applications, supporting console and file handlers with dynamic filename handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'output' used to determine log file location and name.",
  "sinks": "File handler writes logs to specified filename; potential for directory traversal if 'output' is maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Input 'output' influences filename; logger writes logs to stdout and file based on process role and 'output' parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code or obfuscation; potential filename manipulation if 'output' is externally controlled without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging with process-aware handlers, creating directories as needed. It supports dynamic filenames, which could be exploited if 'output' is manipulated maliciously, leading to directory traversal or log hijacking. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is standard and well-structured, with no evident security flaws aside from the filename handling concern. The risk score of 0.2 is justified given the potential for misuse, but no active malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe logging setup supporting distributed environments. No malware or obfuscation detected. The minor security risk relates to filename manipulation if 'output' is untrusted, but this is a common pattern and not malicious. The overall security assessment remains low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a small risk score (~0.2) justified by potential filename exploitation.",
