{
  "purpose": "The code processes Whole Slide Images (WSI) to extract tile coordinates, visualize them, and manage the pipeline's progress, including error handling and resumption.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files, CSV files listing WSI and mask paths, environment variables (e.g., SLURM), and input image/mask files.",
  "sinks": "Writes coordinate arrays (.npy), visualization images (.jpg), and logs to CSV files; no network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs from config, CSVs, environment variables → processing functions (extract_coordinates, save_coordinates, visualize_coordinates) → outputs to disk and logs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected. Use of environment variables like SLURM is standard in HPC environments.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard, well-structured image processing pipeline for slide data, utilizing multiprocessing, error handling, and resumption logic. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code relies on common libraries and practices, with environment variables used appropriately. No network activity or suspicious code patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate slide image processing pipeline with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
