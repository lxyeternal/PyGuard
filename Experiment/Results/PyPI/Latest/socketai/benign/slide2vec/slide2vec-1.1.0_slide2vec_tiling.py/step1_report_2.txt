{
  "purpose": "The code processes whole slide images (WSI) to extract tile coordinates, visualize, and save the processed data, primarily for image analysis workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input file paths (WIS and masks) from CSV files, command-line arguments, and configuration files. Also loads and reads coordinate data from .npy files.",
  "sinks": "Saves coordinate data as .npy files, creates visualizations (JPG images), writes CSV logs, and manages directories for output.",
  "flows": "Input paths are read from CSVs and configuration files, processed via extract_coordinates(), results are saved as .npy files and visual images, progress and status are logged in CSV files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or hidden backdoors observed. The code utilizes standard libraries and functions without suspicious dynamic code execution. No obfuscation or misleading variable names detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical processing pipeline for image data, involving loading configurations, parallel processing, and saving outputs. It manages process states via CSV logs and performs visualization if enabled. No code segments indicate malicious intent such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or hidden backdoors. Usage of standard libraries and functions aligns with legitimate workflows. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate image processing pipeline with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely handles file paths and data, without hardcoded secrets or unsafe operations. It is considered safe based on the provided code.",
