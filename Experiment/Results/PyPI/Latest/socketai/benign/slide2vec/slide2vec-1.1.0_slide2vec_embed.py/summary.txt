  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured distributed feature extraction pipeline with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are justified. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) reflects minimal operational concerns but no active threats. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use."
