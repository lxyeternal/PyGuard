  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.md' and passes static metadata to setup(); no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that reads a local README file and invokes setuptools.setup() with project metadata. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or user input handling. No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
