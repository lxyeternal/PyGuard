  "purpose": "Setuptools-based script for package setup and metadata definition",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks",
  "flows": "File reading from 'README.md' to 'long_description' used in package setup",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors; standard setup script",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and reads a README file for package description, then invokes 'setuptools.setup' with package metadata including author email, URL, project URLs, and package discovery settings. The code appears to be a standard setup script without obfuscated elements or malicious logic. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or other malicious activities. All data sources are safe and used in a typical manner for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious behavior detected. It performs package configuration and metadata reading in a conventional manner.",
