  "purpose": "Simple mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters a and b.",
  "sinks": "Results are returned directly; no external sinks are used.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (a, b) flow into functions; results are returned directly without external processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines basic arithmetic functions with clear and straightforward logic. The division function includes a check for division by zero, raising an error as expected. No external data sources, network operations, or data leaks are present. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors identified. The functions are simple and serve standard mathematical purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of basic arithmetic operations. No malware, suspicious behaviors, or security risks detected. It is safe for use.",
