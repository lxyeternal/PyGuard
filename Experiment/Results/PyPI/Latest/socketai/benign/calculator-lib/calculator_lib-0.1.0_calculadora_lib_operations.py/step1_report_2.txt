{
  "purpose": "The code implements basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "sources": "Function arguments `a` and `b` for each operation, which are inputs to the functions.",
  "sinks": "The return statements of each function where the result is produced; particularly the division function which raises an exception if `b` is zero.",
  "flows": "Input arguments `a` and `b` flow into the arithmetic operations, with the division function checking for zero and raising an exception if necessary. No external or untrusted data sources or network communications are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, and no obfuscated code. The code follows standard arithmetic operations with proper input validation for division by zero.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple arithmetic functions with clear documentation. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, backdoors, or obfuscated logic, are present. The division function includes input validation to prevent division by zero, which is a standard safety check. Overall, the code appears straightforward, with no suspicious constructs or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic mathematical calculations with appropriate safety checks. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe for use in standard applications.",
