  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward, implementing basic arithmetic functions with proper input validation for division by zero.\n   - No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The functions are simple, well-documented, and do not contain malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are present in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or 0.5, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely arithmetic with no external interactions or suspicious patterns, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, nor does it contain obfuscation or malware.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n   - No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or harmful behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on observable code patterns.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are evident.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all indicate no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risks.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall Justification:**\nThe code is a simple, standard utility module for arithmetic operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The detailed reviews support this conclusion.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No changes necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.",
