  "purpose": "Implementation of basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "sources": "Function arguments 'a' and 'b' for each operation; division function checks for zero denominator.",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting the result; division raises exception on zero denominator.",
  "flows": "Input arguments 'a' and 'b' flow into arithmetic operations; division flow includes zero check before division.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with proper validation in division.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple arithmetic functions with appropriate handling of division by zero. No external data sources, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The functions are well-documented and follow standard practices. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed. The code's structure and logic are clear, with no anomalies or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, safe, and performs basic arithmetic operations correctly. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
