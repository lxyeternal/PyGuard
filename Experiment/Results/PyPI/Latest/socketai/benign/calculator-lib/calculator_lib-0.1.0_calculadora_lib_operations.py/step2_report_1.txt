  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of basic arithmetic functions.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- Proper handling of division by zero.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code matches the description; no issues or anomalies are present.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No, the code is standard and safe.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Scores for malware and obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Flow and sink analysis:** Correctly identified as straightforward data flow.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n- The **malware score** is correctly 0 across all reports; no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, which is appropriate.\n- The **security risk score** is 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n### Justification:\n- Since the code performs only basic arithmetic operations, with proper input validation for division, and no external data or network activity, there is no basis for higher risk scores.\n- The reports' conclusions are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
