{
  "purpose": "The code provides basic arithmetic functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via function arguments `a` and `b` for each arithmetic operation.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; the functions simply perform arithmetic operations.",
  "flows": "Input arguments `a` and `b` are passed directly into arithmetic operations with no external or network data involved; the flow is straightforward and internal.",
  "anomalies": "The code is simple and well-structured, with no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The division function correctly handles division by zero.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of four basic arithmetic functions, each taking two float inputs and returning a float result. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code patterns. The division function properly raises an exception on division by zero. Overall, the code appears to be a standard utility module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward arithmetic utility without malicious behavior or security issues. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. It is safe from a security perspective.",
