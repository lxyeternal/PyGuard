{
  "purpose": "Provides basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "sources": "Function inputs (a, b) for each operation.",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting the result; division function raises exception on division by zero.",
  "flows": "Input variables (a, b) flow into each arithmetic operation, with division potentially raising an exception if b == 0.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual constructs, and no suspicious network or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward arithmetic functions with input parameters and simple return statements. The division function includes an explicit check for division by zero, raising an exception appropriately. There are no sources or sinks that involve untrusted external data, no data leaks, or security-sensitive operations. The code is clean, simple, and conventional, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic arithmetic operations without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard utility functions with no suspicious behavior.",
