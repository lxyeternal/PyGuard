{
  "purpose": "Provides basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).",
  "sources": "Input parameters `a` and `b` in each function, especially the `divide` function where `b` is checked for zero.",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting the computation results; in `divide`, raising an exception for division by zero.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into arithmetic operations, with a check for zero in `divide`, then output the result or raise an error.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution. Code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four basic arithmetic functions with appropriate input validation for division by zero. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code does not read or write external data sources, nor does it perform any network activity or system modifications. It is simple, standard mathematical operations without hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of basic arithmetic functions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It contains no anomalies or obfuscation, and the logic is clear and safe.",
