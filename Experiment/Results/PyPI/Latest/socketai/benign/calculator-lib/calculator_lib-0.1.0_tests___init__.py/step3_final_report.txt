  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), network activity, encoded strings.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, system commands, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and input data flow into eval/exec, network communication, or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscated strings, encoded data, complex control flow, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network endpoints.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, particularly in Report 4, indicating high malicious potential. Reports 2 and 4 show patterns consistent with data exfiltration or covert communication, justifying higher malware and obfuscation scores. Reports 1, 3, and 5 lack suspicious patterns, with minimal or no code, leading to low scores. The scores are internally consistent with the described behaviors and indicators. Slight adjustments to Report 2's scores (obfuscated and malware to 0.5) reflect the suspicion level. Overall, the assessments align with the evidence, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code in Reports 1 and 3 appears benign with low risk. Reports 2 and 4 demonstrate obfuscation and dynamic behaviors indicative of malicious intent, warranting higher scores. Report 5 has no code and is low risk. The scoring and reasoning are consistent and justified based on the provided descriptions.",
