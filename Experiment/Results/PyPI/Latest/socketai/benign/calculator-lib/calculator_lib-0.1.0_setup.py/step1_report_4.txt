{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library called 'calculator_lib' that provides basic mathematical operations.",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'setuptools' module and the 'find_packages()' function.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script solely calls setup functions with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets (beyond standard metadata), or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls 'setup()' with static, descriptive parameters for package configuration. It uses 'find_packages()' to include all sub-packages. The script appears to be a standard Python package setup file, with no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
