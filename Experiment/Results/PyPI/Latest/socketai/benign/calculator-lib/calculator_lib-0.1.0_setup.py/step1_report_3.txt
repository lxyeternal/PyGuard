{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'calculator_lib' containing basic mathematical operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the setup() function parameters such as package metadata, and the find_packages() function to identify packages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is static setup configuration without data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard setup script. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and uses setup() to configure package metadata, including name, version, description, author info, and package discovery. All components are standard for Python package distribution. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious patterns are present. The find_packages() call correctly identifies package modules. The code contains no external data handling or execution logic that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a benign package configuration file.",
