{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package named 'calculator_lib' with basic metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata and uses find_packages() to discover sub-packages.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is straightforward package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata. It imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools and calls setup() with fixed arguments, including package name, version, description, author details, and package discovery. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no code execution beyond the standard setup process, and no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
