  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script defining package metadata for 'calculator_lib'.",
  "sources": "Static strings for package name, version, description, author, author_email; uses find_packages() for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external data fetching, or code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static metadata and package discovery via find_packages(). It contains no dynamic code, external data fetching, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors present. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is unnecessary given the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate; minor adjustment to security risk score in one report to 0 is recommended for consistency.",
