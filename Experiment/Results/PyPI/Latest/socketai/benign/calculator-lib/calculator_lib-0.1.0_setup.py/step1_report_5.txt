{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'calculator_lib' Python package, including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Constants and function calls: package metadata (name, version, description, author, author_email), find_packages() for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard setuptools setup pattern with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata such as name, version, description, author info, and package list. The description is in Spanish, indicating localization but no malicious content. The use of find_packages() is standard for package discovery. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or secret handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and follows typical packaging conventions. No security risks identified.",
