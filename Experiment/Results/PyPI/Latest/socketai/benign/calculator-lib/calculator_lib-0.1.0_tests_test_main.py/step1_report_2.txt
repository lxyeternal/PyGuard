{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test functions for a FastAPI application, verifying basic arithmetic endpoints.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (via os.path and sys.path), and data from JSON payloads sent in POST requests.",
  "sinks": "The POST requests send JSON data to API endpoints; no untrusted data directly influences system state beyond the API call.",
  "flows": "Input data from test functions flows into API endpoints; responses are checked for correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code simply tests API endpoints.",
  "analysis": "The code imports test modules, sets up a test client, and defines multiple test functions that send arithmetic operation requests to the API. The code adds the parent directory to sys.path, which is standard for test setup and not suspicious. No data leaks, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The only input is JSON data for API requests, which is typical in testing scenarios. No external or malicious network activity or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for API endpoints with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs standard unit testing procedures without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
