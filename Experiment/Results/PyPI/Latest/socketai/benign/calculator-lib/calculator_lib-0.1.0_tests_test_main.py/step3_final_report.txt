{
  "purpose": "This code is a set of unit tests for a FastAPI calculator API, verifying basic arithmetic endpoints with fixed JSON payloads.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded JSON payloads within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or untrusted data processing; responses are validated locally.",
  "flows": "Input data flows directly into API endpoints; responses are checked for correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors; sys.path modification is standard in test setups.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, employing standard testing practices without dynamic or external data sources. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The sys.path modification is typical for test environments and does not introduce risk. The test inputs are fixed, and responses are validated locally, indicating benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for API endpoints with no malicious or security concerns. The minimal sys.path modification is common and not risky in this context. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward testing setup.",
