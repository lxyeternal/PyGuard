  "purpose": "Test suite for FastAPI calculator endpoints",
  "sources": "Reading test inputs from hardcoded JSON payloads in test functions",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "Input data in test POST requests flows directly into API endpoints with no harmful side effects",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The sys.path modification is a common testing practice, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing modules and app code, sets up a test client, and defines several test functions for API endpoints. The JSON payloads are hardcoded for test purposes. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. The sys.path.append call is standard for test setups. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be a straightforward test suite.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for API endpoints with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
