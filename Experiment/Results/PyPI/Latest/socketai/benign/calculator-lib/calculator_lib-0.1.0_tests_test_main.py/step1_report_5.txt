{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for a FastAPI application, verifying the correctness of arithmetic operation endpoints.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from test functions via HTTP POST requests with JSON payloads. It also accesses the filesystem to modify sys.path.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe if user input were used unsafely in sensitive operations, but in this context, data is used solely for testing endpoints. No direct data leaks or dangerous operations observed.",
  "flows": "Input data from test functions flows into API endpoints, which process the data and return results. No external or untrusted data flows into critical system functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The sys.path modification appears standard for test setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for a FastAPI application, importing the app and testing various arithmetic endpoints. It uses TestClient to simulate HTTP requests with JSON data. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious data handling. The sys.path modification is typical for testing scenarios to ensure the app module is accessible. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. Overall, the code is benign and functions solely for testing the API endpoints.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for API endpoint validation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely performs local testing of arithmetic operations and modifies sys.path for test setup purposes.",
