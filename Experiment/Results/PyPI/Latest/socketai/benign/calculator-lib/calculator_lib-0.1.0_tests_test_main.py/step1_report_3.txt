  "purpose": "The code defines test cases for API endpoints in a FastAPI application, verifying arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"..\"))) modifies sys.path; client.post calls to API endpoints; importing TestClient and app.",
  "sinks": "Response assertions verify output, no external sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "TestClient sends POST requests to endpoints; responses are checked for correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual or malicious patterns. The sys.path modification is typical for testing setups.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary testing modules and app components, sets up a test client, and defines test functions for various arithmetic endpoints. The sys.path modification adjusts module search paths for testing. The test functions send specific JSON payloads to endpoints and verify response status codes and output. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be standard test code for a web API.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of API endpoint tests with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs straightforward functional testing without any malicious or suspicious actions.",
