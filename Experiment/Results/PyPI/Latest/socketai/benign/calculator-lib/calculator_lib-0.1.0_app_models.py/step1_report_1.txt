  "purpose": "Defines data models for mathematical operation requests and responses using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only declares models.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions using Pydantic's BaseModel to structure request and response data. There are descriptive docstrings, and no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or potentially malicious constructs are present. The code appears straightforward and solely serves data validation and modeling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign data model definition with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
