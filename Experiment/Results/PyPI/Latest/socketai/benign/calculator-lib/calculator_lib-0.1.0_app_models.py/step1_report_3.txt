  "purpose": "Define data models for mathematical operation requests and responses using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "The class definitions and attribute declarations within the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform any actions based on input.",
  "flows": "The code only defines data structures; no data flow or processing logic is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Pydantic's BaseModel to define two data models: OperationRequest and OperationResponse. These models specify expected input/output formats for mathematical operations, with attributes 'a', 'b', and 'result' as floats. There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, or suspicious patterns. The docstrings are in Portuguese but serve as documentation and do not introduce security risks. Overall, the code is simple, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, standard implementation of data models for mathematical operations, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
