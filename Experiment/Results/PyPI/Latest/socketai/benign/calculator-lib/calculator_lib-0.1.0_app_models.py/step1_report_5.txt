  "purpose": "Define data models for operation requests and responses using Pydantic for a mathematical operation API.",
  "sources": "Import from pydantic; class definitions and annotations for 'a', 'b', and 'result'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external system calls or data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input models ('OperationRequest') to application logic (not shown), then results are stored in 'OperationResponse'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are detected. Code consists of standard data model definitions with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines two Pydantic models with type annotations and docstrings, without any dynamic execution, external calls, or hidden code. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation are present. It appears to be straightforward data modeling code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and only sets up data models for a mathematical operation API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
