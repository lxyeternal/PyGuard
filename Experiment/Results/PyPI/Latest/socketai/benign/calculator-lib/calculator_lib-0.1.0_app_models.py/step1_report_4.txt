  "purpose": "Define data models for mathematical operation requests and responses using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "No input sources; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output points; purely data model definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; models are used for validation and serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code; no obfuscated or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines two Pydantic models with clear docstrings. No external data input, no data manipulation, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The models are straightforward data containers for mathematical operation requests and responses, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, safe definition of data models with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities.",
