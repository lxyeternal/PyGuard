{
  "purpose": "Define data models for mathematical operation requests and responses using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions and type annotations for input validation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to model validation within the application; no external data flow or network interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code is straightforward data modeling with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Pydantic's BaseModel to define two simple data classes: OperationRequest and OperationResponse. Both classes contain only attributes with type annotations. No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is typical for API data validation schemas, with well-documented attributes. It appears to be a standard implementation without any hidden or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a data schema for handling mathematical operation requests and responses. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is simple, clear, and safe.",
