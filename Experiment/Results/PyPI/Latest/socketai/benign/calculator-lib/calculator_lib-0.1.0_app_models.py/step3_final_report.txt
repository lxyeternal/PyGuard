  "purpose": "Define data schemas for mathematical operation requests and responses in an API.",
  "sources": "None; static class attribute definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "None; the code only declares data models without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-documented, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two Pydantic models: OperationRequest with float attributes a and b, and OperationResponse with float attribute result. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data sources, network calls, or code execution. The code is static, simple, and serves as data validation schemas. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No adjustments are necessary as the code is a standard, safe implementation of data models for API handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, containing only data model definitions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
