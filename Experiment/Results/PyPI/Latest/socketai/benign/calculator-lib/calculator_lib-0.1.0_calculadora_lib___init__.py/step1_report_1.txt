{
  "purpose": "The code imports basic mathematical operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) from a local module named 'operations'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads the 'operations' module and its functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this snippet; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or untrusted data passing through; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a relative module. It does not include any input handling, data processing, or potentially malicious constructs. The imported functions are typical for a math operations module, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. Given its minimal and standard nature, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, simply importing standard mathematical functions from a local module. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
