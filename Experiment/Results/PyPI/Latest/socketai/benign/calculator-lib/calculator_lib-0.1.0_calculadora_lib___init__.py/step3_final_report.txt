  "purpose": "Import functions add, subtract, multiply, divide from local operations module",
  "sources": "The import statement from .operations module",
  "sinks": "None; no data or untrusted input processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "N/A; only static import, no data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of four functions from a local module named 'operations'. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The minimal nature and standard syntax suggest benign intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign maximum confidence, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores at zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
