{
  "purpose": "Importing basic arithmetic functions from a local module named 'operations'.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .operations suggests reading code from a local or packaged module within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; simple import statement with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement bringing in four functions—add, subtract, multiply, divide—from a local module. It does not process any input data, perform network operations, or execute code dynamically. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The code appears to serve a basic utility purpose within a larger package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import operation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
