{
  "purpose": "Importing basic arithmetic functions from a local module named 'operations'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'operations' within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only imports occur.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports four functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) from a local module. There is no user input, data processing, network communication, or other operations that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or anomalies are present. The import statement is standard Python practice for modular code organization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a simple import of arithmetic functions, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
