  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement: `from .operations import add, subtract, multiply, divide`.\n   - There are no signs of data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and straightforward, with no anomalies or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - No errors or logical flaws are identified across the reports.\n   - The code appears correct and idiomatic for a Python package importing local functions.\n\n3. **Scores Review**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1.0\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis: the code is benign, with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.\n\n4. **Assessment of Malicious Potential and Risks**:\n   - Since the code only imports functions, there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - The security risk score of 0 aligns with the benign nature.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions and Claims**:\n   - The reports correctly dismiss any suspicion of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - Given the simplicity, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n7. **Final Expert Evaluation**:\n   - The code snippet is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.\n   - The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign import statement with no security issues. The current scoring accurately reflects its safety profile.",
