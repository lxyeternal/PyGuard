  "purpose": "Import mathematical operation functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from a local module named 'operations'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; only import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports four functions from a local module. There are no user inputs, external data reads, or sensitive information handling. No suspicious or malicious code is present. The code structure is typical for a module import statement. Since the code is minimal and only imports functions, there's no indication of malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving only to import functions from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
