  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement from a local module. There are no signs of malicious code, data processing, or external communication.\n   - The code snippet is minimal and standard, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1.0 (fully confident)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely an import statement with no malicious behavior, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - All reports correctly assign a risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - There is no evidence of malicious activity or intent.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they focus on the code's actual content and behavior.\n   - The conclusion that the code is benign is justified.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign with no security concerns.**\n\n---\n\n### My Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward import statement with no suspicious or malicious elements. It does not process data, communicate externally, or contain obfuscation. Therefore, it poses no security risk.\n\n**Summary:** All reports are correct; no changes needed.",
