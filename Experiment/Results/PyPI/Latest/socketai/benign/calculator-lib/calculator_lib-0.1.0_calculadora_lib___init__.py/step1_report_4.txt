{
  "purpose": "Import arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) from the local operations module.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the local module 'operations' within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible; this is a static import statement with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple relative import with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a local module named 'operations'. It does not process data, perform any operations, or execute code that could be malicious. The import statement itself is standard Python practice and does not pose security risks. No external inputs or outputs are involved. The minimal code snippet indicates a straightforward import without any suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic import statement with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It is standard Python code for modular design.",
