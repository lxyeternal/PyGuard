{
  "purpose": "Provide a simple calculator API with operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using FastAPI.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via POST requests at endpoints '/add', '/subtract', '/multiply', '/divide'. The data is processed through the 'OperationRequest' model.",
  "sinks": "The results are returned via the 'OperationResponse' model. Division operation includes exception handling for division by zero, which raises an HTTPException.",
  "flows": "Input data from request models flows into calculation functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide). Results are returned as response models.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code relies on standard library functions and clear separation of concerns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a calculator API using FastAPI. It imports necessary modules, defines endpoints for each operation, and performs calculations using imported functions. Exception handling in division ensures safety against division by zero. No suspicious data flows or anomalous code patterns are present. The models and operations are assumed to be standard and secure. The structure and code content suggest intended functionality with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a calculator API with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard practices and libraries, with proper input validation and error handling.",
