  "purpose": "A FastAPI-based calculator API that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).",
  "sources": "Request data from the client via JSON payloads (OperationRequest) for each operation endpoint.",
  "sinks": "The arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) which process the input data; potential for exception handling to reveal error details.",
  "flows": "Input data from the client is passed directly to the arithmetic functions; division endpoint handles ValueError exceptions to prevent crashes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely processes input data for basic calculations, utilizing imported functions for arithmetic operations. Error handling in division endpoint correctly manages division errors without revealing sensitive info. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as network communications, file operations, or code injection are present. Usage of external libraries is standard, with no signs of tampering or malicious modifications. The structure is typical for FastAPI applications, and no anomalies or malicious code features are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a calculator API with no detectable malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly handles input and errors without exposing sensitive information or executing harmful operations. The overall security risk is minimal.",
