  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward FastAPI calculator with four endpoints, importing basic arithmetic functions.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are observed.\n- Exception handling is limited to division by zero, which is appropriate.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code relies on external arithmetic functions presumed to be standard and safe.\n- The reports uniformly assign malware scores of 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Clear, consistent with the code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious features, low security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The low risk score seems reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Slightly lower risk score, still reasonable.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same conclusions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Appropriately low risk.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same, no suspicious features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of malware scores:**\nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward arithmetic nature.\n\n### **Obfuscated scores:**\nAll are 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n\n### **Risk scores:**\n- The highest is 0.2, others are 0.1.\n- These are reasonable, considering the code is simple, with minimal attack surface and no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential issues or points of contention:**\n- The reports do not mention the `calculadora_lib.operations` module's implementation. If this module contains malicious code or obfuscation, that could change the assessment.\n- However, based on the information provided, we assume these functions are standard arithmetic operations.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 is appropriate, given the simplicity and low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe scores given in the reports are consistent with the code's content and logic. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or high security risk.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (considering minimal risk and proper handling)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' evaluations, confirming the code's benign nature.",
