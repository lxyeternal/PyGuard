{
  "purpose": "Provide a simple calculator API with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from HTTP POST request bodies via the OperationRequest model; no other external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the divide function which could raise exceptions if division by zero occurs; no untrusted data is directly written elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input data from request -> operation functions -> response; the divide operation may trigger an exception for invalid input (e.g., division by zero).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code uses straightforward function calls and standard FastAPI patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic API for arithmetic operations, importing functions from a 'calculadora_lib.operations' module, which is presumed to be standard arithmetic functions. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors. Exception handling is limited to division errors, which is appropriate. The code structure is clear and does not contain obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The functions seem to perform simple calculations without side effects or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward calculator API with no malicious or suspicious features. It operates as expected for a basic arithmetic API and does not exhibit any signs of malware or security risks.",
