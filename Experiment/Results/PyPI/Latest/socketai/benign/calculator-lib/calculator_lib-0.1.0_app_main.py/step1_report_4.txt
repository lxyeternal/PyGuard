{
  "purpose": "A simple FastAPI calculator API providing basic arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Input data from HTTP POST requests to endpoints /add, /subtract, /multiply, /divide, specifically from the request body via OperationRequest model.",
  "sinks": "Result is returned as an OperationResponse object; no external data sinks observed. No untrusted data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from API request to operation functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide), and results are sent back in response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code uses standard practices; the only potential concern is division by zero handling, which is properly managed via exception.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic calculator API with four endpoints. It imports functions from a calculadora_lib.operations module; assuming these are standard arithmetic functions, there are no suspicious behaviors. The code does not handle or process any untrusted external data beyond input validation via models, and responses are straightforward. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious data flows are present. No potential malware behaviors, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity, are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate, simple calculator API.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a calculator API with no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security issues. It relies on external arithmetic functions assumed to be safe. Overall, it appears benign.",
