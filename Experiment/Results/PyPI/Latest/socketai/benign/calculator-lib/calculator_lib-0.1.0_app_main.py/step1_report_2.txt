{
  "purpose": "This code implements a simple calculator API with endpoints for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using FastAPI.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from HTTP POST request bodies via the OperationRequest model.",
  "sinks": "Returns calculation results via HTTP responses; no external or untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from request bodies to calculation functions, then to API responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports calculation functions from a library, defines API endpoints, and processes user input to perform arithmetic operations. It properly handles division by zero with exception handling, and no untrusted data manipulation or malicious behavior is evident. The code structure appears standard and secure for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a calculator API with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations with proper error handling, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
