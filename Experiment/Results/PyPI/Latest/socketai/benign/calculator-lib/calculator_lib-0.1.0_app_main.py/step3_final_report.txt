  "purpose": "A simple FastAPI calculator API providing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.",
  "sources": "HTTP POST request bodies containing input numbers; imported arithmetic functions from 'calculadora_lib.operations'.",
  "sinks": "Response returning the calculation result; exception handling for division by zero.",
  "flows": "Input data received via request -> operation functions called -> result returned in response; division by zero triggers exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward calculator API with proper exception handling for division by zero. It imports standard arithmetic functions presumed safe. No external data sinks or malicious code patterns are present. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to division handling, which is correctly managed. No signs of malware, backdoors, or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is justified by proper error handling and the simplicity of the implementation.",
