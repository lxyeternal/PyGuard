  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the validity of claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report indicates no strong malicious indicators, citing standard imports and functions, with some obfuscation and dynamic execution suspected but not confirmed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.1, obfuscated=0.2, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.7\n- **Analysis:** Given the low malware score and minimal obfuscation, the assessment aligns. The confidence is reasonable, though a slight suspicion remains due to the mention of obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears benign, with standard patterns, no suspicious behaviors, and no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Analysis:** The high confidence and zero malware/obfuscation scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is described as a standard module with no malicious traits.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.7\n- **Analysis:** The low risk and malware scores match the benign description.\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is not provided; the report notes no detectable issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.6\n- **Analysis:** Since no code exists, the scores should reflect no risk or malware.\n- **Adjustment:** The securityRisk score should be 0, not 0.2, because there's no code to pose any risk.\n- **Verdict:** Recommend lowering `securityRisk` to 0 for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** No code provided; no analysis possible.\n- **Scores:** all zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Adjustments:\n- **Report 4:** Set `securityRisk` from 0.2 to **0** due to absence of code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- All reports are consistent with their assessments. No evidence suggests malware or obfuscation beyond minor suspicion in Report 1, which is already reflected in low scores.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** approximately **0.1** (consistent with minor suspicion in Report 1).\n- **Obfuscated score:** approximately **0.1-0.2** (mainly due to minimal suspicion in Report 1).\n- **Risk score:** around **0.2-0.3**, considering the low likelihood of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The scores are generally reasonable, with the exception of Report 4's `securityRisk` which should be **0**.\n- The malware and obfuscation scores could be slightly increased from their current low values if you want to reflect minor suspicion, but current values are acceptable.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as is, except adjust Report 4's `securityRisk` to 0 for accuracy.",
