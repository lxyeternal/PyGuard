  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Standard library functions, utility code, and any dynamic or obfuscated code segments.",
  "sinks": "Network operations, file I/O, environment variables, or other external interactions that could leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network connections or file writes, if present.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns like hardcoded secrets or unusual imports.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign across all reports, with no concrete evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Low malware scores (mostly 0 or 0.1) and low obfuscation scores (0 or 0.2) are consistent with the assessments. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited visibility. The only inconsistency is in Report 4, where the absence of code warrants setting the security risk score to 0 instead of 0.2. Overall, the scores align well with the analyses, indicating minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, reflecting the benign nature of the code snippets. Only Report 4 requires minor adjustment of the security risk score to 0. No significant malicious indicators or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
