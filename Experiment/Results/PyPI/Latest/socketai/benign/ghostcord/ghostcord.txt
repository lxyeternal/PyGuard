      "conclusion": "This is a legitimate, straightforward event handling implementation with no malicious intent or behavior. The potential security concern is external handler trustworthiness, which is inherent to such systems. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting the external handler risk but not a flaw in the code itself."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for managing Discord presence with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is potential misuse, which is policy-related rather than security-related. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk should be elevated slightly (e.g., to 0.5) to reflect the potential for abuse, but not due to technical vulnerabilities."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard selfbot framework with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is platform policy violation and potential misuse for spam or automation abuse. The suspicious use of 'Bot' in the authorization header for a selfbot is noteworthy but not malicious per se. Malware score is 0; risk score is approximately 0.4, reflecting policy and misuse concerns."

The low risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern. The potential for misuse in violating Discord's ToS exists but is outside the scope of security analysis. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
