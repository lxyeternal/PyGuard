  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily data structures for Discord entities.\n- No network, file, or system operations are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The disclaimer warns about misuse but does not imply malicious intent.\n- The code is straightforward, with standard Python data classes and simple initializers.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n### Confirming issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- No vulnerabilities, such as injection points or insecure handling, are evident.\n- The input data is processed into class attributes without validation, but this is typical for data models, not malicious.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The only minor note is that the `__init__` methods do not validate input data, but this is standard for simple data classes and not malicious.\n\n### Scores:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `obfuscated: 0`, which is appropriate.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are very low (0 or 0.1), which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The confidence scores are high (0.9 or 1), reflecting the thorough analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.2, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or used maliciously.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Consistently 0 across all reports.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious payloads.\n\n### Assumptions and claims:\n- All claims about the code being purely structural and non-malicious are justified.\n- The disclaimer about TOS violations is standard for Discord selfbot code but does not influence the code's security.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n**Estimated risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, mainly due to the disclaimer and potential misuse, but no actual security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of data classes for Discord entities. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The disclaimer is typical for code that could be used in unauthorized ways but does not indicate malicious behavior itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews provided and the nature of the code.",
