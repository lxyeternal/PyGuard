  "purpose": "Defines data structures and classes for representing Discord users, messages, and activity states.",
  "sources": "Input data for User, Message, and Activity classes (e.g., data dictionaries for instantiation).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no system calls, network connections, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries into class attributes without manipulation that could lead to exploitation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data class definitions for Discord-related entities with constructors that initialize attributes from provided dictionaries. The code includes a disclaimer about misuse with Discord's ToS, but the implementation itself performs standard data modeling without malicious behavior. There are no unsafe operations, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms present. The code is straightforward and intended for data handling only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data modeling module with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It simply structures data related to Discord entities. No malware or security threats are identified.",
