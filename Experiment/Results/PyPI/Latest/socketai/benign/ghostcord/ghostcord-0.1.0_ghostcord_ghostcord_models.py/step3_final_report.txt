  "purpose": "Data classes modeling Discord entities such as User, Message, and Activity for API interactions or data handling.",
  "sources": "Initialization from dictionaries containing entity data (e.g., 'data' parameter in constructors).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data into system or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data input via constructors flows into class attributes; no external or untrusted data is used in sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes with simple initializers parsing dictionaries into attributes. No network, file, or system modifications are present. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are evident. The disclaimer about TOS violations is standard for selfbot code but does not imply malicious intent. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1), consistent with benign data modeling code. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of Discord entity data classes with no malicious or security-risk behavior. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
