  "purpose": "Defines a command handler class for a Discord bot that registers and processes prefix-based commands.",
  "sources": "User messages (message.content) processed in process_commands method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of registered command functions, which could potentially perform arbitrary actions.",
  "flows": "Message.content (source) → process_commands → command lookup → command execution (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious libraries used.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a command handler for a Discord bot. It registers commands via a dictionary and processes incoming messages to trigger command functions. There are no external data leaks, no code injection points, and no suspicious network activity. Error handling is limited to logging. The code relies on external command functions, which are not provided, so potential malicious behavior depends on those implementations. No insecure practices or malicious patterns are detected within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign command handler for a Discord bot. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks on its own. The overall security depends on the commands registered and their implementations.",
