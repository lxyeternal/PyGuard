{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal setup module for a Discord-related library, primarily importing core components and defining a version, with a disclaimer warning about misuse such as selfbots.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.client, .models, .errors, .presence), and the version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not execute any data flow or logic beyond imports and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable element is the prominent disclaimer warning about misuse, but it does not influence code behavior or indicate malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module with import statements and a version string, accompanied by a disclaimer. No executable logic, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The disclaimer indicates potential misuse (selfbots) but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated score as 0, and security risk score as approximately 0.2, reflecting potential misuse warnings but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score appropriately reflects the disclaimer warning about potential misuse, but the code itself is safe.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
