  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate, straightforward event handling implementation with no malicious intent or behavior. The potential security concern is external handler trustworthiness, which is inherent to such systems. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting the external handler risk but not a flaw in the code itself."
