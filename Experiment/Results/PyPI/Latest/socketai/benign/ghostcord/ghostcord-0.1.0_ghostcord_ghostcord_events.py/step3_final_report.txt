  "purpose": "Handles event registration and dispatching for a Discord client, allowing user-defined asynchronous event handlers.",
  "sources": "Method parameters in register() and dispatch() functions, which receive event names and handler functions.",
  "sinks": "Invokes user-defined handler functions asynchronously; logs registration and errors.",
  "flows": "Event name and handler function flow from register() to internal dictionary; dispatch() retrieves and executes handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard event handler pattern for an asynchronous Python application. It registers handlers by name, stores them in a dictionary, and dispatches events by invoking the corresponding handlers asynchronously. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only inherent risk is that handlers are user-defined and could be malicious if untrusted code is registered, but this is typical for event-driven systems. The code itself is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate, straightforward event handling implementation with no malicious intent or behavior. The potential security concern is external handler trustworthiness, which is inherent to such systems. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting the external handler risk but not a flaw in the code itself.",
