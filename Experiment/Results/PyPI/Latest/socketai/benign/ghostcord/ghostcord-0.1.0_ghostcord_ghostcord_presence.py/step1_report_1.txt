{
  "purpose": "This code manages and sets Discord user presence, including rich presence activities, via a client connection.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for methods (status, activity details, timestamps, images, buttons), and data from Activity objects and client websocket connection.",
  "sinks": "Sending JSON payloads over WebSocket (`self.client.ws.send`), logging errors.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> payload construction -> json.dumps() -> websocket send",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code. Usage of async WebSocket communication appears standard. No data leakage or insecure operations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Presence class with methods to set user presence and rich presence on Discord. It constructs JSON payloads for the Discord Gateway protocol, then sends them via a WebSocket connection. It also logs errors if payload sending fails. The code relies on provided data structures and standard json serialization. No suspicious or malicious activities are detected; the code functions as intended for legitimate presence management. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. The disclaimer clarifies the library's intended educational use and warns against TOS violations. Overall, the code appears standard, safe, and aligned with its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical Discord presence updates without any malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard libraries and practices. No malware or suspicious anomalies are detected.",
