  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for managing Discord presence with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is potential misuse, which is policy-related rather than security-related. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk should be elevated slightly (e.g., to 0.5) to reflect the potential for abuse, but not due to technical vulnerabilities."
