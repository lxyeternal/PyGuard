  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its functionality, and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages Discord presence and rich presence, sending JSON payloads over WebSocket. No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and the malware score is 0.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion that there's no malicious behavior or security risk is consistent with the code. The code is straightforward, standard, and does not exhibit any anomalies.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0. This aligns well with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the potential for misuse due to TOS violations, but no malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly states that the code is legitimate in terms of security, with a low security risk score (0.2). The malware score remains 0.\n- **Score justification:** The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable given the TOS violation potential, but not a security vulnerability. Malware remains 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code constructs presence payloads and sends over WebSocket, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion that the code is standard and safe is consistent. The risk score of 0.1 is appropriate, and malware is 0.\n- **Score justification:** No issues here; the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with no suspicious or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears legitimate, with no obfuscation or backdoors. The risk score of 0.2 and malware score of 0 are justified.\n- **Score justification:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, standard presence management code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code snippet does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic. It simply manages Discord presence via WebSocket, which is a standard operation for such libraries.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign malware = 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting potential TOS violations but not security vulnerabilities. This is reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification and Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, mainly due to TOS violations, not security risks)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard implementation of Discord presence management. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code, nor does it exhibit security vulnerabilities. The potential misuse relates to TOS violations, not security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.15 (average of the reported scores, justified by TOS violation potential but no security concern)  \n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more conservative or aggressive scoring approach.",
