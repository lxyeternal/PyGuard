  "conclusion": "The code is a standard selfbot framework with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is platform policy violation and potential misuse for spam or automation abuse. The suspicious use of 'Bot' in the authorization header for a selfbot is noteworthy but not malicious per se. Malware score is 0; risk score is approximately 0.4, reflecting policy and misuse concerns."
