  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, the logic, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a typical selfbot client for Discord, handling WebSocket events, message operations, and event dispatching. No malicious code is evident; the main concern is the violation of Discord's ToS due to selfbot use.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 — low, primarily due to TOS violation.\n\n- **Assessment**: The report is consistent. The code is standard, with no malware or malicious logic. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard WebSocket and HTTP interactions, with no malicious behavior. It notes the use of a bot token but recognizes the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 — low, considering TOS violation but no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment**: The scoring aligns with the analysis. The code is a typical selfbot framework with no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, a standard selfbot client with message handling and event dispatching. No malicious code or malware observed. The main concern is TOS violation.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — consistent.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n- **Assessment**: The report's scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to previous reports, with standard functionality and no malicious code. It mentions the use of a bot token but recognizes the potential misuse as a selfbot.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — aligns with the absence of malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score**: 0.3 — slightly higher, possibly due to the potential for misuse.\n\n- **Assessment**: Slightly higher risk score reflects the potential misuse, but the code itself isn't malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a standard selfbot implementation. Notably, it uses a 'Bot' prefix in the Authorization header, which is unusual for selfbots (which typically use user tokens without 'Bot'). The disclaimer explicitly states selfbot use, which violates ToS.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk**: 0.5 — higher due to the suspicious use of 'Bot' prefix in the header, which could indicate misconfiguration or attempt to disguise the true nature of the token.\n\n- **Confidence**: 0.6 — moderate, given the discrepancy in the authorization header and the purpose.\n\n- **Assessment**: The use of 'Bot' prefix with a user token is suspicious and could be a sign of misconfiguration or an attempt to mask selfbot activity as a bot. This is a potential security concern because it could be exploited to bypass certain restrictions or mislead detection. The overall malware score remains 0, but the security risk is higher due to this anomaly.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Notes |\n|----------|---------|--------------|--------------|--------|\n| 1        | 0       | 0            | 0.2          | Appropriate |\n| 2        | 0       | 0            | 0.2          | Appropriate |\n| 3        | 0       | 0            | 0.2          | Appropriate |\n| 4        | 0       | 0            | 0.3          | Slightly higher due to potential misuse |\n| 5        | 0       | 0            | 0.5          | Justified due to suspicious header usage |\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** — no malicious code or payloads detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** — code appears straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score**: **0.2–0.5** — generally low, with Report 5 justifiably higher due to suspicious header usage.\n\n**Overall**, the code is a standard selfbot client with no embedded malware. The main concern is the violation of Discord's ToS, especially in Report 5, where the use of 'Bot' in the authorization header with a user token is suspicious and could be exploited or misused.\n\n---\n\n**Final note**: Given the nature of selfbots and the potential for misuse, the security risk is primarily platform policy violation rather than technical malware. The scores should reflect this, with malware at 0 and risk scores varying based on suspicious implementation details.",
