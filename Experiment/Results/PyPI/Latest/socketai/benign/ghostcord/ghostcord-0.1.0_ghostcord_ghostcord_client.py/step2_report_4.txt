  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the details, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard Discord selfbot functionality—message send/edit/delete, event handling—no anomalies.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code explicitly states it's for educational/authorized use, with a disclaimer about TOS violations. The token is handled securely, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, malware score 0, security risk low (~0.2).  \n**Score justification:** The report's malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is consistent. The overall security risk is low, aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard Discord client for message and event handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Again, mentions authorized/educational use, no malicious code, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score 0, security risk low (~0.2).  \n**Score justification:** Consistent with the report's assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard selfbot client, handling WebSocket events, message operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code uses a bot token with 'Bot' prefix, but the disclaimer states it's for selfbot use—this is suspicious, as selfbots typically use user tokens without 'Bot' prefix. No malicious code detected, but the purpose is against ToS.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score 0, security risk low (~0.2).  \n**Score justification:** The discrepancy in token usage is noted but does not imply malware. The assessment is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, with standard WebSocket and HTTP interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code states it's for educational/authorized use, but the use of 'Bot' in the Authorization header for a selfbot is suspicious. No malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score 0, security risk moderate (~0.3).  \n**Score justification:** The higher security risk (0.3) is justified due to the potential misuse as a selfbot, which violates ToS, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar implementation, with explicit mention of selfbot usage.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The report notes the suspicious use of 'Bot' prefix in the Authorization header for a selfbot, which is inconsistent with typical selfbot tokens (usually raw tokens). The disclaimer states intended for authorized use, but the token handling is suspicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score 0, but security risk is higher (~0.5) due to potential misuse and misconfiguration.  \n**Score justification:** The moderate security risk is justified, considering the potential for abuse and platform violations, but no malware is embedded.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports consistently assign 0, which aligns with the code's content—no malicious payloads, no exfiltration, no backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Range from 0.2 to 0.5, reflecting the potential for misuse as a selfbot and TOS violations, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the repeated mention of selfbot functionality, TOS violations, and suspicious token handling (using 'Bot' prefix for a selfbot), I would assign a **risk score of approximately 0.4**. This reflects a moderate security concern primarily due to platform violations and potential misuse, not active malware.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score / Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0 — no malicious payloads or behaviors detected                     |\n| Obfuscated         | 0 — code is transparent and not obfuscated                          |\n| Security Risk      | ~0.4 — moderate risk due to TOS violation potential and misuse     |\n\n**Final note:** The code itself is a typical selfbot framework with no embedded malware. The primary concern is the violation of Discord's ToS and potential misuse, which justifies a moderate risk score.",
