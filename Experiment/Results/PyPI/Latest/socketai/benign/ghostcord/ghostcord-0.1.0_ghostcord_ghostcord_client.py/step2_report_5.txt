  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code logic, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical selfbot client for Discord, handling WebSocket events, message operations, and event dispatching. No malicious code, backdoors, or malware are evident. The token is handled securely, and the logic is straightforward.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to TOS violation concerns, not security.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard selfbot functionalities, with no malicious actions detected. The code is well-structured, and token management appears secure.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — aligns with TOS violation but no security threat.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard selfbot framework with no malware. The main concern is TOS violation, not security.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, noting that the code could be used maliciously but does not contain malicious code itself.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 — slightly higher, possibly due to the potential misuse of selfbot capabilities.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Recognizes that the code is a standard selfbot implementation, explicitly states that it violates Discord's ToS, and notes that the Authorization header uses 'Bot' prefix, which is suspicious for a selfbot (which should use a user token without 'Bot'). The risk score is higher (0.5), reflecting potential misuse.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 — reasonable given the TOS violation and potential for misuse.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6 — moderate confidence, considering the discrepancy in token usage.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly flags the potential misuse and the suspicious use of 'Bot' prefix, which could be a misconfiguration or an indicator of malicious intent if misused.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree at 0, and I concur. No malware or malicious payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent across reports.\n- **Security risk:** While the code enables automation that could be exploited (spam, abuse), it does not contain inherent malicious code. The risk scores range from 0.2 to 0.5, with the highest in report 5 due to TOS violation concerns and token usage anomalies.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to TOS violation potential, not technical security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The primary concern is the violation of Discord's ToS through selfbot usage, not the presence of malware or security vulnerabilities. The suspicious use of the 'Bot' prefix in the Authorization header in report 5 warrants attention but isn't necessarily malicious by itself.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard selfbot client framework with no embedded malware. Its risks are mainly platform policy violations, not security threats.",
