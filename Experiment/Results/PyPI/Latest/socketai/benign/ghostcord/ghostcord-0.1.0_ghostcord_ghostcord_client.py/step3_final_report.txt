{
  "purpose": "A Discord selfbot client designed for message handling, event dispatching, and WebSocket communication, primarily for automation and interaction with Discord's API.",
  "sources": "Reads token during initialization, receives WebSocket messages, and makes HTTP requests for message operations and reactions.",
  "sinks": "WebSocket message reception and HTTP responses, especially in send/edit/delete/reaction functions, where untrusted data could influence behavior if mishandled.",
  "flows": "WebSocket messages (from Discord) trigger event dispatches; message send/edit/delete functions send data to Discord API; token is used in headers for authentication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Bot' prefix in Authorization header for a selfbot, which is unusual and suspicious; potential misconfiguration or attempt to disguise selfbot activity as a bot.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Discord selfbot, handling WebSocket events, message operations, and event commands. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The token handling is standard, but the use of 'Bot' prefix in the Authorization header for a selfbot is inconsistent with typical usage and raises suspicion. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network spying, or system damage. The primary concern is the violation of Discord's ToS due to selfbot activity, which is not a technical security flaw but a policy violation. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is 0, indicating clear and straightforward code. The security risk score is moderate (~0.4), mainly due to the platform policy violation and potential misuse for spam or abuse, especially considering the header anomaly in some reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard selfbot framework with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is platform policy violation and potential misuse for spam or automation abuse. The suspicious use of 'Bot' in the authorization header for a selfbot is noteworthy but not malicious per se. Malware score is 0; risk score is approximately 0.4, reflecting policy and misuse concerns.",
