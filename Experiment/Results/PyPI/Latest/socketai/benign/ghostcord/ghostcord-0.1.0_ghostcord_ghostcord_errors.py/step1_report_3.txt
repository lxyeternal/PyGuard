  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to GhostCord, a Discord-related library or tool.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potential data leaks; no output or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow occurs in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. The exceptions are specialized for handling errors such as rate limits and authentication issues, with a disclaimer warning about misuse and the risks associated with Discord's Terms of Service. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues in this fragment. The structure is straightforward and typical for error handling in Python libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for defining custom exceptions and includes a disclaimer about educational use and TOS risks. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security threats.",
