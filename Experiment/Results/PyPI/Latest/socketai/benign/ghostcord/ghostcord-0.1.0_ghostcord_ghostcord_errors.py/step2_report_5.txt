  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's Exception class.\n- Each report notes the absence of data processing, input/output, or any suspicious activity.\n- The disclaimer warns about potential misuse, particularly regarding Discord selfbots, but does not reflect malicious intent within the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code content:** The code matches the description—simple exception class definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Anomalies:** The only notable element is the disclaimer warning about TOS violations, which is common in such libraries but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical errors:** None. The class definitions are standard and correct.\n- **Security flaws:** None. The code is benign.\n- **Misleading claims:** The disclaimer is appropriate for context but does not impact code security.\n\n### Scores and their Reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, accurate.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.2; given the code's benign nature, these are reasonable. The only point of contention is the disclaimer, which indicates potential misuse but does not constitute a security risk.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since there's no actual malicious activity, malware score should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score is low, reflecting the benign code but acknowledging potential misuse warnings.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- The reports assign a security risk of up to 0.2 in some cases due to the disclaimer. While the disclaimer indicates awareness of misuse, it does not increase actual security risk in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (due to disclaimer warning about misuse, but not actual security threat)\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions with a standard disclaimer warning about potential misuse. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting the disclaimer but not actual malicious intent)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code snippet.",
