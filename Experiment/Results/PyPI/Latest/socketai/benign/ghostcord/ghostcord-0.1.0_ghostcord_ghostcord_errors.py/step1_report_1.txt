  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to GhostCord, likely a Discord-related library or bot.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains class definitions and a disclaimer comment.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The disclaimer explicitly states the library is intended for educational use only and warns against misuse, including violating Discord's ToS by using selfbots. The code itself is simple exception class definitions with no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception, with no evidence of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The disclaimer indicates awareness of potential misuse but does not reflect malicious intent in the code itself. There are no sources or sinks, and no data flows or anomalies present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for defining custom exceptions. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected. The disclaimer suggests awareness of misuse but does not indicate malicious intent within the code itself.",
