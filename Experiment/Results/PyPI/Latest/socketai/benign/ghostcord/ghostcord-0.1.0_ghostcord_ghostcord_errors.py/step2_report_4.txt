  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the context, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class.\n- There are no data flows, input handling, network operations, or code execution.\n- The disclaimer warns about potential misuse, specifically regarding Discord's ToS and selfbots, but this is a comment and does not impact the code's behavior.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes and contains a disclaimer comment. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning flaws:**  \n  None. The reports accurately describe the code as benign, standard, and free of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores and their reasonableness:**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.  \n  The security risk scores vary slightly (0 to 0.2), reflecting the disclaimer about potential misuse but not actual malicious activity. These seem reasonable.\n\n### Justification of risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Malware scores:\n- All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent; they focus on the code's content and disclaimers.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores and conclusions are consistent with the code and the context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.**  \nThe disclaimer reflects awareness of potential misuse but does not imply malicious intent. The exception classes are standard for error handling in a Python library.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\n- **Malware:** 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1, minimal risk due to disclaimer warning about misuse, but no actual threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with an informative disclaimer. No adjustments to the existing scores are necessary.",
