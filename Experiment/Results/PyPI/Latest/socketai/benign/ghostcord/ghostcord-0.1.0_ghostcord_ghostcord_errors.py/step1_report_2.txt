  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to a Discord-related library, likely for managing errors such as rate limiting and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The disclaimer at the top indicates awareness of TOS but is not part of the executable code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no input sources, no data processing, no network or filesystem operations, and no dynamic code execution. The disclaimer is a comment and does not impact code execution. Overall, the code appears to serve a standard purpose for error handling in a larger application and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining exception classes for error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard, benign part of a larger application.",
