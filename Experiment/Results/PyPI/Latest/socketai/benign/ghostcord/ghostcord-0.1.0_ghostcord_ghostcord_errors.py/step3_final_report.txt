  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to GhostCord operations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception, no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no network or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are simply definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a disclaimer comment warning about misuse, but no malicious or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions, with no data processing, network activity, or obfuscated code. The disclaimer warns about potential misuse but does not influence code behavior or indicate malicious intent. No anomalies, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is correctly 0, as there is no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The risk score is minimal (around 0.1-0.2), primarily due to the disclaimer warning about misuse, but this does not constitute an actual security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard exception class definitions with a disclaimer warning about potential misuse. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
