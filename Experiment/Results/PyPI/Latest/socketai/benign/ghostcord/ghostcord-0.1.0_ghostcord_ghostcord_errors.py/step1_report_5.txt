  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to GhostCord, a Discord-related library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; code consists solely of class definitions and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; no code execution or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No data flow; just class inheritance structures for exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a disclaimer warning about TOS violations and selfbots, which is common in Discord scripting but indicates potential misuse. No malicious code or suspicious behavior detected in the class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from the base Exception class, with descriptive docstrings. The disclaimer warns about TOS violations and the use of selfbots, which suggests the library might be used in contexts against Discord’s policies. The code itself does not contain any malicious logic, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It appears to be standard error handling setup.",
  "conclusion": "There is no malicious behavior or security risk within the provided code segment. The disclaimer indicates potential misuse but is not part of malicious code. The code is straightforward and safe from a security perspective.",
