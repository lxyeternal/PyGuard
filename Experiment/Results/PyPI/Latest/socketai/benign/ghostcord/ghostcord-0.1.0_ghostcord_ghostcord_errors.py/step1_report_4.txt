{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling related to GhostCord, a Discord-related library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; only class definitions and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths, as the code only declares exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a prominent disclaimer warning about misuse and the risks of using selfbots on Discord, which indicates potential for misuse but is not malicious code itself.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base exception, with descriptive docstrings. The disclaimer warns about the potential misuse of the library, particularly regarding Discord selfbots, which are against Discord's ToS. There are no suspicious code behaviors such as data exfiltration, malicious commands, or obfuscated code. The structure is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices for exception handling. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident within these class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as error handling structure with a disclaimer warning users about potential misuse. No malicious activity or security risks are present within this fragment.",
