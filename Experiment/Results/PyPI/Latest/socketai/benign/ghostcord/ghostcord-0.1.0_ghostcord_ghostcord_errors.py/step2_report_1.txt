  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same simple code: defining custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception.\n- Each includes a disclaimer warning about potential misuse, especially regarding Discord's ToS and selfbots.\n- No actual data processing, input/output, network activity, or code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Defines custom exceptions.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Benign, standard code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n### Report 2\n- Same as above, with similar reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n### Report 3\n- Similar content, straightforward exception classes.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n### Report 4\n- Same pattern, with emphasis on the disclaimer warning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — still reasonable given the simplicity.\n\n### Report 5\n- Similar analysis; the only deviation is a slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — possibly overestimating risk based solely on disclaimer.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — acceptable, but the securityRisk might be slightly inflated.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Given the code's benign nature, even with the disclaimer, a securityRisk of 0.2 (as in report 5) seems slightly high. The disclaimer alone does not constitute a security risk in the code; it’s more of a warning for users.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The **risk score** should probably remain at 0 or very close to it, as the code does not pose a security threat.\n- The **malware score** remains 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Metric             | Justification                                                                                         |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0 — No malicious behavior detected.                                                                |\n| Obfuscated         | 0 — Clear, straightforward class definitions.                                                        |\n| Security Risk      | 0 — No security issues; disclaimer does not imply actual risk.                                      |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, and the scores should reflect that.**",
