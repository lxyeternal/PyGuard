  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a Discord API rate limiter. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security flaws. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern. The potential for misuse in violating Discord's ToS exists but is outside the scope of security analysis. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
