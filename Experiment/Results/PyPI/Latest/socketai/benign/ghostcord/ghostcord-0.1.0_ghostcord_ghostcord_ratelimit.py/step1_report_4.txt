{
  "purpose": "Implements a rate limiter for Discord API requests, likely to avoid hitting rate limits.",
  "sources": "Reads system time via asyncio.get_event_loop().time() and controls request flow through internal variables.",
  "sinks": "Uses asyncio.sleep() to delay requests based on rate limits, affecting request timing but not directly leaking data.",
  "flows": "Reads time -> controls requests count -> delays requests to comply with rate limits.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code appears focused solely on rate limiting.",
  "analysis": "The code manages Discord API rate limits using an asyncio lock and timing variables. It increases request count with each context entry and enforces delays if limits are exceeded. The code is standard for rate limiting, with no signs of data leakage, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. Its purpose is aligned with API request regulation, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Discord API rate limiter with no malicious intent. It does not contain malware or security risks but is part of a tool that could be used in a selfbot, which violates Discord ToS. The code itself is benign from a security perspective.",
