  "purpose": "Generate a unique nonce for Discord API requests, likely used in bot or script operations.",
  "sources": "time.time() and random.randint() functions used to generate components of the nonce.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing a string; no untrusted data flow to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "Input functions (time and random) → generate_nonce() → return string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscation or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code generates a nonce by combining the current timestamp with a random integer, which is typical for creating unique identifiers. It uses standard library functions without any suspicious behavior or external network activity. The disclaimer suggests awareness of Discord's ToS but does not imply malicious intent. No malicious code, data leaks, or malicious side effects are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for generating nonces with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
