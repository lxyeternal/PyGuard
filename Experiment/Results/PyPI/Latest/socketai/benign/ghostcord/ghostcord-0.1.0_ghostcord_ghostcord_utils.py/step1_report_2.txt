{
  "purpose": "Generate a unique nonce for Discord API requests, likely used in request validation or tracking.",
  "sources": "The function generate_nonce() reads the current time and generates a random integer to create the nonce.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not send data over network or write to files.",
  "flows": "Source: time.time() and random.randint() -> generate_nonce() -> returns string nonce.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no unusual or obfuscated patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple nonce generator combining current timestamp in milliseconds with a random number. It relies on standard library functions without any suspicious behavior. No external inputs beyond system time and random number generation, both of which are common in such contexts. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves a typical purpose of generating unique identifiers for requests. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
