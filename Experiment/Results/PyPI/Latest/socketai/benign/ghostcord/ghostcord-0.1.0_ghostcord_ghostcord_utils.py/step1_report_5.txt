  "purpose": "Generate a unique nonce for Discord API requests",
  "sources": "time.time() and random.randint() functions for generating values",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the generated nonce string",
  "flows": "time.time() and random.randint() provide data to string concatenation for the nonce",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code includes a disclaimer warning about Discord selfbots, which is a known TOS violation, but this does not indicate malicious code within this snippet itself.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that creates a nonce by concatenating the current timestamp (in milliseconds) with a random number between 1000 and 9999. The use of standard library functions for generating the nonce is benign and common in API request signing. The disclaimer suggests the code may be intended for Discord automation or selfbot activities, which are against Discord TOS, but this is a usage concern rather than a code security issue. No obfuscated code, malicious payload, or suspicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward nonce generator without any malicious behavior or security risks. The disclaimer indicates potential misuse in context, but the code itself is benign.",
