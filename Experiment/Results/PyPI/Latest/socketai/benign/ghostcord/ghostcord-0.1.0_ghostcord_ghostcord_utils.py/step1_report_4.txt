  "purpose": "Generate a unique nonce for Discord API requests",
  "sources": "time.time() and random.randint() for generating nonce components",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the nonce string, no external sinks",
  "flows": "time and random number are combined to produce a nonce string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard libraries for nonce generation",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries 'random' and 'time' and defines a function that creates a nonce by concatenating the current timestamp in milliseconds with a random four-digit number. The purpose appears to be for generating unique request identifiers, likely for API calls. No hardcoded secrets, external data inputs, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious activities. It is straightforward and aligns with typical nonce generation practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended solely for creating unique nonces for API requests. No malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.",
