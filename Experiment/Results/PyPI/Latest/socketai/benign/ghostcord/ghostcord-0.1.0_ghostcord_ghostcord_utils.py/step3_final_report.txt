  "purpose": "Generate a unique nonce for Discord API requests by concatenating current timestamp in milliseconds with a random 4-digit number.",
  "sources": "time.time() for current timestamp; random.randint() for random number generation.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only returns a string nonce without data transmission or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input sources (time and random) directly feed into the return statement as a concatenated string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward nonce generation with standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries to generate a nonce by combining current time in milliseconds with a random number. No network activity, data exfiltration, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The disclaimer about Discord TOS violations pertains to usage, not code behavior. Scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero; security risk is minimal and justified by context, not code flaws. Confidence is high due to code simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward nonce generator with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. Minor security risk scores reflect potential misuse context but do not indicate actual threats. Overall, the code is safe and scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
