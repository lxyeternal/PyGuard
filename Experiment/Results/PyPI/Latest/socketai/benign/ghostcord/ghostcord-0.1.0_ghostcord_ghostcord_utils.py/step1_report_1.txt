  "purpose": "Generate a unique nonce for Discord API requests.",
  "sources": "time.time() and random.randint() functions used to generate values for nonce.",
  "sinks": "The generated nonce could be used as an identifier or token in API requests, but the code itself does not send or transmit data.",
  "flows": "time.time() and random.randint() generate numerical values -> concatenated into a string as nonce.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the disclaimer warns about Discord selfbots but does not affect the code logic directly.",
  "analysis": "The code generates a nonce by combining the current timestamp in milliseconds with a random number between 1000 and 9999. The functions used are standard for nonce creation. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The disclaimer indicates awareness of potential misuse, but the code itself performs a benign function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, generates a nonce for API requests, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
