  "purpose": "Test functions verifying neighborhood mask generation and tensor processing functions (rihog, rihog_naive).",
  "sources": "Internal functions _get_nbhd_masks, rihog, rihog_naive; data generated via torch.rand with fixed seed.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; internal tensor operations only.",
  "flows": "Input tensors fed into neighborhood mask functions and rihog functions; outputs compared for consistency.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward test functions for spatial neighborhood masks and tensor transformations. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The functions tested are standard in spatial data processing. The imported functions' implementations are unknown but appear legitimate based on usage. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are observed. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of test routines for neighborhood mask generation and tensor processing, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
