  "purpose": "Import various classes and functions related to RIHOG from a local module for processing or computation.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module (.rihog).",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; import statements do not typically involve data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns detected; purely an import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement importing multiple classes and functions from a relative module named 'rihog'. It does not include dynamic execution, user input handling, or other operations that could lead to security risks. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. It appears to be part of a larger codebase where these imported components are used elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a normal part of a Python module importing necessary components for further processing.",
