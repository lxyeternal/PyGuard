{
  "purpose": "Import various classes and functions from the 'rihog' module, likely for image or signal processing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing classes and functions from the local module '.rihog'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as this is only an import statement without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected in the import statement.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs an import from a relative module '.rihog'. It lists specific classes and functions being imported, which suggests modular code organization. There is no executable logic, data handling, or network activity present. The import appears standard for a Python project, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Since this is only a single import statement, it cannot be assessed for malicious behavior beyond verifying that it is importing from a local module, which is common practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement importing classes and functions from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
