{
  "purpose": "The code imports several classes and functions from a module named 'rihog' within the same package, likely for image processing or feature extraction related to RIHOG (possibly a custom or standard descriptor).",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module file 'rihog' within the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this snippet; no data is processed or output occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible from this minimal import statement alone; it only establishes dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the import statements are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports specific classes and functions from a local module. There is no dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior evident. The structure is typical for a module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely brings in functions and classes from a local module named 'rihog'.",
