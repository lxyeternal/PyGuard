{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be an import statement that loads classes and functions related to RIHOG, which is likely a feature extraction or image processing module.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module named 'rihog', specifically RIHOG, NaiveRIHOG, NeighborhoodShape, RelativeMagnitudeMode, rihog, rihog_naive.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are evident; the code only performs import operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink path is observable in this snippet; it simply imports definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. The import is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "This code is a standard import statement, referencing a module likely related to feature extraction or image analysis. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. No external data or untrusted input is processed here. The code structure is simple and conventional, with no suspicious or hidden operations.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no signs of malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears to serve the purpose of importing necessary classes and functions from a local module for further processing.",
