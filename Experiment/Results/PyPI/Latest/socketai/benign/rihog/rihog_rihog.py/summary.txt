  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a rotation-invariant histogram of oriented gradients feature extractor. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
