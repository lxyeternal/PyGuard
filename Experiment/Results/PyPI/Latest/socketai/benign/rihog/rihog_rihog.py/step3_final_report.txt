{
  "purpose": "The code implements a rotation-invariant histogram of oriented gradients (RIHOG) feature extractor for images, computing gradient magnitudes and orientations within neighborhoods, then binning and normalizing these features into histograms.",
  "sources": "Input tensor 'batch' representing images; tensor operations reading gradients, neighborhood masks, and histogram binning parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration; purely local tensor computations.",
  "flows": "Input 'batch' -> gradient computation -> neighborhood masking -> histogram binning -> output tensor of histograms.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Use of standard tensor operations and assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing operations: gradient calculation, neighborhood masking, angle binning, and histogram normalization. It uses assertions for parameter validation and tensor operations consistent with benign image feature extraction routines. No external data flows, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The implementation aligns with typical feature extraction methods, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a rotation-invariant histogram of oriented gradients feature extractor. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
