{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports specific functions and classes from a local 'scraper' module, exposes them via __all__, and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local '.scraper' module",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted inputs are processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "None; the code only manages exports and versioning without data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module setup with import statements, export definitions, and a version string. It contains no external input handling, network activity, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose, and the assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization snippet with no malicious or security concerns. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
