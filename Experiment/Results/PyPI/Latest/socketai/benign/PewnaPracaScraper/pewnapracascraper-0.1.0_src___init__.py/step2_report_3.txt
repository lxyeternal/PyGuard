  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code snippets are minimal, standard Python module initialization code.\n- They import functions/classes from a local module `.scraper`.\n- They define `__all__` for exports and `__version__`.\n- No external input, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- The code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious logic or vulnerabilities.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- No external communication or dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No issues are present in the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing the report evaluations:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- Purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, analysis, conclusion: all indicate a benign, standard module export.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0  \n**Verdict:** Correct. No change needed.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- Similar assessment: benign module setup, no malicious activity.\n- Scores: all zero, confidence=1  \n**Verdict:** Correct. No change needed.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- Same as above: straightforward, no suspicious behavior.\n- Scores: all zero, confidence=1  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- Same conclusion: standard module export, no issues.\n- Scores: all zero, confidence=1  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Again, a typical module setup with no signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores: all zero, confidence=1  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final justification:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- The malware score remains at 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated score remains at 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Risk score remains at 0, since there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and standard)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard Python module setup with no malicious or security issues. The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways keep in mind that this code is a small part of a larger package. While this snippet is benign, security assessments should consider the entire package, especially the implementation of `scraper.py`.",
