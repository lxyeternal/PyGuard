{
  "purpose": "The code defines module exports and versioning for a scraper-related package, facilitating import and version management.",
  "sources": "The code imports from a local module '.scraper' to access 'scrape' and 'ScrapeError' functions or classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data outputs; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform any actions that could leak data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code merely sets up exports and version info without processing or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or unusual code structures. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions or classes from a local module, sets the '__all__' variable for exports, and defines a version string. It contains no user input handling, network operations, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign module setup with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions to expose certain components and version info, typical for Python modules.",
