  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code exports symbols from a local module and sets a version.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows, as expected.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and standard.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same observations; straightforward module export code.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Consistent with previous assessments; no issues detected.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also aligns with previous conclusions; standard module boilerplate.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n---\n\n**Overall analysis:**\n- The code snippets are minimal, standard, and do not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are present.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The malware scores are correctly set at 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are correctly at 0.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, at 0.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the actual code. The code is a typical Python module setup for exposing functions and version info, with no security concerns.",
