{
  "purpose": "Defines module exports and version for a scraper utility",
  "sources": "Imports from .scraper module, accessing __all__ and __version__ variables",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or exfiltrated",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and error classes from a local module, then declares export symbols and a version string. It contains no logic, data handling, or external communications. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python module's init file. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard module boilerplate for exporting symbols and version information. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
