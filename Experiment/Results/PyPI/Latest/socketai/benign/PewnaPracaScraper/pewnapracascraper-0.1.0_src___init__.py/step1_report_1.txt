{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that exports specific functions and classes from a module named 'scraper', and sets a version string. Its purpose is likely to provide an API for web scraping functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads from its own module to import 'scrape' and 'ScrapeError'. It also reads the '__version__' string. There are no external input sources like user input, network, or files.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply imports and exposes symbols, and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are evident. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious constructs, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports symbols from a local module 'scraper' and exposes them via __all__, indicating a modular design. It also defines a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hidden backdoors, network activity, or obfuscated code. The code is simple, standard, and appears to be part of a larger, legitimate package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export and version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and typical for Python package modules.",
