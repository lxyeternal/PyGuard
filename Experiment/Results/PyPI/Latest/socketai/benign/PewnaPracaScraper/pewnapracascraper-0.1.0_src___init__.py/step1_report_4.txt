{
  "purpose": "This code defines an import interface for a scraper module, exporting specific functions and errors, and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; imports from a local module, likely within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only establishes module exports and version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and exceptions from a local module, exposes them via __all__, and sets a version string. There are no input handling, no data processing, no network connections, or other suspicious behaviors. The simplicity suggests standard module export code with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module interface setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It merely exports functions and defines a version string, typical for Python packages.",
