{
  "purpose": "The code is a web scraper utilizing Playwright to fetch and return fully rendered HTML content from a specified URL, with URL normalization and random user-agent selection.",
  "sources": "The URL input parameter, the random user-agent list, and the Playwright page.goto method which fetches the webpage.",
  "sinks": "The page.content() method outputs the HTML content; potential data leaks are not present but the content could be exposed if misused.",
  "flows": "Input URL flows into the 'full_url' variable, then into 'page.goto', and finally the content is retrieved via 'page.content()' and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard web scraping tasks with proper URL normalization, user-agent randomization, and error handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The use of 'playwright' and random user agents is typical for such tasks. Error handling captures timeouts and general exceptions, raising a custom ScrapeError. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured web scraper with no indicators of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the inherent risks of fetching untrusted web content, which is typical for such scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minor inherent risks but no malicious activity.",
