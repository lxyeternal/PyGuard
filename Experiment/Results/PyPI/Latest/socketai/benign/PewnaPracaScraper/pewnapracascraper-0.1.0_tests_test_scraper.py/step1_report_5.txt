  "flows": "Input: domain string 'example.com' -> 'scrape' function retrieves HTML -> stored in 'html' -> checked for specific content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious operations detected. The code uses a third-party library for scraping but without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a scraper library, uses it to retrieve webpage content, and asserts the presence of a title tag. No dynamic code execution, environment variable misuse, or malicious network activity is present. The use of 'PlaywrightScraper' suggests standard web scraping functionality. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform a straightforward web scraping and validation task without malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on an external library presumed to be legitimate. No indications of malware or malicious intent found.",
