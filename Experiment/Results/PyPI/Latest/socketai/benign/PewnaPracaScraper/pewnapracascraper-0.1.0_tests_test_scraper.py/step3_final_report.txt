  "purpose": "A simple web scraping test using PlaywrightScraper to fetch example.com and verify the page title.",
  "sources": "The 'scrape' function from PlaywrightScraper, invoked with 'example.com'.",
  "sinks": "The function returns HTML content; the assertion checks for a specific string within this content.",
  "flows": "Input URL 'example.com' is processed by 'scrape', resulting in HTML content checked for the title string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward fetch of a well-known website and asserts the presence of a specific title. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious activities are present. The use of a legitimate scraping library and simple assertion indicates benign intent. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward web scraping test with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
