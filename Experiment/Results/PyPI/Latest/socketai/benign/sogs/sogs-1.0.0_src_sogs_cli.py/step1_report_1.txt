  "purpose": "The script reads a PLY file, processes it with compression, and saves the output to a specified directory.",
  "sources": "cfg.ply (input file path), cfg.output_dir (output directory)",
  "sinks": "os.makedirs (creates directories), read_ply (reads input file), run_compression (processes and saves data)",
  "flows": "cfg.ply → read_ply; cfg.output_dir → os.makedirs and run_compression",
  "anomalies": "None apparent; code uses standard library and well-named functions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line arguments into a Config object, then creates the output directory if it doesn't exist. It reads a PLY file specified by the user and performs compression on its data, saving results to the output directory. All operations involve standard libraries or imported modules whose functions are presumed safe. No untrusted data handling or external network operations are visible. The code appears to be a typical processing script for 3D data files.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility script for processing PLY files with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external functions 'read_ply' and 'run_compression' which are assumed safe and appropriate for their purpose.",
