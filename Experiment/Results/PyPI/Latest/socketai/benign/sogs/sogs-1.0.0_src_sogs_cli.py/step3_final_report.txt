  "purpose": "Process a 3D PLY file by reading it and applying compression, then save output to specified directory.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for file paths, external functions read_ply and run_compression",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows into insecure operations or external systems",
  "flows": "CLI args -> read_ply -> run_compression -> output directory",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that accepts input and output paths, creates directories safely, reads a PLY file, and processes it with external functions presumed safe. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are present. External functions' internal behaviors are unknown but assumed benign based on naming. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data processing script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified given the evidence.",
