  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific task, but the exact nature cannot be determined from the provided snippet alone due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, function parameters, and potentially external data files or network sources, though none are explicitly shown in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network requests, or data storage mechanisms where untrusted data might be exploited, but specific sinks are not evident in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to sinks, but without concrete code, the exact flow cannot be mapped precisely.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are apparent from the provided snippet. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined in its entirety, focusing on all segments for signs of malicious activity, unusual data handling, or obfuscation. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior were identified. The code’s structure appears typical, and third-party library usage is not inherently suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious anomalies or malicious intents detected.",
