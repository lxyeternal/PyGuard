{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'hello' from a module named 'main' within the same package, likely for executing or utilizing that function elsewhere.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only performs an import statement from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows within this minimal code fragment; it simply performs a static import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a simple relative import of the 'hello' function from the local 'main' module. It does not include any data processing, network activity, or other potentially malicious actions. Given its simplicity, it appears to be a standard import statement with no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard import operation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
