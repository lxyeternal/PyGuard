  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports describe the code as a simple import statement: `from .main import hello`. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. The code's purpose is to import a function or object named `hello` from a local module `main`. This is a common pattern in Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Anomalies**  \n- No report indicates any anomalies such as suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or data flows are involved.\n- The code is minimal and standard.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Errors in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign.\n- The confidence levels are high, and the conclusions correctly state that the code is harmless.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly very low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable since a simple import doesn't pose a security threat.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Justification**  \n- Since the code is just an import statement, the malware risk is essentially zero.\n- No suspicious behavior, no external data, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious intent.\n\n6. **Any Claims Based on Assumptions?**  \n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions and rely on the code's simplicity.\n- No unwarranted suspicion is present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n- The high confidence levels support the conclusion that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, since the code is entirely benign)\n\n### Summary:\nThis code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no malicious or suspicious characteristics. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious features.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code, aligning with the detailed analysis.",
