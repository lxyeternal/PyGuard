  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports describe a simple import statement: `from .main import hello`. This is a standard Python relative import, typical in package development. The code does not perform any operations beyond importing a function or object named `hello` from a local module `main`.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Anomalies**  \n- No report indicates any suspicious or malicious code behavior.  \n- No anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are identified.  \n- The code is minimal and straightforward, with no data flows, network activity, or external interactions.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- All reports assign very low security risk (`0.1` or `0`) and malware scores (`0`).  \n- Confidence levels are high (`1.0` or `0.9`), consistent with the simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Potential for Malicious Behavior**  \n- Since the code only imports a function/object, it cannot be malicious on its own.  \n- No signs of obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.  \n- The reports correctly conclude benign intent.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores**  \n- The malware scores are appropriately zero, given the code's simplicity.  \n- The obfuscated scores are zero, matching the lack of obfuscation.  \n- The security risk scores are minimal, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**  \n- Without context on what `hello` does, it's impossible to assess if its usage later might introduce risks. But based solely on this snippet, there's no indication of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a straightforward import statement, no issues found.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct, no obfuscation).\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0, as the minimal code carries negligible risk, consistent with the reports.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- No changes needed; the scores are appropriate.\n- If future code uses `hello` in a risky way, reassessment would be necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.**",
