  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'hello' from a module called 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local package/module 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only an import statement; no source-to-sink flow is indicated.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only performing an import; no suspicious or unusual code structures detected. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement, importing 'hello' from a relative module 'main'. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or other actions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or anomalies. Given the limited code, the security risk is minimal. Without additional context, it appears to be a standard import statement in a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, performing a simple import. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security issues in this minimal code.",
