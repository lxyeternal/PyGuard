  "purpose": "Import a function 'hello' from a local module 'main' within the package.",
  "sources": "Relative import statement 'from .main import hello'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only imports a symbol; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import, common in Python packages. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, network activity, or obfuscation. The import is standard and benign. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and the scores justified. No modifications are necessary.",
