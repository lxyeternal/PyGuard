{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'hello' function or object from the local 'main' module, likely for execution or further use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.main)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the import itself does not handle untrusted data or perform actions",
  "flows": "Import from '.main' to current module context; no data flow to external systems or outputs",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a relative import is typical in package development; no suspicious or unusual code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement from a relative module, which is standard in Python package development. No input handling, no execution of untrusted code, no network connections, and no data leaks are evident. The import is from the local package, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. This minimal code fragment does not pose security risks or indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a standard import from a local module, and shows no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
