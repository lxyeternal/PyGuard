{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'algorithms-infinity' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function: package name, version, author info, description, packages, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted input or lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code is purely declarative configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The email address appears legitimate. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging. It specifies package metadata, requirements, and packages to include. No user input, no environment variable usage, and no suspicious functions or code paths. It does not perform any malicious actions or contain hidden behavior. The script is straightforward and typical for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
