{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata for a Python project using setuptools in a standard setup script.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields: name, version, author, author_email, description, and an empty install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is read from external sources or written to untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static configuration without dynamic input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and conventional with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools to specify package metadata. It contains no dynamic code, no network calls, no data processing, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The dependencies list is empty, indicating no external dependencies are introduced. The author information appears legitimate, and the code structure is standard. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports (0.1) is a conservative default, but given the static and benign nature of the code, a score of 0 is more accurate. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign appropriate malware and obfuscation scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 for an accurate assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
