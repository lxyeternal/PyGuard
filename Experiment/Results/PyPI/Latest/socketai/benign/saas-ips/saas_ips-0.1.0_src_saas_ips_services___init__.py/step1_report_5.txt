  "purpose": "Importing various service-specific classes or modules for integration or SDK purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (e.g., .atlassian, .azure, etc.).",
  "sinks": "None directly present; no external data handling or untrusted data sinks shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed in this snippet; only import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for classes or modules related to services like Atlassian, Azure, Box, Fastly, Google, and O365. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The structure and format are straightforward. Without additional context, these imports appear standard for SDK or API integrations. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or anomalies are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a typical set of import statements for service modules, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
