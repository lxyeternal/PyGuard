  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe only import statements from local modules related to various third-party services.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, data handling, or obfuscated code is present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, suspicious patterns, or malicious payloads are detected.\n- The code snippets are straightforward and typical for modular SDK or API integration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is just import statements with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  **No.** The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign 0, consistent with the code being straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All assign 0, which aligns with the minimal, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign scores above 0.5, which is correct. The code is purely import statements, with no indications of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code only imports modules and does not execute any code, read untrusted input, or perform network operations, there is no basis for higher risk or malware scores.\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities based solely on import statements.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese are appropriate given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a standard, safe module import pattern with no security concerns.",
