{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from local modules related to various service providers, serving as setup or initialization code within a package.",
  "sources": "The import statements themselves are the sources; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports without runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from local modules, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. The imports are from modules named after well-known service providers, likely for modular integration. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The simplicity and clarity of the code strongly suggest benign intent. Given the absence of any suspicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation, the code is considered safe. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements for modular setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and should remain at zero.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
