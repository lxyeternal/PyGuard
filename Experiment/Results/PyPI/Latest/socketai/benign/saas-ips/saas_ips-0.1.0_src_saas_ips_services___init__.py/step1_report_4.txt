{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to various third-party service integrations, likely for an application that interacts with these services.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules: atlassian, azure, box, fastly, google, o365",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data or untrusted input handling shown",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; only module imports, no data processing or transmission",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import statements without obfuscated or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing modules from the current package. There are no functions, data handling, network operations, or executable code that could indicate malicious activity. The modules imported suggest integration with external services, but the code itself is benign. The lack of any input/output, data flow, or complex logic indicates this is likely part of a larger, standard application setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module import setup with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be standard boilerplate code for including various service integrations.",
