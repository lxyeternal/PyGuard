  "purpose": "Command-line interface for the Saas Data Collector application",
  "sources": "Import of 'fire' module and 'Collector' class from saas_ips.collector",
  "sinks": "fire.Fire(Collector) invokes the command-line interface functionality, which could process user inputs",
  "flows": "User inputs from command line are processed by 'fire.Fire', which interacts with the 'Collector' class",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious patterns observed. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'fire' for CLI creation and the 'Collector' class. The main function initializes the CLI with 'fire.Fire(Collector)', enabling command-line interaction with the Collector class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a standard CLI bootstrap script. The only potential concern is the behavior of the 'Collector' class itself, but that is outside the scope of this script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point utilizing 'fire' to expose the 'Collector' class. No malicious intent, suspicious patterns, or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
