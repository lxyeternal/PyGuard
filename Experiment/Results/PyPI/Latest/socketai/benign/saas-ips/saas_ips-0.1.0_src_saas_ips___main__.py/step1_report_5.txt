{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for the Saas Data Collector using the Fire library.",
  "sources": "Imports 'fire' and the 'Collector' class from 'saas_ips.collector'.",
  "sinks": "Invokes 'fire.Fire' with the 'Collector' class, which may instantiate it and call its methods based on command-line input.",
  "flows": "User input via command-line arguments is processed by 'fire.Fire', which calls methods on 'Collector'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. No evidence of malicious behavior or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly sets up a CLI interface using 'fire' to expose 'Collector' class methods. There are no embedded or hidden behaviors, no network calls, and no data leaks evident in this snippet. Usage of third-party 'fire' library is standard for CLI apps. The structure and imports are typical and do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI entry point for the 'saas_ips' data collection module. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected in this code segment.",
