  "purpose": "Provide a command-line interface for the Saas Data Collector module using the Fire library.",
  "sources": "Importing 'fire' library and 'Collector' class from saas_ips.collector module.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of fire.Fire(Collector), which runs the Collector class as CLI entry point.",
  "flows": "Code imports libraries, then calls fire.Fire with Collector, which initializes and runs the CLI interface.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports the 'fire' library for CLI handling and a 'Collector' class from a local module. The main function invokes fire.Fire with Collector, setting up the CLI interface. There are no input/output data flows involving untrusted sources within this snippet, nor any suspicious or malicious code. The code appears to be a simple CLI wrapper around the Collector class, with standard structure. No signs of malware, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic CLI wrapper for the 'Collector' class using the 'fire' library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks based on this snippet. The code appears to be legitimate and safe.",
