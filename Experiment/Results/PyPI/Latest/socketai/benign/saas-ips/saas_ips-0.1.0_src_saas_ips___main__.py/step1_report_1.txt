  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for the Saas Data Collector using the Fire library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'fire' and 'Collector' class from 'saas_ips.collector'.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of 'fire.Fire' with 'Collector', which may instantiate and execute code from the 'Collector' class.",
  "flows": "The script initializes 'fire.Fire' with 'Collector', which may process command-line input and invoke methods or data from 'Collector'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. Usage of 'fire' for CLI is common. No obfuscated or malicious code features present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports the 'fire' library for CLI creation and the 'Collector' class from a module. The 'main' function runs 'fire.Fire' with 'Collector' as the argument, enabling CLI commands based on 'Collector' methods. The script includes a standard 'if __name__ == \"__main__\"' guard to execute 'main'. No external data sources, sinks, or risky operations are visible. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The structure is clean, and the code serves a typical CLI purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard CLI entry point for the 'Collector' class, with no suspicious or malicious elements detected. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
