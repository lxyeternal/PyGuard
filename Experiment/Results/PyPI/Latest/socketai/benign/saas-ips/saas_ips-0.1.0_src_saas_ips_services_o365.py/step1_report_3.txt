  "purpose": "Retrieve and parse IP addresses used by O365 services from a remote endpoint.",
  "sources": "The response from the HTTP request to the endpoint specified in HOST and ENDPOINT.",
  "sinks": "The response.json() call and the addition of service data to the Source object.",
  "flows": "HTTP response → response.json() → parsing loop → source.add_service()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; usage of standard libraries and straightforward API call.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches data from a specified URL endpoint related to Office 365 IPs. It parses the JSON response and adds service info to a Source object. The URL is hardcoded but appears to be a public endpoint for O365 services. The parse_response method processes the data without executing or eval, reducing risk. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious activity is detected. The only concern could be reliance on external data, but this is expected for such a service. Overall, the code performs a benign data collection function with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of an API client fetching O365 IPs. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The endpoint is public, and no sensitive data handling or unsafe code constructs are present.",
