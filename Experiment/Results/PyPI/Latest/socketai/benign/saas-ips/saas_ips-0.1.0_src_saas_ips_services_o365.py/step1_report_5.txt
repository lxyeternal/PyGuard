  "purpose": "To gather and parse IP addresses used by O365 services from a specified endpoint.",
  "sources": "response.json() after receiving HTTP response",
  "sinks": "self.__logger.debug, source.add_service",
  "flows": "response -> response.json() -> loop over services -> source.add_service",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code. Endpoint URL contains a fixed clientrequestid parameter, which appears static but is part of URL; not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to fetch data from a fixed URL endpoint and parse JSON response to extract IPs associated with O365 services. It logs debugging information and populates a Source object with service details and IP addresses. There is no indication of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. The static URL and parameters are typical for API calls. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No suspicious activity or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward API call to retrieve service IPs for O365 and processes the response without any malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware or security risks based on the provided code.",
