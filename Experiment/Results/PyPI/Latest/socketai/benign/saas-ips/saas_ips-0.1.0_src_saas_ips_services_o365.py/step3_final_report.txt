{
  "purpose": "Fetches and parses IP addresses used by O365 services from a public Microsoft endpoint.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to a static URL with fixed clientrequestid, response.json() parsing.",
  "sinks": "Parsing JSON data and populating the Source object; no untrusted data execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Response from the URL is parsed into JSON, then iterated to add service names and IPs to the Source object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Static URL and fixed request ID are standard for such API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a benign fetch and parse operation from a known public API endpoint. It does not execute untrusted code, write to disk, or perform network exfiltration. The static URL and fixed clientrequestid are typical for API requests and do not indicate malicious intent. The JSON response is safely parsed and used to populate data structures. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting reliance on external data but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation for retrieving O365 IPs. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
