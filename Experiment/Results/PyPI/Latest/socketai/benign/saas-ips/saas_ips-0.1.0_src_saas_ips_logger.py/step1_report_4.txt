{
  "purpose": "Provides a logging utility with color formatting and a metaclass for automatic logger assignment in classes.",
  "sources": "Imports standard logging modules, reads configuration data, class definitions, and method implementations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks observed; logging outputs to console and files using standard logging handlers.",
  "flows": "Logging configuration is set globally; logger instances are created per class via metaclass, and formatted logs are output to console/file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Logging configuration appears standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging setup with color formatting and a metaclass that assigns a logger to classes based on their inheritance hierarchy. It uses standard logging practices, including handlers, formatters, and configuration. The CustomFormatter adds color output, and DebugFileHandler selectively logs debug level records to files. The LoggingBase metaclass automatically attaches a logger to classes, facilitating consistent logging. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or sabotage mechanisms. Overall, the implementation is straightforward, utilizing standard libraries and patterns without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility with a metaclass for logger assignment. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. It functions as intended to enhance logging capabilities without introducing security concerns.",
