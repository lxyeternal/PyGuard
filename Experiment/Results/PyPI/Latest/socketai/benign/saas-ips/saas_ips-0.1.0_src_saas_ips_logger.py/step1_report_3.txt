{
  "purpose": "Provides logging utilities, including a custom formatter, a file handler, and a metaclass for injecting loggers into classes.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary LOGGING_CONFIG, CustomFormatter class, DebugFileHandler class, LoggingBase metaclass constructor.",
  "sinks": "Logging configuration application, logger creation and assignment.",
  "flows": "LOGGING_CONFIG is used to configure loggers, CustomFormatter formats logs, DebugFileHandler writes debug logs to file, LoggingBase assigns a logger to classes via metaclass.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. No code executes external commands or reads untrusted input. Loggers are configured internally, with no evident malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a structured logging system with color-coded console output and conditional debug file logging. The LoggingBase metaclass assigns loggers to classes based on their inheritance chain, facilitating consistent logging. All components use standard Python logging mechanisms, with no dynamic code execution or data exfiltration observed. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate logging utility implementation, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It sets up a configurable logging system and injects loggers into classes in a standard manner.",
