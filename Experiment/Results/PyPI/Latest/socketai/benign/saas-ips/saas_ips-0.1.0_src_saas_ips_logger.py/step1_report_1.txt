  "purpose": "Provide a structured logging system with custom formatting and a metaclass for easy logger access in classes.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary LOGGING_CONFIG; class initialization methods; format method in CustomFormatter; emit method in DebugFileHandler; __init__ method in LoggingBase.",
  "sinks": "Logging output via console and file handlers; potential exposure of logs if improperly secured; logger attribute in classes.",
  "flows": "Logging configuration dict -> logging setup in LoggingBase.__init__ -> logger attribute access via self.__logger in classes -> logs formatted by CustomFormatter -> logs written to console/file by handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code present. The code uses standard logging practices and formatting with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging setup with a configuration dict, custom color-coded formatter, a specialized debug file handler, and a metaclass to assign loggers to classes. The formatter applies color codes based on log level, enhancing readability. The DebugFileHandler only logs DEBUG level messages, and the LoggingBase class injects a logger attribute into classes. All components use standard Python logging features without any suspicious code or external dependencies. The code appears to be designed for debugging and development purposes only, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured logging utility with no malicious intent. It facilitates colored console logs and per-class loggers using a metaclass. There are no indications of malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks.",
