  "purpose": "Provides a structured logging setup with custom color formatting, a specialized file handler, and a metaclass that injects a private logger attribute into classes for consistent logging.",
  "sources": "Logging configuration dict, formatter class, file handler, and metaclass constructor that sets a logger attribute based on class hierarchy.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs to console and files; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration dict -> formatter and handler -> metaclass assigns logger to class -> class methods use __logger to log messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Python logging practices with a custom color formatter and a metaclass that assigns a private logger attribute to classes. The formatter applies color codes based on log level, and the custom file handler logs only DEBUG level messages. The metaclass constructs a logger name based on class hierarchy and assigns it as a private attribute. No external network activity, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to common logging patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security flaws are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured logging utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior. The minimal risk score accounts for potential log exposure if misconfigured but is not indicative of a security threat.",
