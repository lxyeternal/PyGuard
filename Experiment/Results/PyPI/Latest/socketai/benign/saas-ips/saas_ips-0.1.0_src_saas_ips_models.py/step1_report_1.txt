{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for managing and validating IP addresses, services, sources, and known IP collections in a SaaS Data Collector system.",
  "sources": "Input data includes IP address strings for validation and adding to services within sources.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; validation occurs during IP creation, and data is stored in data structures.",
  "flows": "Input IP strings flow through IP validation in the IP class constructor, then are stored within Service and Source objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Validation correctly catches invalid IPs; no use of unsafe dynamic code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on defining data structures with validation for IP addresses. The IP class employs standard ipaddress validation with proper error handling. The add_service method manages service and IP addition logically, with no dynamic execution or unsafe operations. No network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to serve its intended purpose of modeling data without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data model with IP validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It functions solely to manage data structures securely.",
