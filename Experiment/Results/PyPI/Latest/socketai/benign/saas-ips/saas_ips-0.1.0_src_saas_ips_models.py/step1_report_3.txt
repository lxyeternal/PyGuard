  "purpose": "Define data models for handling IP addresses, services, sources, and known IPs in a SaaS Data Collector.",
  "sources": "The IP class reads IP address strings; the add_service method reads 'name', 'ips', and optional 'region' parameters.",
  "sinks": "The IP validation attempts to parse and validate IP addresses; the add_service method appends IP objects to service lists.",
  "flows": "IP string inputs are validated in IP.validate_ip; IPs are added to services via add_service, which creates IP objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The use of ipaddress for validation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes with validation for IP addresses using ipaddress library. The IP class ensures IP validity upon instantiation. The Service, Source, and KnownIPs classes organize data. The add_service method manages service and IP lists properly, with no evident malicious logic or obfuscation. No external data transmission, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for modeling sources and IPs, with proper validation. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious activities.",
