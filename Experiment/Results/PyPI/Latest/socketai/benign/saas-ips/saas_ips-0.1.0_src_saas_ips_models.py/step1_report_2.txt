  "purpose": "Define data models for IP addresses, services, and sources in a SaaS Data Collector system.",
  "sources": "Input data for IP addresses, service names, source names, and URLs via class instantiation and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Validation of IP addresses in the IP class, appending IPs and services to internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Input data (IP strings, service names, URLs) flow into object creation and method calls; IP validation occurs during IP object instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "IP validation uses ipaddress library without any suspicious or malicious code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several data models with validation logic primarily for IP address correctness. The IP class performs IP address validation upon instantiation, ensuring only valid IPv4 or IPv6 addresses are accepted. The add_service method in the Source class manages the addition of services and their IPs, including handling both list and single string inputs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code flows. The code appears standard and designed for data modeling without any external or hidden malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a straightforward data model setup with validation for IP addresses. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. It operates as intended for data collection purposes without security risks.",
