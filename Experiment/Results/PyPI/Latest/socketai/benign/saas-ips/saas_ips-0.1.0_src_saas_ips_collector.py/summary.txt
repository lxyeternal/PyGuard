  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data collection utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal security risk score reflects the code's simplicity. External dependencies should be trusted or audited separately, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe."
