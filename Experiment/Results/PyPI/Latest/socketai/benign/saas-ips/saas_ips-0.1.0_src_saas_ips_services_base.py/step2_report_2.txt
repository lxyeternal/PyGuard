  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The report concludes that the code is a standard, well-structured HTTP base class with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is low (0.2).  \n- **Assessment:** The code does not process user input directly into request URLs or headers; configuration is external and controlled. The abstract method `parse_response()` could introduce risks if improperly implemented, but within this fragment, no malicious activity is evident.  \n- **Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard structure, no malicious intent, and proper handling. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Same reasoning applies. No signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Reiterates the standard design, with configuration-driven requests, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues identified.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no malicious activity or obfuscation, standard request handling. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, the code is a typical HTTP request wrapper with no signs of malicious activity. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues here either.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious behavior or code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's nature as a standard HTTP request class with no direct handling of untrusted data or dynamic code execution, the low risk scores (0.1-0.2) are appropriate.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- The code appears safe, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk issues.  \n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to external configuration reliance, which is standard)\n\n**Final note:** The abstract method `parse_response()` could be a vector if subclasses implement malicious parsing, but that is outside the scope of this fragment. As it stands, the code is secure and well-structured.",
