  "purpose": "Definition of a base class for services and endpoints, inheriting from LoggingBase.",
  "sources": "Import of saas_ips.logger.LoggingBase",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "Import from saas_ips.logger -> inheritance from LoggingBase",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a class with minimal code and a class attribute _TEST set to None; no suspicious or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a logger base class and defines an empty class inheriting from it. The class contains a single class attribute '_TEST' initialized to None. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present. The minimal code appears to be a standard base class setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple base class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger framework and contains no malicious or suspicious code.",
