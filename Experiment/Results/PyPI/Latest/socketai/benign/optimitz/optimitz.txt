      "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, safe, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. It is a standard implementation of genetic algorithm components suitable for deployment. The minimal security risk score of approximately 0.1 reflects the inherent probabilistic nature of such algorithms but does not indicate actual malicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly likely benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks detected. The scores across all reports are consistent with their analyses. To improve accuracy, security risk scores can be further lowered to zero if no additional context indicates residual risk. Overall, the assessments are justified and appropriate given the information provided."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate optimization framework with no signs of malicious activity. The primary security concern is the potential execution of arbitrary code via pickle deserialization if untrusted files are loaded. No backdoors, sabotage, or obfuscation are detected."
