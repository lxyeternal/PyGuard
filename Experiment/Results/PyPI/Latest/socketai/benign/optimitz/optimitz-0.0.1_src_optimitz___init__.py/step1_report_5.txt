{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a standard Python module or script possibly intended for general data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, local variables, and possibly from external inputs such as files or network if included in omitted parts.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network transmissions, or file writes if present in the code, but no explicit sinks are identified in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters, file reads, network reads) to processing functions, and potentially to output or system effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are visible in the provided code snippet. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward, with standard function definitions and data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, is not inherently suspicious. Without additional context or code, there are no indicators of malicious intent. The structure and format are conventional, and no unusual or obfuscated patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, benign Python script or module. The confidence level is high due to lack of suspicious patterns and anomalies.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
