  "conclusion": "The code is highly likely benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks detected. The scores across all reports are consistent with their analyses. To improve accuracy, security risk scores can be further lowered to zero if no additional context indicates residual risk. Overall, the assessments are justified and appropriate given the information provided."
