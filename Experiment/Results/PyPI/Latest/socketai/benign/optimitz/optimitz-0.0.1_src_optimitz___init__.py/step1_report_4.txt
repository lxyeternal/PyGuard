  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or interaction, but the exact intent is unclear due to lack of comments and structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user input, environment variables, and possibly external modules or APIs (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or system commands that could lead to data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (network, file, or system commands).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual features include dynamically executed code (e.g., eval or exec), hardcoded credentials, obfuscated variables, or unnecessary dynamic imports. No such anomalies detected in the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code, as provided, is minimal and contains no evident malicious constructs. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity was observed. The code's structure appears straightforward, with no evident malicious flow or backdoors. Lack of comments or documentation limits full understanding, but based on the visible content, no malicious behavior is identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. It appears benign, with no suspicious data flows or anomalous features detected. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
