  "purpose": "Implementation of solution classes and genetic operators for optimization algorithms, including encoding, mutation, crossover, and entropy calculations.",
  "sources": "Data inputs via method parameters, class attributes, and random number generators.",
  "sinks": "Internal data flow; no external network, file I/O, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows through encode/decode/mutate/cross functions within the class methods, influenced by randomness.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious routines detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of genetic algorithm components, utilizing common libraries (numpy, bitarray). No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. Usage of randomness and data encoding is typical for such algorithms. No signs of obfuscation or sabotage. The design aligns with typical optimization libraries, and no suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, safe, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. It is a standard implementation of genetic algorithm components suitable for deployment. The minimal security risk score of approximately 0.1 reflects the inherent probabilistic nature of such algorithms but does not indicate actual malicious behavior.",
