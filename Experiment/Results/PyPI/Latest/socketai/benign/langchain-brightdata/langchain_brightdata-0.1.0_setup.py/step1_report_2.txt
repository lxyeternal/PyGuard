{
  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for the 'langchain-brightdata' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; specifies static package information and dependencies.",
  "targets": "No untrusted input or data handling; setup parameters are static and predefined.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to configure a Python package. It reads a README file for description and specifies dependencies with fixed version constraints. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no suspicious code behavior, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The dependencies listed are common packages and appear to be standard. No potential security issues or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It safely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
