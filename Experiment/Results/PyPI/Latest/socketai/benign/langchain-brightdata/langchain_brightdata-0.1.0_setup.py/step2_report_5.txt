  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a standard setup script using setuptools.\n- The code reads \"README.md\" for long_description, sets package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n- No untrusted input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, benign, and free of suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical Python packaging scripts.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Logical errors or reasoning flaws?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the code as standard and benign.\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores as 0, which seems appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports.  \n  Correct, since no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports.  \n  Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **SecurityRisk score:** 0 in all reports.  \n  Justified, no security risks are evident.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code is standard and safe.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No hidden malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The dependencies are common and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical setup script with no suspicious or malicious behavior, no data leaks, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The dependency list is standard, and the code reads a README file to include a description, which is common practice.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
