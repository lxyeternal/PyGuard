  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project with setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input from file read operation; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, benign setup script that imports setuptools, reads a markdown file for description, and calls setup() with static metadata and dependencies. No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. Dependencies are fixed and standard. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
