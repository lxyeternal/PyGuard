{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'langchain-brightdata'. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion details.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; static package metadata and dependencies specified directly in the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not include any data sinks that handle untrusted data or perform network communication.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content into 'long_description' (source) to be used in package metadata (sink). No other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior observed. The script strictly adheres to standard Python packaging practices with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for packaging, reads a markdown file for long description, and configures package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are standard for a setup script. No untrusted input, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The dependencies listed are typical libraries used in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
