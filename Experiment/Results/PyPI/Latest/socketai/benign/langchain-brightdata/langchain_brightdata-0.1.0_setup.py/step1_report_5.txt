  "purpose": "This script is used to set up and package a Python project named 'langchain-brightdata', specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long_description; static strings and function calls providing package info and dependencies.",
  "targets": "None; there are no runtime data sinks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code performs static configuration without data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for packaging, reads a markdown README for description, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are typical for a Python package setup. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious network activity are present. It solely defines package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
