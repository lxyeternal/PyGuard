  "purpose": "This script is for configuring the packaging of a Python project named 'langchain-brightdata' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; loads dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data; no data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> assigns to 'long_description'; sets package metadata and dependencies for setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard setup configuration without hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup process: opens a markdown file for description and configures package metadata. Dependencies are specified in a standard manner. No user input handling, network calls, or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It properly reads a file and defines package dependencies, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
