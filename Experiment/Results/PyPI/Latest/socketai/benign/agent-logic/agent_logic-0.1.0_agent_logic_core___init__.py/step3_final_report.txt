{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an interface that imports and re-exports core logical classes and functions from the 'agent_logic.core' package, facilitating access to logical expression components.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules: 'agent_logic.core.base', 'agent_logic.core.functions', 'agent_logic.core.operations', 'agent_logic.core.predicates', and 'agent_logic.core.quantifiers'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects; the code only performs static imports and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and functions from external modules and exposes them via the __all__ list; no runtime data flows or external interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module that imports core logical classes and functions, then defines an export list. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external communication. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, structural component with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with its nature. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic behavior support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API interface exposing logical expression classes without any malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
