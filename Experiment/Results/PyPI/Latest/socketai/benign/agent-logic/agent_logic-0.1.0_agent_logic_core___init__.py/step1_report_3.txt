{
  "purpose": "This module provides fundamental classes and operations for creating and manipulating logical expressions in propositional and predicate logic.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'agent_logic.core' submodules: base, functions, operations, predicates, quantifiers.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output; primarily class imports and definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A: The code only imports classes and defines an __all__ list; no data flow or execution logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports various classes related to logical expressions and re-exports them via __all__. There are no function calls, data processing, or network operations. The imports are from a presumably trusted package 'agent_logic.core'. The file appears to serve as an API interface or a facade for logical expression classes. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. It mainly acts as a collection point for logical expression classes and functions, with no hidden or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module that re-exports logical classes and functions. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely as an API aggregator without executing any logic or data processing.",
