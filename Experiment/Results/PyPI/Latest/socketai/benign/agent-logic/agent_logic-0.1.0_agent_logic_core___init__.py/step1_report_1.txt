{
  "purpose": "Provides fundamental classes and functions for creating and manipulating logical expressions in propositional and predicate logic.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from 'agent_logic.core' package, specifically 'base', 'functions', 'operations', 'predicates', and 'quantifiers'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or execute untrusted code. No data output, network communication, or external command execution observed.",
  "flows": "The code mainly imports classes and defines an __all__ list, without any data flow or execution logic involving external or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs detected. The code is a straightforward module interface definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from a package, then defines an explicit __all__ list for exports. There are no runtime code executions, no dynamic code, no string evaluations, and no input/output operations. It serves as a module interface or API layer, which by itself cannot perform malicious actions. It relies on external modules for logic implementation, which are not shown and cannot be evaluated here. The module appears to be a well-structured, standard import/export interface for logical expression classes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module interface that imports and exposes logical classes and functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, or anomalies indicating sabotage. It appears safe and benign.",
