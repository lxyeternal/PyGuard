{
  "purpose": "This module provides fundamental classes and operations for creating and manipulating logical expressions in propositional and predicate logic.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'agent_logic.core' modules: base, functions, operations, predicates, and quantifiers.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code primarily imports classes and defines an __all__ list.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and re-exports specific classes; no untrusted data flow or user input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports core classes and functions related to logical expressions. It defines an __all__ list for exports, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling observed. The code appears to serve as an interface or facade for logical expression classes, with no evident malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module primarily importing and exposing classes related to logical expressions. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are evident.",
