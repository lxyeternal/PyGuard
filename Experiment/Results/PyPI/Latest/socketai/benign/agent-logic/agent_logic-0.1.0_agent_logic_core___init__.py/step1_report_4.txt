{
  "purpose": "This module provides foundational classes and operations for creating and manipulating logical expressions in propositional and predicate logic, serving as a core library for logical reasoning.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'agent_logic.core' submodules: base, functions, operations, predicates, quantifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no network, file, or external data interactions.",
  "flows": "The module primarily defines class imports and exports, with no data flow or dynamic execution paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution or eval usage. The code appears to be straightforward import and export statements with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions related to logical expressions from various internal modules, and defines an __all__ list for exports. It contains no executable logic, no data handling, and no network or system calls. The code appears to serve as an interface or API module, with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security concerns. It is purely structural and organizational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for logical expressions with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured for providing core logical classes and functions, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.",
