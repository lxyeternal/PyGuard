{
  "purpose": "This module provides fundamental classes and operations for creating and manipulating logical expressions in propositional and predicate logic.",
  "sources": "Imports from agent_logic.core.* modules, specifically base, functions, operations, predicates, and quantifiers.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules into this module; no external input/output or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code appears to be a standard library setup for logical operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a structured import and export of classes related to logical expressions. It imports core classes and functions from the agent_logic package, which appears to be a logical reasoning library. There are no dynamic evaluations, network operations, or sensitive data handling. The module simply re-exports selected classes and functions for external use, with no evident malicious code or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup for a logical reasoning library, with no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It primarily organizes and exposes core logical classes and operations.",
