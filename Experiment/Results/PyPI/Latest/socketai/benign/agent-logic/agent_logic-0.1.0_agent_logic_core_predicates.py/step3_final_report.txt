  "flows": "evaluate() retrieves function from context by name -> calls it with term values.",
  "anomalies": "No validation that retrieved object is callable; potential runtime error if not.",
  "analysis": "The code models logical predicates and evaluates them via functions stored in a context dictionary. The evaluate() method assumes the context contains callables under predicate names and invokes them with term values. No external data fetching or code execution occurs directly. The main risk is if the context is untrusted and contains malicious or non-callable objects, leading to runtime errors or potential misuse. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or embedded malware. The dynamic invocation pattern is a common source of security concerns but does not inherently constitute malicious behavior. Validation of callability would improve robustness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of logical predicate modeling with evaluation via dynamic function calls. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the lack of validation that the retrieved object from the context is callable, which could lead to runtime errors or potential exploitation if the context is untrusted. Overall, the code is safe but should include validation to mitigate this risk.",
