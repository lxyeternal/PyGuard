  "purpose": "Define data models for predicate logic terms and predicates with evaluation capabilities.",
  "sources": "Input data for terms and predicates via the from_dict method and attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation method calls and data access in the evaluate method, conversion methods.",
  "flows": "from_dict constructs objects from external data; evaluate uses context data for predicate evaluation.",
  "anomalies": "The evaluate method dynamically calls a function stored in the context dictionary with predicate name as key, which could be suspicious if context contains malicious functions or data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two models, Term and Predicate, for representing logic constructs. The evaluate method retrieves a function associated with the predicate's name from the context and calls it with term values, which could be manipulated if the context is untrusted. The from_dict method constructs objects from external data, which could potentially lead to arbitrary object creation if data is malicious. No direct execution of untrusted code or system commands is present. The use of pydantic provides input validation, reducing some risk. Overall, the code is primarily data modeling with some dynamic function invocation, which could be risky if context data is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for logic modeling and does not include explicit malicious behavior. However, the evaluate method's dynamic function call based on external context introduces some risk if the context contains malicious functions or data. The rest of the code appears standard and safe for its purpose.",
