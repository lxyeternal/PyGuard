{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for logical expressions (Proposition, Not, BinaryOp and subclasses) to enable logical formula evaluation and transformation.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'agent_logic.core.base', and fields for logical expression attributes. The code reads 'context' dictionaries during evaluation.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation functions access 'context' for truth values, but do not write or send data elsewhere. No external data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'context' during evaluate() calls flows through expression trees to compute logical results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of network, file I/O, or system commands. Code structure is typical for logic expression trees.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of classes modeling logical propositions and operations, with serialization/deserialization methods. Evaluation relies solely on provided 'context' dictionary, with no external communication or side-effects. No unusual code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard logical expression framework intended for propositional logic processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of propositional logic classes for evaluation and serialization. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data flows. It appears safe and benign.",
