{
  "purpose": "This module implements classes for logical propositions and operations, allowing logical expressions to be constructed, evaluated, and serialized/deserialized.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'context' parameter in evaluate methods, and the dictionary data used for from_dict methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the evaluate methods where untrusted 'context' data is used to determine truth values, but this is standard logic evaluation; no external system interaction occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'context' input into evaluate methods for variable resolution; serialized data flows from to_dict outputs to reconstructed objects via from_dict methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code performs standard logical operations and object serialization/deserialization without any unusual patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines logical expression classes with evaluation, serialization, and deserialization functionalities. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network access, system modification, or secret data handling. The logic is straightforward, relying on standard Python features and explicit type annotations. From beginning to end, the code appears to be a benign implementation of logical formulas, with standard patterns for object serialization/deserialization. No external system calls or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of logical expression classes with serialization/deserialization capabilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and intentional for logical expression handling.",
