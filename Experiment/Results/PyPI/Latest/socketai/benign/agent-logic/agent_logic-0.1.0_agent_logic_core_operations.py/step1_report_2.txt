{
  "purpose": "Define classes for logical expressions (Proposition, Not, BinaryOps) with evaluation, serialization, and deserialization capabilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function arguments and class attributes; no external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that transmit data externally, execute system commands, or handle untrusted input. Evaluation occurs internally.",
  "flows": "No external input flows to critical sinks; data flows through class methods internally, mainly for logical evaluation and serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is purely logical and structural, with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured implementation of logical expressions with methods for evaluation, serialization, and deserialization. It uses standard Python features and type hints. There are no external calls, no network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. The from_dict methods reconstruct objects from dictionaries, which could be a vector if external untrusted data is supplied, but this is standard for serialization. Overall, the code appears benign, focused on logical modeling. No malware or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of logical expression classes with serialization support. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and solely focused on logical modeling.",
