  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for proof validation using agent_logic package",
  "sources": "Reads proof JSON files from filesystem, deserializes via Proof.from_dict()",
  "sinks": "Calls proof.is_valid() which may process data internally",
  "flows": "JSON file input -> Proof.from_dict() -> proof.is_valid() -> output validation result",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward JSON loading and method calls",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI interface that loads a JSON proof file, constructs a Proof object, and validates it. No network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration occurs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. Error handling is generic but standard. External dependencies (Proof class) are assumed safe. The code does not execute untrusted code or perform unsafe operations. Scores in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI utility for proof validation with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
