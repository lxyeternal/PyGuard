{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for validating logical proofs stored in JSON files within the agent-logic package.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from JSON proof files specified by the user.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes output messages to the console; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads proof file -> loads JSON -> creates Proof object -> validates proof -> outputs result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or suspicious code constructs. Uses external libraries normally associated with CLI tools and JSON parsing. No dynamic code execution, system calls, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI implementation: it loads a JSON proof file, constructs a Proof object, sets debug mode if specified, and checks validity. It uses standard libraries and the package's own classes. No user input beyond file path, no malicious data handling, and no network or system modifications are performed. Error handling is generic, with exceptions caught and reported to the console. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to perform a legitimate proof validation task with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility for proof validation with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not include any suspicious operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The only potential concern would be if the proof files themselves contain malicious data, but this is outside the scope of code review and pertains to input validation and trustworthiness of proof files.",
