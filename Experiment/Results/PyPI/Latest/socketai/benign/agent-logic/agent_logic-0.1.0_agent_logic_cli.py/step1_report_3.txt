{
  "purpose": "Provide a command-line interface for interacting with the agent-logic package, including proof validation.",
  "sources": "Reading user input via command-line arguments, reading proof JSON files from specified paths.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if input is used unsafely (e.g., in subprocess or eval), but in this code, data is only read from files and not executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> argument parsing -> reading JSON proof file -> proof validation via imported Proof class.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior observed. The code uses standard libraries, and the logic is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments, reads a JSON file for proof data, and validates it through the Proof class. There are no dynamic code executions, no network operations, no handling of untrusted inputs in an unsafe manner. The imported modules are used in a typical way. The code includes standard error handling and logging configuration. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures are present. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate CLI tool with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper for proof validation, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely reads data from files and invokes external, presumably safe, validation routines without executing untrusted code or transmitting data externally.",
