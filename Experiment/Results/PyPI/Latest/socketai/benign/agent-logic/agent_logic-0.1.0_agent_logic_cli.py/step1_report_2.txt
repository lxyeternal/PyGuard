{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for interacting with the agent-logic package, including proof validation.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from command-line arguments and proof JSON files.",
  "sinks": "Uses proof data loaded from JSON files, potentially for validation, and outputs results to the console.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (proof file path) are processed, proof data is loaded from file, passed to Proof.from_dict, validated, and results are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of external libraries appears standard. No suspicious dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a CLI wrapper around the agent_logic package, primarily handling argument parsing, logging setup, and invoking proof validation. It loads proof data from JSON files and calls into the Proof class for validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation. No secret or sensitive data is embedded in the code. The only external data source is the proof JSON file, which is standard for such applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI interface for proof validation with no malicious intent. It does not contain suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. The overall security risk is very low.",
