{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for interacting with the agent-logic package, including proof validation.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, loads JSON proof files from specified paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; JSON proof files are read but not executed or sent over network.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> proof file read -> proof validation methods, output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Usage is standard. No code injection points or external network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The script processes user input via command-line arguments, reads JSON files, and interacts with the agent_logic.proofs.proof_system.Proof class for validation. No malicious or suspicious code behaviors observed. No hardcoded secrets, no external data exfiltration, no network connections, and no code obfuscation. The code structure is straightforward, and all functions appear standard for a CLI tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI interface for proof validation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
