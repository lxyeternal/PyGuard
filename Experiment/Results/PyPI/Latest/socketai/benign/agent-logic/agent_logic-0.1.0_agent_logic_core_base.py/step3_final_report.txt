  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for logical expressions with serialization/deserialization and evaluation methods.",
  "sources": "The 'from_dict' method reads the 'type' field from input data to determine which subclass to instantiate.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if input data is malicious, the dynamic import could be exploited to load unintended modules.",
  "flows": "Input data with 'type' -> 'from_dict' method -> dynamic import of subclass -> instantiation of specific logical expression object.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import within 'from_dict' based on external data; no validation of 'type' against a whitelist.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard abstract base class for logical expressions, employing a common pattern of dynamic import for deserialization to handle circular dependencies. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic import could pose a minor risk if input data is untrusted, but the pattern is controlled and limited to known classes. No network activity or code injection mechanisms are evident. The overall security posture is low risk, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a slight security risk (~0.2) due to the import pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of a logical expression base class with controlled deserialization. The dynamic import pattern is typical for modular codebases and does not indicate malicious intent. No security threats or malicious behavior are detected.",
