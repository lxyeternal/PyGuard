  "purpose": "Provide a base class for logical expressions with serialization, evaluation, and variable extraction functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements (pydantic, typing), class methods (evaluate, variables, depth, to_dict, from_dict).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted input handling or output manipulation that leads to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code defines methods for expression evaluation and reconstruction from dicts, but these do not involve untrusted data processing or external network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic present. The from_dict method dynamically reconstructs objects but relies on known, benign types. No obfuscated or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an abstract base class for logical expressions, with methods to evaluate, serialize, and deserialize expressions. The from_dict method imports subclasses dynamically and constructs expression objects based on type identifiers. All data handling appears contained within expected structures. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network access, or backdoors. Usage of pydantic is for data validation, not for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of a logical expression framework. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The code performs serialization/deserialization and evaluation of logical expressions without involving external threats.",
