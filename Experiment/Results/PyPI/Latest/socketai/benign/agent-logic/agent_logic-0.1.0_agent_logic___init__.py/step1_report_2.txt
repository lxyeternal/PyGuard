{
  "purpose": "This package provides tools for propositional logic, proof validation, and logical reasoning, including logical expressions, inference rules, proof systems, truth table evaluation, and utilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it mainly imports modules and defines metadata and exports.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects, as the code does not handle external data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; it only imports modules and sets up exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code is a straightforward package initialization and import statement file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package init/module file that defines metadata (__version__), public API (__all__), and imports core components, proof systems, evaluation tools, and utilities from other modules within the 'agent_logic' package. No external data input, no network activity, no code execution, nor any suspicious constructs are present. It appears to be a well-structured, typical Python package setup file without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code. It functions solely as a package initialization script, importing and exposing logical reasoning components without any suspicious or harmful code.",
