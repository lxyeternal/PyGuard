  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard package initialization script.\n- They confirm the code only defines metadata (__version__, __all__), imports internal modules, and exposes an API.\n- No external input, network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 (or 1.0) and malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious logic:** None.\n- **Malware activity:** None.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risks:** None.\n- **Input/output or external data handling:** None.\n- **Malicious intent or supply chain attack signs:** None.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is a straightforward package initializer, exposing API components for a logical reasoning toolkit.\n- The import statements are from internal modules within the same package namespace, which is standard.\n- The module docstring and metadata are typical and do not suggest any malicious intent.\n- The reports correctly identify the absence of anomalies or malicious patterns.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct, no obfuscation)\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malware activity)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct, no security risk detected)\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code is purely an API setup with no dynamic or external code execution, the risk remains minimal.\n- The absence of any suspicious patterns, data leaks, or external dependencies that could be exploited further supports these scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided code and reports, the scores are accurate and consistent.**  \nThere is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The code is benign, serving as a package entry point.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured package initialization script with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, with no need for further security concern.",
