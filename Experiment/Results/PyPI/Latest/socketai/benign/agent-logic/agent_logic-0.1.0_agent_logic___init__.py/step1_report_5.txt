{
  "purpose": "The code defines and documents a Python package for propositional logic, including modules, classes, and functions related to logical expressions, proof validation, truth evaluation, and utilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports internal modules and defines package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data, network connections, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports modules and defines public API components.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. The code mainly consists of import statements, metadata, and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as an API initializer and does not perform any runtime logic or data processing. It only imports various modules and exposes a public API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data exfiltration. The presence of standard package metadata and structured imports suggests routine package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. It primarily sets up the API for a logical reasoning package without executing any dangerous operations.",
