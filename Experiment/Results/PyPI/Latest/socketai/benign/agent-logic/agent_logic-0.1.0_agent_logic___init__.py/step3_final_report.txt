{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main module or __init__.py for a Python package providing tools for propositional logic, proof validation, and logical reasoning. It exposes an API surface and imports internal components for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines metadata, API exports, and imports internal modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process external data or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only sets up internal module imports and API exposure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is a standard package initializer with clear structure, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python package setup script, defining version info, API exports, and importing internal modules related to logical expressions, proofs, evaluation, and utilities. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's content and structure. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected, and the code does not perform any actions that could compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured package initializer for a logical reasoning toolkit. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further security concerns are warranted.",
