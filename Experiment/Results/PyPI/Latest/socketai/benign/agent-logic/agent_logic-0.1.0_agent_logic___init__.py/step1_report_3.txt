{
  "purpose": "The code provides an API and imports modules related to propositional logic, proof validation, and logical reasoning.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources or untrusted data reads are present. The code imports from other modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sensitive sinks or data leak points are evident. No code executes external commands, network communication, or handles untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable. The code only imports modules and defines API exposure.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard package setup and import structure without suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata, public API, and imports classes/functions from internal modules related to logic, proofs, evaluation, and utilities. There are no input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The structure aligns with typical Python package initialization files. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package interface and import setup for a logic reasoning library. No malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks are apparent from this snippet.",
