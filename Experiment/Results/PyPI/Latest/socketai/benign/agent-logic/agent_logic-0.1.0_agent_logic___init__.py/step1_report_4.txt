  "purpose": "This package provides tools for propositional logic, proof validation, and logical reasoning, including logical expressions, proofs, truth tables, and utilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads module import statements, version declaration, and the list of exported symbols (__all__).",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in the provided code. No untrusted data processing, network communication, or sensitive information handling is observed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up imports and public API definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be standard package setup code with no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package module initializer, defining the package's public API and importing core classes and functions from other modules. No runtime data handling, external inputs, or sensitive operations are present. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code patterns such as dynamic code execution, network calls, or credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any obfuscated code, malware, or security vulnerabilities within the scope of this snippet.",
