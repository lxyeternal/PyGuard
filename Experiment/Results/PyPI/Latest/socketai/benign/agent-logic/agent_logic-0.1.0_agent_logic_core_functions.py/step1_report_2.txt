{
  "purpose": "Define classes representing logical functions and relations for predicate logic evaluation.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from 'context' dictionaries during evaluate methods, and class attributes such as 'name' and 'parameters'.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation methods access 'context' data; no data is written or sent externally; no external network operations.",
  "flows": "Input context data flows into evaluate methods, which then determine boolean or other output based on internal logic.",
  "anomalies": "Function's from_dict method creates a lambda that does nothing, but this appears to be a placeholder; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for logical expressions with methods for evaluation and serialization. No external network or system modifications are present. The function attribute's default lambda could be a placeholder but does not execute malicious code. Overall, the code is straightforward and designed for logical expression modeling without evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a logical expression framework without malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It reads input data from provided contexts and does not contain any suspicious or harmful operations.",
