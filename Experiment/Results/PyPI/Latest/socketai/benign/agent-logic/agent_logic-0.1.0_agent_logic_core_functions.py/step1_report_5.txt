  "purpose": "Define data models for logical functions and relations used in predicate logic, enabling evaluation and serialization.",
  "sources": "Function.evaluate() (uses context and the function attribute), Function.from_dict() (creates lambda function), Relation.evaluate() (uses context and relation name).",
  "sinks": "Function.evaluate() executes a user-provided callable, which could be malicious if the function attribute is maliciously set. Relation.evaluate() accesses a dictionary key that could be manipulated.",
  "flows": "Input data (context, relation parameters) flows into evaluate methods, with potential execution via user-supplied function in Function class.",
  "anomalies": "The Function class assigns a default lambda function (`lambda *args: None`) during deserialization, which does not perform malicious activity but could be a placeholder. The evaluate method's use of a callable stored in the class is a potential concern if untrusted code is assigned to `function`. Otherwise, code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, Function and Relation, for logical expressions. Function class allows dynamic evaluation via a stored callable, which could be malicious if set to malicious code. However, in normal use, this is just a placeholder lambda. The from_dict method assigns a no-op lambda, preventing execution of arbitrary code during deserialization. The Relation class evaluates a predicate based on a provided context, with no direct code execution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The design appears safe assuming that the function attribute is assigned safely and not from untrusted sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides models for logical functions and relations with evaluation methods. There is a potential risk if external code assigns malicious callables to the Function's `function` attribute, but the default deserialization uses a harmless lambda. Overall, there is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The code is safe under normal circumstances.",
