  "purpose": "Defines classes for logical functions and relations with evaluation and serialization methods.",
  "sources": "Input context for function parameters; class attributes for name and parameters.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation methods accessing context data; potential for external assignment of malicious callables to 'function' attribute.",
  "flows": "Input context -> evaluate() -> context.get() or function call.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder lambda in from_dict method ('lambda *args: None') indicating incomplete deserialization; no actual malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code models logical expressions with classes 'Function' and 'Relation'. 'Function' stores a callable, evaluated with context data. The 'from_dict' method assigns a dummy lambda, which is harmless but indicates incomplete serialization. No external system calls, network activity, or data leaks are present. The primary concern is potential misuse if external code assigns malicious functions, but this is a general risk, not specific to this code. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with minor concern over incomplete deserialization logic. Overall, the code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe implementation of logical expression models. The only minor issue is the placeholder lambda in 'from_dict', which does not pose a security threat. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0, and the risk score should be low (~0.1), reflecting the incomplete serialization but no active malicious behavior.",
