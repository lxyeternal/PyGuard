  "purpose": "Define classes for representing and evaluating functions and predicate relations in logical expressions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for evaluate methods, class attribute values, data loaded via from_dict methods.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation functions that use context dictionaries for lookups, potentially allowing injection if context is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input data from context is used directly in evaluation functions, which could be manipulated if context is untrusted.",
  "anomalies": "The lambda function in from_dict creates a function that does nothing (lambda *args: None), which is benign but may be a placeholder; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected; no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data classes for functions and relations with evaluation methods. The evaluate methods depend on external context dictionaries for input, which could be manipulated but is typical for such patterns. The from_dict method for Function creates a no-op lambda, possibly a placeholder, but does not execute external code or perform malicious actions. The code appears to be standard for logical expression modeling, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no external communications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of logical expression components, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. The only minor concern is the placeholder lambda in from_dict, which does not pose security issues. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
