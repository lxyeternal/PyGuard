  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for logging, including retrieving a logger and setting the global log level, to be used throughout the logic package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions from the 'logger' module",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communications",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward utility module with standard import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports two functions from a local 'logger' module and exposes them via __all__. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs. The comments indicate intended use for logging utilities. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present. The structure and content are typical for a utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a straightforward utility interface for logging functions without any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
