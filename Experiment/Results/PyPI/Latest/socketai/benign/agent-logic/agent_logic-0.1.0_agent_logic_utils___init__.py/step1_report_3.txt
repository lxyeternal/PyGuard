  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for logging configuration within the logic package",
  "sources": "Imports from the local 'logger' module",
  "sinks": "None identified; no handling of untrusted input or data processing",
  "flows": "N/A; code mainly imports and defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; no suspicious functions or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module that imports functions from a local logger module and exposes them via __all__. There are no input sources, data processing, or network operations. It appears to serve as a simple interface for logging utilities. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility module primarily for organizing and exposing logging functions. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
