  "purpose": "Utility module providing logging configuration and helpers for the logic package.",
  "sources": "Importing functions from .logger module",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external interactions present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only importing and exporting functions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utilities module that imports two functions from a local logger module and exposes them for external use. There are no input sources, data handling, or external interactions. The code appears to be a standard, minimal setup for utility functions related to logging. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module that sets up logging helpers with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
