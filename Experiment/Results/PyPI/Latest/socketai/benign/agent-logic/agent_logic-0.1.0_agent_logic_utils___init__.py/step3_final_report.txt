{
  "purpose": "Utility module for logging functions, importing and exposing get_logger and set_global_log_level.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local logger module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; purely import/export",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; import functions are static",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export with no suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports two functions from a local logger module and exposes them via __all__. It contains no data input, output, network communication, or complex logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The code's benign nature is consistent with its purpose as a utility interface. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected. The minimal security risk stems from the import of functions that could read environment variables, but this is standard and not inherently risky.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a security risk score at 0, indicating no significant threat.",
