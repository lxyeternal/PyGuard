  "purpose": "Provide logging utilities for configuring and managing loggers within the 'logic' package.",
  "sources": "Reading function parameters (name, level), importing modules, accessing logger attributes, and environment variables (via sys.stdout).",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not output untrusted data to external systems or perform actions that could leak sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to functions -> logger configuration -> log message formatting and output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code simply manages logging configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to create and configure loggers with standard formatting, and to set the global log level. It uses standard Python logging mechanisms without executing untrusted code or performing network operations. No obfuscated language features or unnecessary dynamic execution are present. The code relies on well-known modules (logging, sys). It does not handle sensitive data, nor does it write data externally in an insecure manner. There are no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for inclusion in a larger project. No suspicious or malicious actions are present.",
