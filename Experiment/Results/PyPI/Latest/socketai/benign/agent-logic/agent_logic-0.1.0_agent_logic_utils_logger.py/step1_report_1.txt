{
  "purpose": "Provide logging utilities for configuring and managing loggers within the 'logic' package.",
  "sources": "Reading module name, logging level, and sys.stdout for stream handler configuration.",
  "sinks": "Log messages may be written to stdout; no untrusted data sinks evident beyond standard logging behavior.",
  "flows": "Input data (logger name, level) flows into logger configuration; log messages flow through handlers to output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual control flow. No obfuscation detected. Usage of standard library modules in a typical manner.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to create and configure loggers with consistent formatting, setting levels, and attaching handlers. It sets the default level if not specified, adds a stream handler writing to stdout, and provides a function to set the global log level for the 'logic' namespace. No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code relies solely on standard logging practices. It does not perform any network operations, data collection, or privilege escalation. The code appears to be a straightforward utility module for logging configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging utility module with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It employs standard logging practices without hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code. Overall security risk is very low.",
