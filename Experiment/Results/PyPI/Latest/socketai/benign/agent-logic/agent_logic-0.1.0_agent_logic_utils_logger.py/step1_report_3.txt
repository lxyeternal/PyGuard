  "purpose": "Provide and configure logging utilities for the 'logic' package, ensuring consistent logging behavior across modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements (logging, sys, typing), function parameters (name, level), internal logger creation, environment variables or external inputs for logging level (not used here).",
  "sinks": "None detected. The code writes logs to stdout via StreamHandler; no untrusted data is written to files or network destinations.",
  "flows": "Logger configuration from get_logger() -> use in application code -> log messages emitted; set_global_log_level() adjusts log levels for 'logic' namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. The code performs standard logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for creating and configuring loggers with standard formatting and allows changing the global log level. It uses safe, standard Python logging practices without any external inputs influencing its behavior maliciously. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior. The logging setup is conventional, with no obfuscated or unusual code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs safe, standard operations related to logging configuration.",
