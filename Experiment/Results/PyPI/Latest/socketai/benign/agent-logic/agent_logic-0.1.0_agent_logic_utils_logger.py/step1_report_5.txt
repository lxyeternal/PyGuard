{
  "purpose": "Provides logging utilities for the 'logic' package, enabling consistent logging configuration and control over log levels.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function arguments ('name' and 'level'), environment (imported modules), and system streams (sys.stdout).",
  "sinks": "The code writes log messages to sys.stdout via StreamHandler, and sets logger levels which could influence logging behavior. No data leaks or external data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('name', 'level') influence logger creation and configuration. 'set_global_log_level' updates logger levels, affecting subsequent logging behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code follows standard logging setup patterns. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The module sets up and manages logging configurations for the 'logic' package. It creates loggers with specified or default levels, attaches handlers that output to stdout, and provides a function to change log levels globally. No data processing, external data input, or network activity occurs. The code appears to be straightforward and intended for utility purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It manages logger creation and configuration safely without external data influence or malicious intent.",
