  "purpose": "Provides logging utilities for consistent logger creation and configuration within the 'logic' package, including setting global log levels.",
  "sources": "Logger creation functions, configuration calls, and setting log levels; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Logging output directed to sys.stdout via StreamHandler; no untrusted data sinks or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Logger creation and configuration flows; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, standard, and lacks obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python logging practices, creating loggers with consistent formatting, attaching stream handlers, and providing a function to set global log levels. It does not handle user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is utility-based, and it aligns with common, safe patterns. No vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns are identified. The reports correctly assess the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0 to 0.1). Given the code's simplicity and safety, the security risk score should be set to 0 for accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate; the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0. No further action is necessary.",
