{
  "purpose": "This code provides logging utilities for the 'logic' package, enabling consistent logger creation and global log level configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments (name, level) and environment variables (via sys.stdout if no handlers are set).",
  "targets": "The code outputs logs to sys.stdout through the logging.StreamHandler; no untrusted data is directly written to external resources.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (name, level) influence logger configuration; logs generated by the logger are formatted and sent to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for creating and configuring loggers with standard Python logging practices. It uses optional parameters for flexible configuration, sets default log levels, and manages handlers appropriately. The get_logger function ensures each logger has a StreamHandler writing to stdout, with consistent formatting. The set_global_log_level function adjusts the log level for the 'logic' logger and the module-level logger, affecting all subsequent logs. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The logging configuration is typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It responsibly manages loggers and levels without exposing or leaking sensitive data. The overall security risk is negligible.",
