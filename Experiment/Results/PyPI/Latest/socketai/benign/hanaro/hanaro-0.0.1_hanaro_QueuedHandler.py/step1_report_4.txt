{
  "purpose": "Custom logging handler that queues log records for later retrieval.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only processes log records generated within the program.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data outside the process; it only stores log records in an internal queue.",
  "flows": "Logging records emitted via emit() are placed into the internal queue; getLogRecord() retrieves records from the queue.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The class uses standard Python logging and queue modules without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging handler that queues log records in a thread-safe manner. The emit method adds log records to the queue, and getLogRecord retrieves them non-blockingly. There are no external data inputs, network communications, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be a standard implementation for asynchronous logging. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a straightforward thread-safe logging queue without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a utility class for handling logs asynchronously, with no signs of malware or security concerns.",
