  "purpose": "This module appears to be a package initialization file that imports and exposes various utilities, filters, handlers, and configuration functions for use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .utils, .ConfigFilter, .ContextInjectionFilter, .QueuedHandler, and the entire utils module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are evident; all imports are from internal modules or defined within the package.",

  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package __init__.py that imports and exposes components. There are no input handling, no data processing, no network activity, or dynamic code execution. It adheres to standard Python packaging practices. No anomalies or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves to organize and expose internal modules for external use.",
