{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package __init__.py file, setting metadata, importing internal modules, and defining exports for a Python package.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; imports are from internal modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only initializes package components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard import and export statements, no obfuscation or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package initializer with static metadata and internal imports. No dynamic code, network activity, or external data handling is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The structure and content are standard, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package __init__.py file with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
