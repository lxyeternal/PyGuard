{
  "purpose": "Define custom logging filter settings based on source and log level thresholds",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary passed to ConfigFilter during initialization",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not write untrusted data or perform external communications",
  "flows": "Configuration data is used to determine whether log records are filtered based on source and level",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious functions or behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes to filter log records based on predefined settings. It initializes filter settings from a configuration dictionary, associating log sources with minimum levels. The filter method evaluates each log record against these settings, allowing or blocking the record accordingly. The implementation uses standard Python logging constructs without any external or network operations, code injection, or data leaks. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe implementation of a logging filter with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
