  "purpose": "Define custom logging filter based on configuration settings for different sources and log levels.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration dictionary in __init__ methods to set log source and level; accessing record attributes in filter method.",
  "sinks": "Filtering logs based on source and level; no data sinks that handle untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "Configuration data -> _ConfigFilterSettings instances -> filter method evaluates record attributes against settings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code performs standard logging filter operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for filtering logs based on source and level, utilizing safe attribute access and standard Python logging practices. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leakage. The code is straightforward and intended for configuring logging behavior, with no external network activity or unsafe code. The use of getattr for level retrieval is standard and safe. Overall, the implementation appears benign and typical for a logging filter configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging filter setup that does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It filters logs based on configuration settings without any suspicious or malicious operations.",
