  "purpose": "Define a custom logging filter to control log levels per source",
  "sources": "Initialization of logging filter settings from a provided configuration dictionary",
  "sinks": "The filter method compares log record levels to source-specific levels; no external untrusted data flow or data leaks",
  "flows": "Config data flows from constructor to filter method where it influences log record filtering",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and standard for logging customization",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class and a logging filter class. The configuration class stores source and level info, defaulting to DEBUG if not specified. The filter class applies these settings during log filtering. No untrusted input handling, data leakage, or malicious patterns are observed. It is purely for log filtering based on predefined configurations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging filter implementation with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It solely manages log levels per source, which is common in logging setups.",
