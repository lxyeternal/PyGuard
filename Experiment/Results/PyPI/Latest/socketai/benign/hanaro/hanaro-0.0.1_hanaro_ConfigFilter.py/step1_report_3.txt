  "purpose": "Define custom logging filter based on source-specific level settings.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration data for log levels from a dictionary during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Filtering log records based on source and level; no data leaks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Configuration data -> Initialization of _ConfigFilterSettings objects -> Filtering log records based on source and level thresholds.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging filter that filters log records based on source-specific level thresholds. It uses configuration data to set levels, maps source names to logging levels, and applies filtering in the filter() method. No input/output, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears straightforward and adheres to standard practices, with no signs of malicious behavior or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a configurable logging filter with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It serves to control logging verbosity per source and appears benign.",
