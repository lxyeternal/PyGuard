  "purpose": "The script lists Jira issues based on user-specified criteria, retrieves issue data, and formats output for display or scripting.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments and Jira API responses (issue data, fields, search results).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing outputs to console, formatting URLs within output, and calling Jira API methods.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> Jira API search and field retrieval -> Data processing and formatting -> Output display or raw output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of escape sequences to embed URLs in terminal output; no hardcoded secrets or credentials are present; no dynamic code execution; no obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by parsing command-line arguments to customize Jira issue listing. It connects to Jira via a login function, then retrieves issues based on the JQL string. It handles exceptions from Jira errors. Issue fields are processed for display, with options for formatting and raw output. The output formatting includes embedding clickable URLs in terminal output. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are detected. The script operates as a typical command-line tool for Jira issue listing without performing any external or secret actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Jira issue listing utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It safely interacts with Jira APIs and outputs formatted data for user consumption. No malware or security risks are evident.",
