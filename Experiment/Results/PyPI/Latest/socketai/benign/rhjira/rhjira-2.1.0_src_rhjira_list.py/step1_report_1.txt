{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface to query and display issues from a Jira instance, allowing customization of output fields and formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, environment variables (potentially via the login function), and Jira API responses.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout, including formatted tables and URLs embedded in terminal escape sequences.",
  "flows": "User inputs command-line arguments → fetch Jira issues via API → process and format output for display.",
  "anomalies": "Uses escape sequences to embed clickable links in terminal output; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors are visible. No suspicious network activity or backdoors detected. The code relies on external modules (jira, rhjira, tabulate) which are standard for such tools; no malicious code detected within this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles user inputs, communicates with Jira via API calls, and formats output for terminal display. It catches and reports errors from Jira API calls, then exits. The use of escape sequences to embed URLs is intended for improved user experience but does not pose a security risk. There are no hardcoded credentials, no file operations, nor suspicious network activity or obfuscation. No malicious or backdoor code is detected. External dependencies are standard and are used appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard Jira issue listing tool with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs input handling, API interactions, and formatted output display securely. No malware or malicious activity is present, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
