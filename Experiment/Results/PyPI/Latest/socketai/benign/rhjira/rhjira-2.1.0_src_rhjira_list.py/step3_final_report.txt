  "purpose": "A command-line tool to list Jira issues with customizable output formatting and filtering options.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, particularly 'jqlstring'; Jira API responses for issues and fields.",
  "sinks": "Output to terminal; potential exposure of issue data; no external data exfiltration or command execution.",
  "flows": "User supplies 'jqlstring' -> Jira API call with 'search_issues' -> Data processed and formatted for terminal output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of terminal escape sequences for clickable URLs; removal of 'list' from sys.argv; no input sanitization for 'jqlstring'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Jira issue listing with argument parsing, API calls, and output formatting. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. External dependencies are common. The use of escape sequences is a UX feature, not a security flaw. User input 'jqlstring' is directly used in API calls, which could be manipulated but is typical for such scripts. Error messages reveal internal details but are not malicious. Overall, the script is benign with minimal security concerns, primarily related to input handling and error disclosures.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe Jira issue listing utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
