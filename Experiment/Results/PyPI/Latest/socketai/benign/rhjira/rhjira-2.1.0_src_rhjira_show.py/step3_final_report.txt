  "purpose": "A command-line tool to fetch and display Jira ticket details, including comments and custom fields.",
  "sources": "User input for ticket ID, Jira API calls to retrieve issue data",
  "sinks": "Console output displaying formatted issue details and comments",
  "flows": "Input ticket ID -> Jira API fetch -> Data formatting -> Console display",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Jira issue viewer that interacts with Jira APIs to retrieve and display issue data. It handles user input securely via argparse, manages exceptions properly, and formats output cleanly. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain risks are present. The code does not perform any unsafe operations or data exfiltration, and the external libraries used are standard and safe. The comments are printed directly without processing that could lead to injection issues. Overall, the script functions as intended for its purpose without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Jira issue viewer with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1—are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications or higher risk scores are warranted.",
