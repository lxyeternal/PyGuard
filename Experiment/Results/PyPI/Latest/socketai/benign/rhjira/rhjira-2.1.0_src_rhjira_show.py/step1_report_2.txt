{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to retrieve and display detailed information and comments from a Jira ticket, primarily for issue tracking and management purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command line arguments (ticketID), retrieves data from Jira via the jira library, and accesses issue fields and comments.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console; no data is written to external files or networks, except for standard output.",
  "flows": "Input from command line (ticketID) flows into Jira API calls; retrieved issue data flows into text formatting functions and output to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are present. No use of insecure functions or dynamic code execution was observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Jira API interactions: logging in, fetching issues, and formatting outputs. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior. The only noteworthy aspect is reliance on external Jira API, but this is consistent with the intended purpose. No obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or malicious payloads were identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Jira issue viewer script, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It safely retrieves and displays Jira issue details and comments without executing or transmitting sensitive data maliciously.",
