  "purpose": "The script is designed to dump and display fields from a Jira issue, optionally in JSON format, with customizable output options.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line arguments (ticketID, fields, flags) and from Jira API responses (issue data, field definitions).",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output (console) via print statements; data flows include formatted Jira issue fields and comments.",
  "flows": "Input arguments determine which issue fields are retrieved; Jira API responses are processed and formatted for output; user data is retrieved and displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive info. Usage of external Jira modules appears standard. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code extensively handles Jira data retrieval, formatting, and output. It uses standard libraries and Jira SDK methods, with clear data flow from input to output. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are observed. All functions appear to be dedicated to data formatting and printing. No network connections, file operations, or system commands that could be malicious are present. The code lacks hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The command-line interface controls user inputs; all data handling appears benign. There is no indication of malware or malicious intent, nor any code that would perform unauthorized actions beyond standard Jira data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Jira issue data dump tool with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It performs data formatting and display functions using standard libraries and APIs, without suspicious behaviors or malicious payloads.",
