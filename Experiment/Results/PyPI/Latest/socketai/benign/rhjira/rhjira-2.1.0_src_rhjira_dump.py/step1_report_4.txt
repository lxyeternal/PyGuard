  "purpose": "The code is designed to connect to a Jira instance, retrieve issue data, and output various fields and comments for analysis or reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line arguments (ticketID, fields, flags), and interacts with the Jira API to fetch issue details and field data.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console via print statements, including potentially sensitive information like issue fields, user details, comments, and custom fields.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are parsed and used to fetch Jira issue data; retrieved data flows through various dump and evaluate functions which format and print the data to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; no evidence of code injection or dynamic code execution; usage of external Jira library is standard; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity observed in the code itself.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles data retrieval and formatting. It interacts with Jira through the 'jira' library, fetching issue data and fields. The functions systematically format data for output, with options for detailed views and JSON output. No hardcoded secrets, malicious commands, or suspicious code patterns are present. All data output is directed to standard output, and there are no indicators of malicious behavior such as exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code structure is straightforward and intended for reporting or debugging purposes, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Jira data dump utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It simply retrieves and formats data from Jira issues for user inspection, with no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or security risks.",
