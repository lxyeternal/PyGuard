  "purpose": "Automate adding comments to Jira tickets via command-line, files, or editor input.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, specified comment file, external modules (`login`, `util`) for login and editing.",
  "sinks": "jira.add_comment() API call, which sends comment text over HTTPS to Jira server.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line/file → optional editor → jira.add_comment() API call.",
  "anomalies": "Reference to undefined variable `args.template`, use of `os.Exit(1)` instead of `sys.exit(1)`.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Jira comment automation script. It reads input from arguments or files, optionally opens an editor, and posts comments via Jira API. No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The external modules used are standard for Jira integrations. Minor bugs are identified but are not security issues. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minor bugs but no security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or behavior. Minor bugs exist but do not impact security. The overall security assessment is low risk, and the current scores are appropriate.",
