  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with potential minimal security risk if environment variables are manipulated. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The main concern is the reliance on environment variables for subprocess execution, which is typical for such scripts but warrants standard validation in sensitive contexts."
