  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for hashing strings and modifying asset bundle data by replacing path hashcodes.",
  "sources": "Reads input strings for hashing; reads binary data from files in load(); uses data in changePath() for replacement.",
  "sinks": "Replaces byte sequences within self.data based on computed hashcodes; writes data to disk in save().",
  "flows": "Hash code generated from path strings -> hash code embedded in binary data -> replacement of original hashcode bytes with new hashcode bytes.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'original_path_hashcode' in a check before assigning it, causing a logical bug; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward hashing and binary data manipulation. No network activity or malicious code is present. The bug in 'changePath' is a logical error, not malicious. The custom hash function is simple and not obfuscated. No evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The code could be misused but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for asset path modification with a logical bug that could cause runtime errors. No malware or obfuscation detected. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, and malware score is 0. The bug should be fixed for correctness but does not impact security assessment.",
