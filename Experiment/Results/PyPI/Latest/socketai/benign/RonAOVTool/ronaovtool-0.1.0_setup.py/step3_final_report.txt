{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging the 'RonAOVTool' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, static package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows processed during execution.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment; no dynamic or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and follows typical packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script using setuptools. It reads a local README file with specified encoding, defines package metadata, and discovers packages via find_packages(). No user input, network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's static, configuration-only purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
