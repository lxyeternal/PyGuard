  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the RonAOVTool Python library, defining metadata and package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading package details, package discovery via find_packages(), reading README.md file.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present; no network, file write, or system calls involved.",
  "flows": "Input data (package info, README content) used to configure package metadata, with no untrusted data flow leading to dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for packaging, specifies package metadata including name, version, description, author info, license, and classifiers. It dynamically reads the long description from README.md with UTF-8 encoding, which is a common and safe practice. No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The script follows standard Python packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, performing standard package configuration without any malicious intent or security risks.",
