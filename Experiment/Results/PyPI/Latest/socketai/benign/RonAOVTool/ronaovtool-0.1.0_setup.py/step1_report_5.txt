  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the RonAOVTool Python library, including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description",
  "sinks": "No significant sinks identified; no untrusted data output or external effect.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content during setup, no data flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup.py structure. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools to define package setup parameters. It specifies package metadata such as name, version, author, license, and classifiers. It uses find_packages() to include all sub-packages. It reads the 'README.md' file for a detailed description, which is a common practice. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, no credential handling, or obfuscated code present. Overall, it appears to be a typical package setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
