  "sources": "Reading package details, reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Package metadata and description data flow from static variables and file read into setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging. It reads package metadata and description information, including reading 'README.md' with explicit encoding. No input sanitization issues, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations or data leaks observed. The structure follows typical setup.py conventions without suspicious modifications or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate configuration for packaging a Python library with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
