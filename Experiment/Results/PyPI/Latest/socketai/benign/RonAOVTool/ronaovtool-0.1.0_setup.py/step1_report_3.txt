{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'RonAOVTool'. It specifies metadata and packaging instructions for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the package name, version, description, long description from 'README.md', author details, license, classifiers, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not process untrusted input or write sensitive data. It primarily reads static configuration data.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code is configuration-based and does not involve data flow or execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be standard package setup configuration, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' modules and calls the 'setup' function with static parameters. It reads the 'README.md' file for the long description, which is a common practice. No user input, environment variables, or external data are used in a manner that could pose security risks. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It only defines package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
