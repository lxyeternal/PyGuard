{
  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'RonAOVTool'. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and descriptions for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata directly from hardcoded strings and from the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data; the script is standard for package setup and does not handle user input or external data at runtime.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration data is used without dynamic or external data input during execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard setuptools functions, reads a local file for the long description, and contains no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional setup.py file for Python package distribution. It imports 'setuptools', configures package metadata including name, version, author, description, license, and classifiers. It reads the long description from 'README.md' with specified encoding. No user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. All elements follow typical setup practices without any signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It purely defines package metadata and reads a local file for documentation.",
