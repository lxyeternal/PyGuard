  "obfuscated": 0.8,

  "conclusion": "Benign code is correctly scored with low malware and obfuscation. Suspicious code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting higher malware scores. Slightly increasing report 5's malware score to 0.6 improves alignment with observed patterns. Overall, the scoring is appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
