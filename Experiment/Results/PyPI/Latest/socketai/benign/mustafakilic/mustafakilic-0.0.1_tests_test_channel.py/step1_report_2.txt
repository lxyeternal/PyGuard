{
  "purpose": "This code appears to initialize some variables and import standard modules; no explicit purpose can be inferred without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the environment, imported modules, and potentially input functions if present, but none are explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are unclear due to lack of specific functions; however, if any input is processed or output functions are used, they could be points where untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are evident from the provided code snippet; the code's flow is limited to imports and variable initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present in the visible code; the code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard import statements and variable definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. There are no indications of data exfiltration, malicious API calls, or unusual logic. Since the code snippet is minimal, it's difficult to identify any malicious intent or security issues beyond normal operations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malware or malicious activity. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies. Confidence is high that this code is safe in its current form.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
