  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input data, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded strings, environment reads.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, system commands, data exfiltration points, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or eval/exec lead to potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious variable naming, indirect data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are red flags for malicious intent. Benign code shows no such patterns. Suspicious patterns include eval usage, obfuscation, and environment reads. Scores are generally aligned: benign code has malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2; suspicious code (reports 4 and 5) shows higher scores, with report 4's malware at 0.6 justified by obfuscation and eval, and report 5's malware at 0.4 being conservative. Slightly increasing report 5's malware score to 0.5-0.6 would better reflect the suspicious patterns. Obfuscation scores in suspicious reports are high, matching the description. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, with minor adjustments recommended for report 5.",
  "conclusion": "Benign code is correctly scored with low malware and obfuscation. Suspicious code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting higher malware scores. Slightly increasing report 5's malware score to 0.6 improves alignment with observed patterns. Overall, the scoring is appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
