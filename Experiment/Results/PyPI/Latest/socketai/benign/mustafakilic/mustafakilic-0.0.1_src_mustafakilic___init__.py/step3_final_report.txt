  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code snippets and analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network connections, file I/O, external library calls, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file write/read operations, subprocess calls, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or environment variables flow into functions that process or transmit data, potentially reaching sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets provided are minimal or absent, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk scores (~0.2), reflecting the benign nature and limited information. Confidence levels are moderate to low due to lack of detailed code, but the assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the dependency code is benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The current scoring of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 is appropriate. No adjustments are necessary; the risk remains minimal.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
