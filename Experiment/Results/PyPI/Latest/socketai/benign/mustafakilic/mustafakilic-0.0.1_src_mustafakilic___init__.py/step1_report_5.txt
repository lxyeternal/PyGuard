  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but the specific intent cannot be determined due to the lack of comments or documentation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and possibly user input or function parameters (not explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Data may be sent over the network via HTTP requests or written to files; specific sinks are not detailed but can be inferred from common usage patterns.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs through functions to network calls or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard libraries appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to utilize common Python modules and functions. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. Without specific code snippets, detailed analysis is limited, but no malicious behavior or suspicious activity is evident from typical patterns. The absence of comments or documentation limits clarity, but nothing stands out as malicious. No indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful actions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script with standard operations. Due to limited details, confidence remains moderate.",
