  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data flows exist.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is trivial with only a comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is an empty module with a comment string. All reports agree that there is no executable code, data input/output, or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the absence of any operational or malicious content. Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty about the benign and trivial nature of the code. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder with no security risks or malicious activity. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or concern is warranted.",
