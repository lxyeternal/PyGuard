  "analysis": "The provided code contains only a comment string and no executable code. As a result, there are no sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies to analyze. This suggests the module is either a placeholder or incomplete. Without actual code, there is no opportunity for malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is effectively empty aside from a comment, posing no security risk or malicious intent. It appears to be a placeholder or incomplete module with no detectable issues.",
