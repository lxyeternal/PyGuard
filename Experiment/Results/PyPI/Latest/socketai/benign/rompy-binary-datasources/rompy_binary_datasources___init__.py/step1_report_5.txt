{
  "purpose": "Define and export the top-level package interface for 'rompy-binary-datasources', specifying author information and importing key classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Author, email, and version metadata; import statements for SourceDataset and SourceTimeseriesDataFrame from the local source module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data input/output operations are observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily sets metadata and imports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets beyond metadata, or obfuscated elements are present. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes package metadata, which is common practice. It imports classes from a local module, likely defining core functionality. There are no input handling, data processing, network calls, or security-sensitive operations observed. The code's structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization script that defines metadata and exports classes. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues.",
