{
  "purpose": "This code defines the top-level package for 'rompy-binary-datasources', establishing package metadata and importing core classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__) and imports modules (.source).",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from sources to sinks is present; the code primarily sets up package metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The metadata variables are standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package-level metadata and imports specific classes from a local module. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or dynamic execution. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security concerns. It only contains metadata and import statements typical for Python packages.",
