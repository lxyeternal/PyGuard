{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the top-level package initialization for the 'rompy-binary-datasources' Python package, primarily setting metadata and exporting specific classes.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__), and the import statement importing classes from a local module (.source).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external output; no network, file, or environment interactions.",
  "flows": "The only flow is importing classes 'SourceDataset' and 'SourceTimeseriesDataFrame' from a local module, with no data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior; the code is straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines package metadata and imports two classes from a relative module, then specifies exportable symbols. It does not process data, invoke network or file I/O, or perform any operations that could be malicious. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It primarily sets metadata and exports classes for the package.",
