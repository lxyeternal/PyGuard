{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the package initializer (__init__.py) for 'rompy-binary-datasources', setting metadata and importing core classes for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__) and imports classes from a local module (.source).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static metadata definitions to class imports, with no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initialization script with static metadata and class imports. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted inputs. The code is standard and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning high confidence scores (1) and zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and clarity support these conclusions, and there are no anomalies or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
