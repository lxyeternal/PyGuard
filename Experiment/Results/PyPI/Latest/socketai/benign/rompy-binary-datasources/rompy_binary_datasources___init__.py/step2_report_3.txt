  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports agree that the code is a straightforward package initializer (`__init__.py`) that sets metadata and imports classes from a local module. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data processing, network operations, or handling of untrusted inputs.  \n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no issues present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is standard package setup code, with no malicious or suspicious elements. No logical errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- `confidence`: 1 (high confidence in their assessment)\n- `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n- `malware`: 0 (no malware)\n- `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the code's nature. Since the code is purely metadata and import statements, these scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, there's no justification for higher risk scores. The code does not perform any operations that could pose security concerns.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis. The code does not include any malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports are cautious and avoid assumptions beyond what the code shows. They correctly identify that the code is standard package setup code with no suspicious elements.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis: all are 0 for malware and security risk, with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\nThe code is a typical, benign package initializer with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\nGiven the uniformity and clarity of the code, I concur with the provided assessments. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code snippet.",
