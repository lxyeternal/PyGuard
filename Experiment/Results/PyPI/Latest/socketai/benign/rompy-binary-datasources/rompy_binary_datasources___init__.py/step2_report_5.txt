  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential risks, and consistency of the scores.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard package initializer (__init__.py), with metadata variables and import statements.\n- No report indicates any data processing, network activity, user input handling, or dynamic code execution.\n- All mention the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the lack of malicious activity.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all cases, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code is a simple package setup with no evident issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent.\n- No evidence of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n- The metadata variables are standard and do not pose security risks.\n- Importing local classes without external dependencies or dynamic execution.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No flaws or logical errors are apparent in the reasoning.\n- The assessments about the absence of security risks and malicious behavior are justified.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code. No change needed.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports give 0, which is reasonable since there's no security concern.\n\n### Risk Score Higher Than 0.5?\n- No, all scores are 0, indicating no risk, which is justified.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard package initialization file with no security issues. The reports are accurate and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n**I agree with the assessments provided.** The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code's simplicity.",
