{
  "purpose": "Initialize the top-level package for rompy-binary-datasources, setting metadata and importing key classes.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__), and the local module .source",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data processing, network, or untrusted input handling present",
  "flows": "Metadata variables and imported classes are assigned or referenced; no data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code execution, data processing, or external interactions; only metadata and imports",
  "analysis": "The code defines package-level metadata and imports specific classes from a local module. There are no functions, data processing, or external data handling. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or credential handling are present. The module's structure appears typical for Python packages, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It merely sets metadata and imports classes, representing normal package setup.",
