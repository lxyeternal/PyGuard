{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the top-level package initializer for 'rompy-binary-datasources', importing specific classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__), and the import statement from the local module source.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the import statement simply includes local classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains standard package initialization with no suspicious logic or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and imports specific classes from a local module, then exposes those classes. It does not include any user input handling, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It merely sets up metadata and imports classes for the package's public API.",
