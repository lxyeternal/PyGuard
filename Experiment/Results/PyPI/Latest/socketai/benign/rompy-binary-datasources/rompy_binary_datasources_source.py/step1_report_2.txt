{
  "purpose": "Defines source classes for handling binary data formats (xarray Dataset and pandas DataFrame) within the rompy package.",
  "sources": "Imports pandas, xarray, and pydantic; reads class definitions and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network operations; only data validation and transformation within the classes.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame or Dataset objects are validated and then returned or transformed into other data structures internally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data classes with validation for pandas DataFrame and xarray Dataset objects. It uses type annotations, pydantic validators, and standard data transformations. No network access, external system calls, or suspicious logic is present. The code is straightforward, mainly focused on data validation and conversion. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured data handling classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It mainly validates and converts data objects internally for further processing. No security risks or malware signs are detected.",
