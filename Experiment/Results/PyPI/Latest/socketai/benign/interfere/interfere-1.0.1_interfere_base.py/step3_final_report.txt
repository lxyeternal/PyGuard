{
  "purpose": "The code defines abstract base classes for dynamic models, interventions, and forecasting methods, serving as interfaces for subclasses to implement specific behaviors. It handles data input via function arguments and class attributes, with no external data transmission or system modifications.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through method parameters such as t, prior_states, prior_t, intervention functions, and class attributes. No external data sources or network calls are present.",
  "sinks": "Data flows internally within class methods; there are no external network transmissions, file I/O, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Source data (inputs and parameters) flow into class methods (_simulate, _predict, fit, etc.), with potential intervention functions modifying states, but all within the code's internal logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of numpy's RNG is standard and benign. Intervention functions are externally supplied but are typical in such frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured set of abstract base classes for modeling, intervention, and forecasting, with comprehensive input validation and standard library usage. No external communication, malicious payloads, or obfuscation are present. The only potential risk stems from user-defined subclasses or intervention functions, which could be malicious if misused, but this is inherent to the design pattern and not a flaw in the base code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe framework for dynamic modeling and forecasting with minimal security concerns. The absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or external system interaction indicates a malware score of 0. The low risk score (~0.1) accounts for the potential misuse of externally supplied functions but does not reflect inherent malicious intent.",
