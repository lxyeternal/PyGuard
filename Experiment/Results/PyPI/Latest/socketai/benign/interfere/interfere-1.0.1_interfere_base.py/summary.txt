  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe framework for dynamic modeling and forecasting with minimal security concerns. The absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or external system interaction indicates a malware score of 0. The low risk score (~0.1) accounts for the potential misuse of externally supplied functions but does not reflect inherent malicious intent."
