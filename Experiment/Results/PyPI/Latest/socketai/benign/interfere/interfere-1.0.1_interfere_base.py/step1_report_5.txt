{
  "purpose": "This code defines abstract base classes and utility functions for a dynamic systems modeling and forecasting package, including models, interventions, and forecasting methods.",
  "sources": "Input sources include parameters provided to class constructors (__init__), method arguments for simulation and prediction functions (e.g., t, prior_states, prior_t, intervention), and data read within methods such as simulate, fit, predict, split_exog, and eval_at_times.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points include the simulate, add_measurement_noise, and predict methods where untrusted or manipulated data could influence the system's behavior; particularly, the use of intervention functions which can alter the state of the system. Also, the _simulate and _predict methods, which are abstract and meant to be implemented, could introduce malicious behaviors if overridden maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments (e.g., prior_states, prior_t, t) through the simulation and prediction pipelines, potentially modified by intervention functions, into abstract _simulate and _predict implementations, which generate trajectory outputs. Intervention functions can modify states during simulation, which could be exploited if malicious code is implemented in __call__ or combine_exog.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code patterns such as obfuscation, hidden code, or code that directly executes external code. It has standard abstract class structures, type hints, and input validation. No hard-coded secrets or backdoors are present. The only potential concern is the use of abstract methods (__call__, _simulate, _predict) which depend on user-defined subclasses, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of abstract base classes for dynamic models, interventions, and forecasting methods, with robust input validation and placeholder methods intended for subclass implementation. It employs a modular design with clear source and sink points. The intervention classes include methods for splitting and combining signals, with no direct external communication or data exfiltration present. The random number generator is used locally for noise addition. The code does not contain any network calls, file operations, or code injection points. The core functions are abstract and require user implementation; therefore, potential malicious behavior depends on user-defined subclasses, not the provided base classes themselves.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks in the provided code. It is a standard, well-structured abstract class definition intended for extensibility. The primary security consideration is that subclasses could be malicious if they override methods (__call__, _simulate, _predict) with harmful code, but the base code itself is benign.",
