{
  "purpose": "The code implements classes for neural and oscillator models (Hodgkin-Huxley, LEGION, Stuart-Landau Kuramoto) intended for scientific simulation, with configurable parameters, stochastic elements, intervention hooks, and support for various connection types.",
  "sources": "Internal data flows from parameters, simulation functions, intervention functions, and random number generators; no external data sources or network communication detected.",
  "sinks": "Internal state updates and computations; no external communication, file I/O, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through simulation steps, intervention functions, and internal model updates, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. Dependency on a forked pyclustering library is documented in the import error message.",
  "analysis": "The code defines scientific models with detailed parameters and internal state management. It uses standard practices for stochastic simulation, intervention hooks, and noise addition. No network activity, external data leaks, or malicious code patterns are present. The reliance on a custom forked library is documented and justified, not suspicious. The code is well-structured, commented, and performs numerical computations typical of research software.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific simulation suite with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The dependency on a forked external library is documented and not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, primarily due to external dependency considerations but not indicative of malicious intent.",
