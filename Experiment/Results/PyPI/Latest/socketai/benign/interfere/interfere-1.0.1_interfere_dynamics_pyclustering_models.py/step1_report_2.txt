{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for simulating neural network models and dynamical systems, specifically Hodgkin-Huxley, LEGION, and Stuart-Landau Kuramoto models, with support for stochasticity, interventions, and different connection types.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from external modules (pyclustering, numpy), user-provided stimuli, initial states, random number generators, and optional interventions.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into simulation functions, and untrusted input could potentially influence random seed, intervention functions, or parameters passed to models.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from intervention functions or random number generators can influence the model states during simulation steps. No network or external data transmission observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of try-except for import, complex class definitions, and extensive parameter handling are standard. No obfuscated code, no hidden network communication, or system modifications. Noise functions and interventions are configurable and controlled locally. No evidence of malicious payloads or data exfiltration. No use of dangerous functions like eval or exec. All imported modules are typical for scientific computations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides scientific simulation classes with detailed configuration options for neural and oscillator models. It handles imports carefully, with error messages guiding installation of dependencies. The models utilize random number generation for stochasticity and support intervention functions for external control. There are no indications of malicious activities such as network communications, data theft, or system sabotage. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code flows, or obfuscated code patterns are present. Usage of numpy and pyclustering is consistent with scientific computing practices, and all data flows are contained within the simulation scope. The code appears to be legitimate and intended for research or analysis purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of scientific simulation classes implementing neural and oscillator models with configurable parameters. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms. The code is well-structured for its intended purpose, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
