  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a stochastic SIS epidemic model. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The assigned malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.0–0.1), reflecting its benign, scientific purpose."
