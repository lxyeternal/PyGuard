  "purpose": "Implementation of a stochastic SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model for network epidemic dynamics, involving parameters for curing rates, adjacency matrix, and stochastic noise.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as delta, adjacency_matrix, measurement_noise_std, sigma; internal class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data flows within numpy operations and class methods, with no external data or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and assigned; drift method computes infection dynamics; noise method provides stochastic noise parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; straightforward mathematical modeling code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation for shape consistency, implements standard SIS model equations via numpy matrix operations, and provides well-documented methods. No external system calls, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The code is typical scientific modeling code, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a stochastic SIS epidemic model. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The assigned malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.0–0.1), reflecting its benign, scientific purpose.",
