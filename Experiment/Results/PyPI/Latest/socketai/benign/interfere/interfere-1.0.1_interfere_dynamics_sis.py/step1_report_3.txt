{
  "purpose": "Defines a stochastic SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model for simulating network infection dynamics.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments: delta, adjacency_matrix, measurement_noise_std, sigma. Uses class attributes self.delta, self.adjacency_matrix, self.sigma.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data, no external data output, no network connections or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used internally for calculations in the drift and noise functions. No external or untrusted data flows to other systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Standard usage of numpy and class inheritance. No dynamic code execution or external communications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a stochastic SIS model using numpy for matrix operations. It includes input validation for array shapes and follows typical modeling patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. It leverages class inheritance and decorators for documentation copying, which are standard practices. The functions implement model dynamics without external side effects or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific modeling component without malicious intent. It performs standard computations related to network infection modeling with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
