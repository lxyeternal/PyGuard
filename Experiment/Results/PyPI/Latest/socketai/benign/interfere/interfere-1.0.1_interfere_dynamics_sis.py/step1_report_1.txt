{
  "purpose": "Define a stochastic SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model for simulating network infection dynamics.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments: delta, adjacency_matrix, measurement_noise_std, sigma. It also accesses class attributes self.delta, self.adjacency_matrix, and self.sigma.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data directly into vulnerable operations like executing system commands, writing to files, or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (delta, adjacency_matrix, measurement_noise_std, sigma) flows into class attributes and methods (drift, noise). The drift method computes a mathematical model based on these inputs; the noise method returns the stochastic noise parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, obfuscated language, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The code performs standard mathematical operations and input validation without any hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an SIS model in Python, with proper input validation and documentation. It imports numpy, defines a class with methods for the model's drift and noise, and checks for shape consistency in inputs. No hardcoded secrets, external system calls, or malicious patterns are detected. The code adheres to typical practices for such models and does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a stochastic SIS model without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily performs mathematical modeling with validated inputs and no suspicious operations.",
