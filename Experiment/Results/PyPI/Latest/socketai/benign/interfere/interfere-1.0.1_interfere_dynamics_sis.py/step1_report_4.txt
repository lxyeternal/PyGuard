{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a stochastic SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) network model for simulating infection dynamics.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy for numerical operations, imports copy_doc decorator, and inherits from a base class. No external input reading beyond method parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data outputs. No network connections, file operations, or system calls present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through method parameters such as delta, adjacency_matrix, measurement_noise_std, sigma. These are used internally for calculations, with no external or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. Standard mathematical operations and shape checks are used properly. No embedded or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an SIS model class inheriting from a base stochastic differential equation class. It includes initialization with parameter validation, especially shape consistency. The drift and noise methods perform standard vector operations without external data access or system interaction. No signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activities are detected. The implementation appears to be a straightforward mathematical model without external dependencies that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a typical SIS model with proper parameter validation and mathematical operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate scientific computing module without suspicious elements.",
