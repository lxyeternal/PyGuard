{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Susceptible–Infected–Susceptible (SIS) model for network dynamics simulation, including stochastic elements.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters (delta, adjacency_matrix, measurement_noise_std, sigma), and data passed to drift and noise methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, network, or files. No sinks for untrusted data found.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in constructor; drift method computes infection dynamics; noise method provides stochastic noise, which is a static attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected. Use of standard mathematical operations and numpy functions without dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a stochastic SIS model, with input validation, parameter storage, and basic mathematical operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The methods perform clear, standard calculations for a differential equation model. The import statements are typical, and there are no dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a legitimate scientific or modeling implementation of a network SIS epidemic process. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It is well-structured with proper validation and documentation.",
