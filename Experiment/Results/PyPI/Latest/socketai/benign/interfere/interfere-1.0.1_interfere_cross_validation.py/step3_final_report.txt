{
  "purpose": "Implements a cross-validation routine for time series forecasting and intervention prediction, compatible with hyperparameter tuning frameworks like optuna.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays, time indices, and hyperparameter functions; accesses model fit and predict methods; reads configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data flows internally through model training, prediction, and scoring; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data is sourced from numpy arrays, passed into model fit/predict methods, with results stored in internal structures; exception handling manages errors without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a large 'repl_nan_val' (1e10) to replace NaNs is unconventional but not malicious; no suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cross-validation for time series models, with data splitting, model fitting, prediction, and error scoring. Exception handling is used appropriately. No external network calls, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code are present. The large NaN replacement value is unusual but not malicious. The code's structure and logic align with legitimate model validation routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of time series cross-validation with hyperparameter tuning support. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation are evident.",
