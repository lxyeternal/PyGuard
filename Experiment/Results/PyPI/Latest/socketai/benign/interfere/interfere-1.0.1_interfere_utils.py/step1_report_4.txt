{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions, specifically a decorator to copy the docstring from one function to another.",
  "sources": "The code reads function objects to access their __doc__ attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code only modifies function attributes locally.",
  "flows": "The decorator retrieves the __doc__ from copy_func and assigns it to the decorated function.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard with no unusual constructs; it does not perform any file I/O, network activity, or data processing beyond attribute assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases and a decorator that copies the docstring from one function to another. It uses standard typing constructs and no dynamic code execution or external data handling. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior. The decorator simply assigns the __doc__ attribute, which is safe and typical in Python code. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or potentially malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for copying docstrings between functions, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe and serves a documentation-related purpose.",
