  "purpose": "Utility decorator to copy the docstring from one function to another for documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The source function 'copy_func' from which the docstring is copied.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to 'func.__doc__' where the docstring is set on the target function.",
  "flows": "The decorator wraps 'func', copying the '__doc__' attribute from 'copy_func' to 'func' during decoration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a simple attribute assignment with no side effects or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'copy_doc' that assigns the '__doc__' attribute from 'copy_func' to 'func'. It uses standard Python features, type annotations, and no dynamic code execution. The operation is safe, straightforward, and common for documentation management. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute code dynamically. The assignment is a benign attribute modification. All signals indicate a benign utility function with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, well-structured utility for copying docstrings. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious behavior, and is free of obfuscation. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk should be 0, with high confidence (1).",
