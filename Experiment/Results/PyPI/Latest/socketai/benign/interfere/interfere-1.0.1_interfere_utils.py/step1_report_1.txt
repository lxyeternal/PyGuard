{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions and type aliases for use as decorators, specifically for copying docstrings from one function to another.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'copy_func' parameter (a function to copy the docstring from) and the 'func' parameter (the function being decorated).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the assignment to 'func.__doc__', which could modify the function's documentation, but poses no security risk by itself.",
  "flows": "Input from 'copy_func' (the source) flows into 'func.__doc__' (the sink) during the execution of the 'wrapped' decorator.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs a straightforward docstring copy operation with proper type annotations and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing modules and defines a type alias for a decorator. The 'copy_doc' function takes a function as input and returns a decorator that assigns its docstring to another function. The decorator 'wrapped' modifies the '__doc__' attribute directly, which is a standard practice for docstring copying. No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution is involved. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for copying docstrings between functions. It contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
