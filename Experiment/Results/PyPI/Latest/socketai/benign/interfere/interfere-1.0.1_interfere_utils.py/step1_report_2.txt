{
  "purpose": "Provide a decorator to copy the docstring from one function to another.",
  "sources": "The function copy_doc takes a function copy_func as input and reads its __doc__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "The wrapped function assigns the __doc__ attribute of copy_func to another function's __doc__.",
  "flows": "copy_func.__doc__ -> wrapped -> func.__doc__ assignment",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and intentionally designed to copy documentation strings. No hidden or obfuscated code is present. No input/output operations, no network or file access, and no manipulation of untrusted data are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a type alias for a decorator and a function that creates a decorator to copy docstrings. It uses standard typing and typing_extensions modules, with no unusual language features or dynamic execution. The decorator simply assigns the __doc__ attribute of one function to another, which is a benign operation. No external data, no cryptic code, and no apparent malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility function for copying docstrings between functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
