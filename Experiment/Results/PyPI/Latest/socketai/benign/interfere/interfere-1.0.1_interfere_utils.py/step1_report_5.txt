  "purpose": "Provides a decorator function to copy the docstring from one function to another.",
  "sources": "The code reads the docstring (__doc__) of the 'copy_func' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The decorator modifies the __doc__ attribute of the target function, which is a safe operation.",
  "flows": "Input source is 'copy_func' docstring; flow to target function via attribute assignment (__doc__).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of typing and decorators is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases and a decorator 'copy_doc' that copies a function's docstring to another function. It imports standard modules and typing extensions. The decorator assigns the __doc__ attribute directly, which is a common practice for docstring copying. No input/output operations, network access, or security-sensitive behavior are present. No obfuscation, malware, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for documentation purposes without malicious intent or security risks.",
