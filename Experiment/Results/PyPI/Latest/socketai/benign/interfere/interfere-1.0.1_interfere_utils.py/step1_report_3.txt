  "purpose": "Provide a decorator to copy the docstring from one function to another.",
  "sources": "The code reads the docstring (__doc__) of the 'copy_func' parameter function.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns the docstring to another function's __doc__ attribute.",
  "flows": "The decorator retrieves the docstring from 'copy_func' and assigns it to the decorated function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a type alias and a decorator factory 'copy_doc'. It captures a function 'copy_func' and creates a decorator 'wrapped' that copies the docstring from 'copy_func' to the target function. It uses standard Python features and type annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious side-effects. The purpose is to enhance documentation management in codebases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for copying docstrings between functions. It contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
