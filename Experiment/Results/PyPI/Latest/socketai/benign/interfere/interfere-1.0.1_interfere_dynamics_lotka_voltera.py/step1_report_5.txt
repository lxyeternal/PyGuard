  "purpose": "This code defines classes for simulating deterministic and stochastic Lotka-Volterra models for ecological dynamics.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters such as growth_rates, capacities, interaction_mat, and measurement_noise_std. These are used for model initialization and computations within methods.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could be input parameters that influence simulation behavior. However, no direct sinks like network communication or file writing are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and assigned, then used in mathematical calculations within dXdt, drift, and noise functions to produce derivatives and stochastic effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions are present. The code adheres to standard scientific computation practices for differential equations. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. Error handling is proper.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for simulating Lotka-Volterra systems, with methods for computing derivatives and stochastic terms. It performs input validation, raises appropriate errors for dimension mismatches, and does not include any network or file I/O operations. No suspicious or malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors, is detected. Use of numpy and standard class inheritance is typical for scientific modeling. The stochastic class adds noise to the model, but this is a legitimate simulation feature. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation of ecological models without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard ecological modeling classes for deterministic and stochastic Lotka-Volterra systems. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It appears to be legitimate scientific simulation code with proper validation and structure.",
