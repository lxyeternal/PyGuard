  "purpose": "The code defines classes for simulating Lotka-Volterra predator-prey dynamics, both deterministic and stochastic versions, for ecological modeling.",
  "sources": "Input data includes model parameters such as growth rates, capacities, interaction matrices, and optional measurement noise and sigma values. Data is received via class constructors and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code computes derivatives and noise based on the input parameters; no external untrusted data is directly processed in a way that leads to data leaks or exploits. No external sinks like network calls, file operations, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class initializations into internal parameters, then through methods like dXdt and drift to compute derivatives and noise based on these parameters. No external untrusted sources influence these computations at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code performs standard mathematical operations and parameter validation. No obfuscated language features or unusual code constructs are present. The only potentially suspicious aspect is the check that prevents stochastic simulation if sigma is set, but this aligns with intended behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for simulating ecological dynamics using well-known equations. It validates input dimensions, assigns parameters, and implements standard differential and stochastic differential equations. The stochastic class correctly calls the parent class's constructor and defines drift and noise functions consistent with stochastic modeling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The validation and calculations are typical for scientific computing. The code does not process external untrusted data at runtime in a harmful way. Overall, the code appears to be a standard scientific modeling implementation with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical implementation of ecological model simulations using differential equations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The code follows standard patterns and includes appropriate input validation. It is safe from a security standpoint.",
