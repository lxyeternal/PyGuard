  "purpose": "Implementation of deterministic and stochastic Lotka-Volterra ecological models for simulating species interactions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as growth_rates, capacities, interaction_mat, and sigma during class initialization; internal derivative calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external data output, network activity, or file I/O; computations are self-contained within class methods.",
  "flows": "Parameters flow from initialization to class attributes; derivative and noise functions use these attributes to compute model dynamics.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected; input validation is standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard ecological models with proper validation, clear structure, and typical stochastic noise modeling. No malicious logic, external data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The stochastic component (sigma * x) is a common approach; the input validation prevents misuse. The code is well-documented and aligns with scientific modeling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of ecological differential equations with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
