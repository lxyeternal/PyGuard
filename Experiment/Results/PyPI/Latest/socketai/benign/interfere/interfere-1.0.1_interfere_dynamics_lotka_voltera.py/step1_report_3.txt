  "purpose": "The code defines classes for simulating deterministic and stochastic Lotka-Volterra models, used for ecological dynamics analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: growth_rates, capacities, interaction_mat, measurement_noise_std, sigma. Data is used in computations within dXdt, drift, and noise methods.",
  "sinks": "Methods compute derivatives and stochastic noise based on input parameters; no direct untrusted data outputs or external calls that leak data are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class initializations, used in derivative calculations and stochastic noise generation within methods; no external untrusted data sources or sinks are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code adheres to standard mathematical modeling practices. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard ecological models with proper validation of input dimensions and parameters. It includes stochastic and deterministic classes with clear inheritance and method definitions. No suspicious external calls, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns are identified. Usage of numpy for calculations and the absence of network, file I/O, or credential handling indicates typical scientific computation code.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard implementation of ecological modeling classes with no malicious behavior detected. The functions are straightforward, well-documented, and aligned with scientific modeling conventions. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
