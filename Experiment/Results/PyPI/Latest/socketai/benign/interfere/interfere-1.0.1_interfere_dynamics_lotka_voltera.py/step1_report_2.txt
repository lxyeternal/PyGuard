{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for simulating deterministic and stochastic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey models, including parameter validation and differential equation definitions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters such as growth_rates, capacities, interaction_mat, measurement_noise_std, and sigma during class initialization; the derivative functions access current state x and time t.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to send or write data externally; it primarily performs calculations and raises exceptions for validation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to compute derivatives and initialize models; no external data flows are apparent or utilized in a malicious manner.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, hidden backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The measurement noise and stochastic components are standard for such models.",
  "analysis": "The code implements mathematical models for ecological dynamics with proper input validation and class inheritance. The functions compute derivatives according to standard Lotka-Volterra equations. The stochastic class incorporates noise proportional to state variables. No obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or malicious data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of ecological models for simulation purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities within the provided code.",
