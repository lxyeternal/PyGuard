  "purpose": "Define various classes and functions for performing different types of interventions on model variables, including identity, perfect, and signal interventions, for use in dynamic modeling or simulation.",
  "sources": "Input arrays (x), time variable (t), and parameters like indices, constants, and functions within intervention methods and functions.",
  "sinks": "Data modifications on input arrays (x) during intervention application; no external sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from arguments (x, t) through intervention functions, modifying copies of input arrays and returning the results; no untrusted external data flow or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The code uses standard Python features, numpy operations, and straightforward control flows.",
  "analysis": "The code implements intervention classes and functions for dynamic model simulations, focusing on replacing or modifying variables at specified indices with constants or signals. All modifications are confined to copying and altering numpy arrays. There are no network operations, system calls, or suspicious data handling. No obfuscated code or hidden functionalities are present. The code appears to serve a clear purpose related to model intervention mechanisms. No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code provides well-defined intervention classes and functions for simulation purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It operates solely on input data and functions without external dependencies or side effects. The overall security risk is minimal.",
