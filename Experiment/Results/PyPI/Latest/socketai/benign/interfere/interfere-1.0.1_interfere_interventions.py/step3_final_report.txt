{
  "purpose": "Defines intervention classes and factory functions for modeling variable manipulations in dynamic systems, including identity, perfect, and signal interventions.",
  "sources": "Input numpy arrays representing system states and time; user-provided functions for signals.",
  "sinks": "Modified numpy arrays within the intervention functions; no external data leaks or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are copied and specific indices are replaced with constants or signals based on intervention type.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; use of user-defined functions is standard in modeling contexts; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs straightforward class definitions and functions for interventions, with proper input validation and array copying to prevent side effects. No external system interactions, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The use of callable signals introduces minimal risk if untrusted functions are supplied, but this is typical in simulation frameworks. The code's clarity and lack of obfuscation support a low malware and obfuscation score. The slight elevation in security risk (0.1) reflects potential misuse of user-provided functions, but no actual malicious activity exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe for use in modeling interventions, and exhibits no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score is justified by the potential for misuse of user-defined functions but does not indicate a real threat.",
