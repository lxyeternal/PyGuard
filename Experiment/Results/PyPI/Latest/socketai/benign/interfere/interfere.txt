      "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of import statements from internal modules, with no malicious intent or security risks. The initial reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign appropriate low malware and security risk scores. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is conservative; it can be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe framework for dynamic modeling and forecasting with minimal security concerns. The absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or external system interaction indicates a malware score of 0. The low risk score (~0.1) accounts for the potential misuse of externally supplied functions but does not reflect inherent malicious intent."

The dependency on a forked external library is documented and not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, primarily due to external dependency considerations but not indicative of malicious intent."
