  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code uses standard libraries (numpy, scipy), performs statistical and error metrics, and contains no network or system modifications.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious activity detected. The code is a straightforward evaluation suite.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the absence of malicious code, suspicious patterns, or external communication. The code is mainly statistical and mathematical computations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — aligns with the detailed analysis.\n- **Justification:** The detailed reasoning supports the low risk assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate and justified.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the reviewer notes standard statistical and error metrics, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — consistent with the content.\n- **Justification:** The code's purpose and operations are legitimate, with no external or hidden behaviors.\n\n**Verdict:** **Sound and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The same conclusion—no malicious activity, no external data leaks, and standard scientific computations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — justified.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code's structure and purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior reports, emphasizing the absence of malicious behavior, external communication, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — fitting.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely analytical, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** **Correct and well-justified.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code is a set of evaluation metrics for time series and counterfactual forecasting, relying solely on numpy and scipy.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent in any report.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the content.\n- **Scores consistency:** The scores are consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
