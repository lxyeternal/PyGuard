{
  "purpose": "The code provides various metrics and utility functions for evaluating counterfactual forecasting models and time series prediction accuracy.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data arrays (X, X_do, X_do_pred), intervention indices, and optional parameters from function arguments and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that send untrusted data over a network or perform malicious actions. No code writes sensitive data to external systems, nor does it execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through metric calculations, statistical tests, and error computations, with no external system interaction or data exfiltration pathways identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears to implement standard statistical metrics and data manipulation functions without obfuscated constructs or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes and functions for evaluating forecasting accuracy, including statistical tests and error metrics. It uses standard numpy and scipy libraries for numerical computations. No code attempts to connect to external servers, execute system commands, or access environment variables or sensitive data. There are no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The only external dependencies are well-known scientific computing libraries. Overall, the code appears to serve its intended analytical purpose with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of statistical metrics and utilities for time series and counterfactual evaluation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks. It safely implements standard analysis methods without obfuscated or harmful code segments.",
