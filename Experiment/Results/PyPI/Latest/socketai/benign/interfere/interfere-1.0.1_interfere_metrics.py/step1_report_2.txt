{
  "purpose": "The code defines various metrics and utility functions for evaluating counterfactual forecasting models, including statistical tests, error calculations, and comparison metrics.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from numpy arrays passed to metric functions, and possibly imports modules from the same package (e.g., .interventions, .utils).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system command execution.",
  "flows": "The data flows involve input numpy arrays processed through statistical calculations and array manipulations; no external untrusted data or outputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code primarily performs mathematical and statistical computations using well-known libraries (numpy, scipy).",
  "analysis": "The code implements various forecasting metrics and statistical tests with clear structure and standard functions. The functions perform array operations, statistical tests, and error metrics without unusual constructs. There is no evidence of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior. All imported modules appear standard or utility functions for documentation copying. No network or file I/O operations are present, reducing suspicion. The use of external libraries (numpy, scipy) is typical for such tasks. The code’s purpose is analytical evaluation, not system interaction or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of statistical and forecasting evaluation metrics with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs data analysis tasks relevant to model evaluation without any harmful behavior.",
