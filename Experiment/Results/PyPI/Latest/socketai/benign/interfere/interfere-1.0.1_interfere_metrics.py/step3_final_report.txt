{
  "purpose": "Provides a suite of evaluation metrics for counterfactual forecasting in time series data, including error measures and statistical tests.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays (X, X_do, X_do_pred) and intervention indices; no external data sources or inputs beyond function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications; computations are self-contained and only involve array operations and statistical calculations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through statistical and error computations within class methods; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code uses standard libraries and functions, with no obfuscation or malicious routines.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard statistical and error metrics for evaluating time series forecasting models, relying solely on numpy and scipy. It contains no network, file I/O, or system modification operations. The functions perform legitimate calculations, and the class structures are typical for such evaluation tools. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is transparent and aligned with common scientific computing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of evaluation metrics for counterfactual time series forecasting. No malicious or security risks are present. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the code can be considered safe and non-obfuscated.",
