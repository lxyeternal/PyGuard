  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for simulating stochastic and deterministic coupled map lattices, including various parameterizations and boundary conditions, primarily for modeling complex dynamical systems.",
  "sources": "Input data can come from external parameters such as adjacency matrices, initial states, or stochastic noise parameters; also from functions passed as `f` for map calculations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks such as network communications, file I/O, or system modifications. It primarily computes numerical simulations locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (initial states, adjacency matrices, noise parameters) through the `step()` and `_simulate()` methods to produce state trajectories. There are no external data exfiltration or external command execution flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a scientific simulation; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are evident. All functions and classes serve legitimate modeling purposes. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for specific map functions (`logistic_map`, `quadradic_map`) and boundary handling (`mod_interval`). The core classes `CoupledMapLattice` and `StochasticCoupledMapLattice` implement standard numerical simulation techniques for coupled systems with optional stochastic noise and boundary conditions. The functions for parameterized models simply instantiate these classes with predefined parameters. The logic is straightforward, with no external communications, no file handling, and no suspicious side-effects. The presence of `copy_doc` suggests documentation copying, which is a standard practice. All code operates within the context of numerical simulation, and no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific simulation implementation for coupled map lattices, with no malicious code or security risks identified. It is well-structured, with no suspicious behaviors or backdoors. The functions and classes serve legitimate purposes related to modeling complex dynamical systems.",
