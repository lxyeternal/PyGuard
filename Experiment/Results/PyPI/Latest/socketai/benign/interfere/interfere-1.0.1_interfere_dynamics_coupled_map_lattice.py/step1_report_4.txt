  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for simulating stochastic and deterministic coupled map lattices, including various configurations and parameterizations, primarily for modeling complex dynamical systems.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from initial states prior to simulation, parameters like adjacency matrices, and random number generators for stochastic processes.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially influence the dynamics if externally supplied parameters (e.g., adjacency matrix, sigma, initial conditions) are maliciously crafted, but the code itself does not contain data leakage or insecure data handling mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Input data (initial states, parameters) influence the step functions and the simulation flow; stochastic noise added via rng.normal influences state updates; boundary conditions modify states to stay within specified ranges.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a custom mod_interval function which multiplies a modulo operation by (b - a) without explicitly ensuring the correctness of the operation; however, this appears to be a syntax error rather than malicious intent. The code also employs no suspicious or obscure constructs, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The implementation relies on standard scientific libraries and straightforward mathematical operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes and functions for simulating coupled map lattices, both deterministic and stochastic. It employs typical design patterns for dynamical systems, including parameter configuration, boundary conditions, and noise addition. The mod_interval function appears to contain a syntax error ('(x_mod[outside] % 1)' missing multiplication operator), which might lead to runtime errors, but no malicious behavior is evident. No code injections, backdoors, or suspicious network activities are present. The structure and logic are consistent with legitimate scientific modeling code.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage in the code. It appears to be a standard implementation for simulating complex dynamical systems using coupled map lattices. The only notable issue is a syntax error in the mod_interval function, which could prevent execution but does not indicate malicious intent.",
