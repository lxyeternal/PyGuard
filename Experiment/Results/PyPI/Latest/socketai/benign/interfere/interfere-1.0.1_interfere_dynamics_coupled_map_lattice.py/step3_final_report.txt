{
  "purpose": "The code implements simulation classes for stochastic and deterministic coupled map lattices, modeling complex dynamical systems with various configurations and parameters.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as adjacency matrices, initial states, and random number generators; function calls for maps and boundary conditions; RNG for stochastic noise.",
  "sinks": "No external data exfiltration or network communication; internal data flows through simulation steps and state updates.",
  "flows": "Input parameters feed into the simulation functions; the step functions compute next states; RNG introduces stochasticity; boundary conditions modify states as needed.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'mod_interval' contains a syntax bug: 'x_mod[outside] = a + (b - a)(x_mod[outside] % 1)' missing a multiplication operator before '(x_mod[outside] % 1)'. This is a bug, not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of coupled map lattice models, including stochastic variants. No suspicious external communication or malicious patterns are present. The main issue is a syntax error in 'mod_interval' which would cause runtime failure if uncorrected. The code structure and comments indicate legitimate scientific modeling purposes. No obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The syntax bug is a simple typo that should be fixed but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for simulation of dynamical systems, with a minor syntax bug that could affect execution. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
