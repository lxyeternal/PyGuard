  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions to simulate coupled map lattices, including stochastic variants, for complex dynamical systems analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data primarily from function arguments such as adjacency matrices, initial conditions, and parameters for maps. It also uses RNG for stochastic noise generation.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially flow into the RNG or the intervention functions if they are externally supplied, but the code itself does not include direct data leakage or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into class initializations, then into step functions where the state is updated. Noise is added through RNG, and boundary conditions are applied if specified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. The functions for the maps are simple mathematical functions. The mod_interval function has a syntax error: it attempts to multiply (a + (b - a))(x_mod[outside] % 1), which is invalid syntax and suggests a bug, not malicious intent. No obfuscated code, unusual variable names, or misleading constructs are present. The presence of only mathematical operations and class inheritance indicates typical scientific computation code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard scientific simulation of coupled map lattices with stochastic noise and boundary condition handling. The functions are well-structured for parameterized simulations. The only issue is a syntax error in 'mod_interval' function where 'x_mod[outside] = a + (b - a)(x_mod[outside] % 1)' should have a multiplication operator before the parentheses. This appears to be a bug rather than malicious code. No data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not contain hidden backdoors, suspicious network connections, or destructive commands.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical scientific modeling implementation for coupled map lattices with stochastic noise. The main concern is a syntax error in 'mod_interval', not malicious intent. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. The code appears to be for research or simulation purposes, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
