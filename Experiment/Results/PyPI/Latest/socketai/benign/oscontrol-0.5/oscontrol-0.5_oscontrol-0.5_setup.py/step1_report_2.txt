  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'oscontrol' Python library.",
  "sources": "N/A (no data input sources in this setup script).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no sinks or data output points that handle untrusted data).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow or execution flow involving untrusted input or output).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is a standard setup configuration using setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup.py file that specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion details. It sets the package name, version, author, and other metadata with no dynamic code, user input, or external data handling. The 'python_requires' field specifies an exact Python version (3.13.*), which is unusual but not malicious. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this file.",
