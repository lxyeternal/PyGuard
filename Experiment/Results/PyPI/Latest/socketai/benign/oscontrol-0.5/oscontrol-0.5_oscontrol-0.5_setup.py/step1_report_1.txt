{
  "purpose": "The setup.py file is used to define the packaging configuration for the 'oscontrol' Python library, facilitating its distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, packages list, description, author, python_requires, and classifiers from the script itself.",
  "targets": "There are no explicit untrusted data sources or user inputs; the script does not process external inputs or environment variables that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Since all data are statically defined, there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input leading to security concerns.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable aspect is the strict Python version requirement '==3.13.*', which is unusually specific and may cause installation issues, but it is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The hardcoded Python version is unusual but not malicious. The script appears to be a conventional setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a typical package configuration file with no malicious code or security risks detected. It simply specifies package metadata for distribution.",
