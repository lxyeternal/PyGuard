  "conclusion": "The code is benign, a standard package configuration script, with a minor configuration anomaly in the 'python_requires' field. This anomaly is not malicious but should be corrected to a valid version specifier to prevent installation issues. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score close to 0 (around 0.1), reflecting the non-malicious nature of the anomaly. Overall, the reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate, with the exception of the high security risk score in one report which overstates the concern."
