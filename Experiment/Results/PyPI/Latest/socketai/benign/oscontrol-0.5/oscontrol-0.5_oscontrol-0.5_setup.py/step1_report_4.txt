  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'oscontrol' Python library, facilitating installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading input or data; standard setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks; typical package setup flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual specification of Python version as '==3.13.*' which is a non-standard and likely invalid requirement specifier. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file using setuptools to define package metadata. The only unusual aspect is the 'python_requires' field set to '==3.13.*', which is invalid according to PEP 440 and common packaging practices. There are no indications of malicious code, hidden behavior, or security issues. The rest of the code is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with a potentially invalid Python version requirement. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this file. The primary concern is the invalid version specifier which might cause installation issues but does not pose security threats.",
