  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module for code obfuscation or licensing management.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the import could load runtime code, but no malicious sink behavior is apparent",
  "flows": "Import loads code from a relative module; no data flow from external untrusted sources is evident",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating trial version and expiration date; no unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement for a runtime component of Pyarmor, a known obfuscation tool. The comment specifies a trial version and expiration date, but this does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No data processing, external network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The code simply imports a runtime module, likely used for obfuscation or licensing enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of a legitimate obfuscation or licensing mechanism. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The presence of a trial comment suggests it is for a trial version of Pyarmor, with no indication of sabotage or malware.",
