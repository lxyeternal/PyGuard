  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for code protection or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the relative module '.pyarmor_runtime'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is being processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code simply imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicates the presence of Pyarmor trial version, but no malicious code or unusual behavior is present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a runtime module related to Pyarmor, a legitimate tool used for code obfuscation and licensing. The comment mentions a trial version and a date, but these are informational and do not suggest malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement related to Pyarmor runtime, with no signs of malicious activity. It appears to be part of an obfuscation or licensing mechanism rather than malicious code.",
