{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of the Pyarmor package, likely used for runtime obfuscation or licensing.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __pyarmor__ from a local module 'pyarmor_runtime'. No external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions present in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths observed; the code only imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of version, trial, and expiration date comments suggests licensing or trial management, but no malicious indicators. No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement from the Pyarmor package, with metadata comments indicating trial version and expiration date. No user input, external data, or suspicious behavior is evident. The import is standard for initializing runtime features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as part of the Pyarmor runtime or licensing mechanism without any malicious intent or behavior.",
