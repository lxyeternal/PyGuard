{
  "purpose": "The code imports the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely part of a licensing or obfuscation mechanism using Pyarmor.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module '.pyarmor_runtime' during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or external data outputs are present; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; the code only performs a straightforward import operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behaviors are present. The comments mention licensing details but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement from a local module, associated with Pyarmor, a legitimate obfuscation and licensing tool. No signs of obfuscation beyond standard licensing comments, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The comments about trial versions and expiration are typical licensing metadata, not indicators of malicious intent. The code does not perform any external communication, data processing, or malicious actions. Overall, the code is straightforward, legitimate, and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as part of a licensing or obfuscation framework using Pyarmor. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risky behavior is evident. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
