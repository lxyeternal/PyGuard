  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating trial version, which is common for licensed software, not malicious; no unusual code constructs or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a runtime module related to Pyarmor, a legitimate obfuscation and licensing tool for Python. The comment indicates a trial version, which is typical for licensing purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The code is minimal and standard for such tools, with no hidden or obfuscated elements beyond the normal scope of the library usage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement related to Pyarmor's runtime environment, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
