{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or licensing enforcement purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed",
  "flows": "Importing __pyarmor__ from the module, with no data flow beyond module loading",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating trial version and expiration date; no suspicious or malicious activity evident",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement from a local module named pyarmor_runtime. The comment mentions Pyarmor 9.0.6 trial, along with a timestamp and a license indicator. No code execution, data processing, or network activity is present. The import suggests use of Pyarmor's runtime, likely for obfuscation or license management. No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward import statement for Pyarmor runtime functions, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. The mention of a trial version and timestamp is consistent with licensing metadata and does not indicate malicious behavior.",
