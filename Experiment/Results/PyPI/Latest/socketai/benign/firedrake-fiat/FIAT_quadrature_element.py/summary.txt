  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a finite element quadrature class used in scientific computing. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores across reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (0 to 0.1)."
