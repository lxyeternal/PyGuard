{
  "purpose": "The code defines finite element spaces, dual sets, and related functions for high-order triangular and tetrahedral elements, primarily for use in finite element method computations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (ref_el, degree), and from imported modules (FIAT, reference_element, create_quadrature).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any evident sinks where untrusted data is used to affect the system maliciously; no network or file system operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and imported functions to object initializations, dual set creation, and element construction, with no untrusted data being used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are observed. The code appears standard for finite element implementation, with straightforward logic and no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to implement standard finite element space definitions and dual basis constructions without any network, file, or system command execution. It mainly manipulates geometric and mathematical data relevant to finite element analysis. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious data handling is evident. The code strictly adheres to its mathematical purpose, with clear structure and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of finite element basis functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only performs mathematical and geometric computations related to finite element spaces.",
