  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for creating, manipulating, and projecting polynomial sets used in finite element analysis, specifically for reference elements, orthonormal bases, tensor-valued polynomials, and bubble functions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include polynomial degrees, shape parameters, reference element objects, and quadrature rule objects. Input functions are f(x) in the project function. Data is read from method calls such as get_points() and get_weights() from quadrature objects, as well as attributes from reference elements and expansion sets.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the project() function which computes expansion coefficients using quadrature; numpy dot products and array operations that process input data; creation and modification of polynomial coefficient arrays; and the use of expansion set tabulation methods.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input functions (like f(x), quadrature points, weights) through tabulation and dot product operations in project(). Coefficients are manipulated via concatenation, padding, and basis transformations. The constructed polynomial sets are based on these coefficients and expansion sets, with some flows involving the creation of orthonormal or special tensor basis sets.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code structures are evident. The code performs mathematical operations consistent with polynomial basis construction. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The functions are well-documented and appear standard for finite element basis management.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily mathematical and algorithmic, involving polynomial basis construction, orthonormalization, tensor operations, and projections. All functions rely on standard numerical linear algebra (NumPy) and well-understood finite element methods. There are no signs of hidden network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious system manipulation. Usage of input data appears controlled and limited to polynomial basis calculations, with no suspicious data flows outside of legitimate mathematical procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate library for polynomial set management in finite element analysis. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It performs standard basis construction, projection, and manipulation routines with no suspicious side effects. The implementation is consistent with typical mathematical software used in scientific computing.",
