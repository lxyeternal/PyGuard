  "conclusion": "The code is a transparent, well-structured scientific library for finite element basis management with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The potential for resource exhaustion via user-defined functions exists but is a known aspect of such numerical routines, not a security flaw. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk."
