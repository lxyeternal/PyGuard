  "purpose": "Implementation of finite element basis functions, permutation handling, and node evaluation for Lagrange elements within the FIAT library, supporting both discontinuous and broken element variants.",
  "sources": "Data is generated internally through geometric and topological methods; no external data, network, or file I/O involved.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network connections, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Permutation functions generate entity and DoF mappings; basis classes utilize point evaluation and polynomial sets; data flows from reference element definitions through permutation and basis construction to final element instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Permutation functions are complex but serve legitimate finite element purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs finite element basis functions, permutation mappings, and dual basis sets for simplices of any dimension. Permutation functions are intricate but necessary for mesh and basis management. No external system calls, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The code aligns with standard finite element methodologies, and the complexity reflects mathematical requirements rather than obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of finite element basis functions with complex but justified permutation logic. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is minimal.",
