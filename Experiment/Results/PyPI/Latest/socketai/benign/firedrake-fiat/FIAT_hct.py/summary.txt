  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of HCT finite element basis functions, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The high risk score in the initial reports (e.g., 0.95) appears overly cautious; a more accurate assessment would assign a very low risk (~0.0 to 0.1). The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for scientific use."
