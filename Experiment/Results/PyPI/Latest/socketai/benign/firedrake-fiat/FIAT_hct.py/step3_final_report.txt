  "purpose": "Defines classes for HCT macroelement, dual set, and basis functions for finite element analysis on triangles.",
  "sources": "Reference geometries, quadrature points, polynomial evaluations, and geometric data from reference elements.",
  "sinks": "Internal data flows within geometric and polynomial computations; no external or untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reference geometries and quadrature points into polynomial evaluations and node constructions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard finite element operations: geometric validation, polynomial basis construction, quadrature, and node setup. It uses typical patterns for scientific computing, with input validation and geometric data handling. No external network or file interactions are present. The structure is transparent and consistent with finite element software practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of HCT finite element basis functions, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The high risk score in the initial reports (e.g., 0.95) appears overly cautious; a more accurate assessment would assign a very low risk (~0.0 to 0.1). The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for scientific use.",
