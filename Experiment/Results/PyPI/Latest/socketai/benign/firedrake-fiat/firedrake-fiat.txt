The potential for resource exhaustion via user-defined functions exists but is a known aspect of such numerical routines, not a security flaw. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of HCT finite element basis functions, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The high risk score in the initial reports (e.g., 0.95) appears overly cautious; a more accurate assessment would assign a very low risk (~0.0 to 0.1). The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for scientific use."

The only minor concern is potential numerical instability from matrix inversion, which is a known numerical issue but not a security risk."
