  "purpose": "The code constructs a dual basis for a finite element by using pointwise evaluations, aiding in finite element interpolation and basis representation.",
  "sources": "Reads input points (pts), finite element object (el), and the reference element (T) from el.ref_el.",
  "sinks": "Creates and returns DualSet containing functional evaluations; no external or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input points and finite element data are processed to produce a matrix of coefficients, which are then used to generate dual functionals; no external network or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no hidden network activity. Use of numpy.linalg.inv is standard for matrix inversion; no unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to compute a dual basis for a finite element. It performs shape assertions, retrieves spatial data, and inverts a matrix of point evaluations. The resulting coefficients form a set of functionals represented as evaluations at points. The process is mathematically grounded and standard for finite element dual basis construction. No malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Usage of numpy for linear algebra is typical; no dynamic code execution or suspicious operations are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for constructing a dual basis in finite element analysis. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and relies on common scientific computing practices. Overall, it appears safe and free from supply chain threats.",
