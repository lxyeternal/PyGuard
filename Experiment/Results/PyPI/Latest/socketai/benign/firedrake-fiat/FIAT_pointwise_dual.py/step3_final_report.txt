  "purpose": "Constructs a dual basis for a finite element basis using pointwise evaluations, facilitating interpolation and derivative approximations in finite element methods.",
  "sources": "Evaluation points provided as input; the finite element's reference element and tabulated basis evaluations.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks or network activity; computations are internal and self-contained.",
  "flows": "Input points are used to evaluate the basis, which are then assembled into a matrix, inverted, and used to derive dual functionals, which are stored in a DualSet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or external communication; standard numpy linear algebra operations are used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard finite element dual basis construction via pointwise evaluation and matrix inversion. It uses numpy for linear algebra, constructs functional objects, and returns a DualSet. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The use of np.linalg.inv() could pose numerical stability issues but is not malicious. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for scientific computing routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for finite element dual basis construction. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain threats. The only minor concern is potential numerical instability from matrix inversion, which is a known numerical issue but not a security risk.",
