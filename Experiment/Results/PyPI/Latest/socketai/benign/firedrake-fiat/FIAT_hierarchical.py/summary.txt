  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of finite element basis functions for Legendre and related elements. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and consistent with the code's purpose."
