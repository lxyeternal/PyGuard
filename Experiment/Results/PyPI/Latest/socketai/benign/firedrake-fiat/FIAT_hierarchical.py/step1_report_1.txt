  "purpose": "This code defines various classes and functions to generate dual basis functions and finite element spaces based on Legendre and integrated Legendre polynomials for finite element analysis, specifically for simplicial elements.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules such as numpy, FIAT, and related submodules. It also reads local data such as polynomial degrees, reference elements, and quadrature points.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems, files, or network. It performs mathematical operations, including solving linear systems and matrix multiplications, within the scope of finite element computations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (reference elements, degrees, variants) through mathematical transformations (quadrature, polynomial tabulation, matrix solving) within the classes and functions. There are no external untrusted data flows or command execution pathways.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard finite element computation patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious functions are observed. All operations are mathematical and within expected patterns for finite element methods.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily involves the creation of dual basis functions and finite element spaces for simplicial elements, utilizing quadrature and polynomial set tabulation. It constructs dual bases via matrix operations and polynomial evaluations. The functions and classes appear consistent with finite element methodology. No external system interactions, network communications, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is well-structured, follows standard patterns, and contains no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of finite element basis functions with no malicious behavior detected. It is focused on mathematical computation for finite element methods without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
