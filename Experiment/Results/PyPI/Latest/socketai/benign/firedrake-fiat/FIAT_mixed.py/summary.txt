  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard scientific computing component for finite element analysis, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
