{
  "purpose": "Implements a basic blockchain with voting and consensus mechanisms, including block creation, validation, and export functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters (votes, node info), timestamp (system time), and file I/O for saving JSON.",
  "sinks": "Writes to JSON file on disk, prints status messages, and computes hashes internally.",
  "flows": "Input votes -> create blocks -> propose blocks -> consensus (majority voting) -> export or save data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls. The code performs standard blockchain operations with no evident malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple blockchain with voting features, including hash calculations, block validation, consensus via majority agreement, and JSON data export. It uses standard libraries like hashlib, json, and time. No dynamic or external code execution, no suspicious network activity, or data exfiltration observed. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. The voting data is processed locally and exported to JSON, with no signs of malicious data leaks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious implementation of a blockchain with voting and consensus features. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious external behaviors. Overall security risk is low.",
