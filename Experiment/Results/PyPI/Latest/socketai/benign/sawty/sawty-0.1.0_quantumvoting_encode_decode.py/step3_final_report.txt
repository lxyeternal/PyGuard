  "purpose": "Provides XOR-based encoding and decoding of bitstrings using a shared secret key.",
  "sources": "Reads input as 'bitstring' and 'key' parameters; performs length check on 'key'.",
  "sinks": "Returns the encoded or decoded bitstring; no external data sinks or transmissions.",
  "flows": "Source: input parameters -> XOR operation -> output bitstring.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple XOR cipher for bitstrings, with proper length validation. It uses XOR's symmetric property for decoding. No external data access, network activity, or side effects are present. The implementation is clear, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security utility is acknowledged, but it does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward XOR utility for bitstring obfuscation, with no malicious features or suspicious behavior. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, reflecting its minimal security utility but lack of malicious intent.",
