{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encode and decode a bitstring using XOR encryption with a shared secret key.",
  "sources": "The functions read input parameters: 'bitstring', 'encoded_bitstring', and 'key'.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform XOR operations that could be used to obfuscate data, but do not directly write or transmit data to external sources.",
  "flows": "Input 'bitstring' and 'key' are combined through XOR in 'encode_bitstring'; the 'decode_bitstring' reuses the encoding function, creating a source-to-sink flow for encryption/decryption.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The code performs simple XOR-based encoding/decoding.",
  "analysis": "The functions implement basic XOR encryption, which is symmetric and straightforward. The key length check ensures proper operation. There are no external data sources or sinks, no obfuscated code, and no signs of malicious intent. The code is simple and self-contained, focusing solely on data transformation without side effects. It does not include any network activity, file I/O, or sensitive data handling beyond parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of XOR-based encoding/decoding with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs basic data transformation intended for simple obfuscation or encryption purposes.",
