  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'sawty' related to quantum-secure blockchain voting.",
  "sources": "N/A - the code does not read external input or data; sources are the static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "N/A - the code does not write data to untrusted locations or perform any external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A - there are no data flows from sources to sinks within this script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be a standard setup script without suspicious or unusual elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools for packaging. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. It references standard libraries and dependencies (qiskit, cryptography) without any embedded code or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward, legitimate setup configuration for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
