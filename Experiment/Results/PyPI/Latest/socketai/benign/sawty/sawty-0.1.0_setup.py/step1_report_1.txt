{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'sawty', related to a quantum-secure blockchain voting system.",
  "sources": "Code reads package dependencies ('install_requires') and package metadata (name, version, description, author, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external effects; standard setup configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A – straightforward package setup without data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed. The setup script is typical and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies, which is standard practice. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated sections, or suspicious operations. Dependencies are common cryptography and quantum computing libraries, aligned with described functionality. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident in this setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup code appears legitimate and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures the package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
