{
  "purpose": "Define the package configuration and dependencies for the 'sawty' Python project, which is described as a quantum-secure blockchain voting system.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, description, author, author_email, url, packages, install_requires, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic or untrusted data sources; no user input, network connections, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the script solely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. All code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, then calls setup() with static, well-formed parameters describing package metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic imports, eval, exec, or external data reads. No embedded or hidden malicious logic, code injection, or obfuscated constructs are present. The package description mentions quantum security and cryptography, but this appears to be a legitimate description aligned with declared dependencies (qiskit, cryptography).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies in a typical manner. No indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious code are present.",
