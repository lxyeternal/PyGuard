{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'sawty', including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Static values within setup() function such as name, version, description, author, author_email, url, packages, install_requires, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources, network calls, or data outputs; only static configuration data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration data is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward package setup without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for Python package distribution. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and compatibility. All values are static, well-formed, and typical for Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No dynamic execution, input handling, or network activity is present. The dependencies listed ('qiskit' and 'cryptography') are common in cryptography and quantum computing projects, aligned with the package description.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It serves purely as package configuration with no suspicious behaviors or hidden malicious activities.",
