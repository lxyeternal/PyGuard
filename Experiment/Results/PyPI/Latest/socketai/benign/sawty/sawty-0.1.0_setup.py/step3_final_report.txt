  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for the 'sawty' Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields in setup(), such as name, version, description, author, url, and install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses common libraries without obfuscation or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with static package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or external data handling is present. Dependencies are common in cryptography and quantum computing projects, aligning with the package's purpose. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or network activity are detected. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence. The code's static nature and alignment with standard practices justify these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is legitimate, static, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating no security risks or malware. No modifications are necessary.",
