{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'sawty', a blockchain voting system with quantum key distribution features.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from package metadata fields and requirements lists, such as 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or execution; the script primarily prepares package metadata for installation.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows detected; the package information is static and used for setup only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. All code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external data sources are involved. The dependencies listed ('qiskit' and 'cryptography') are standard cryptography and quantum computing libraries, aligned with the package's description. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and typical for Python package distribution. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation within this code.",
