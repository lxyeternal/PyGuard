  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It's a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n- Defines package metadata: name, version, description, author info, URL.\n- Specifies dependencies: `qiskit` and `cryptography`.\n- Uses static values; no dynamic code, obfuscation, or external input.\n- No network calls, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code appears typical for Python package distribution.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as package setup configuration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior, standard dependencies, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, Risk: 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms standard setup script with static data.\n- No suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n- Malware score: 0, risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Repeats the same conclusion: standard, benign setup script.\n- No dynamic code, obfuscation, or external data.\n- Malware: 0, risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same consistent findings: straightforward package configuration.\n- No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- Malware: 0, risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also finds no anomalies, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- Standard dependencies and static configuration.\n- Malware: 0, risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is exactly as provided, a typical `setup.py` script with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports agree on no malware or obfuscation, which aligns with the code.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is benign, the risk score should be 0. The reports currently assign a risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly 0; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Confidence:** All reports are confident (1), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The current scores are consistent and justified.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code appears entirely legitimate, with no indication of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus among all reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The current scoring reflects this accurately.",
