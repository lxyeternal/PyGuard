  "purpose": "Implement secure quantum key distribution (QKD), digital signatures, and message exchange between nodes in a quantum voting system.",
  "sources": "create_shared_key (input parameters), encode_bitstring (message + key), CryptoManager.generate_keys (key generation), CryptoManager.sign_message (signing), CryptoManager.verify_signature (verification).",
  "sinks": "Return values of encode_bitstring, sign_message, verify_signature, and the final message payloads containing encoded message and signatures.",
  "flows": "Shared key generated by create_shared_key is used for encoding and decoding messages; private key signs messages; public key verifies signatures; message flows from sender to receiver with attached signature; receiver verifies and decodes message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures; standard cryptographic procedures are used. The exception handling in QKD establishment is typical, not suspicious. No suspicious data leakage or hidden code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Node class for establishing QKD channels and secure message exchange using digital signatures. QKD creation relies on an external function create_shared_key, which is presumably secure. The node generates key pairs via CryptoManager. Message signing and verification are performed correctly, with signatures appended to messages. Error handling is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or obfuscated code present. The code appears to implement intended cryptographic practices without malicious or maliciously disguised behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a secure communication component using quantum-derived keys and digital signatures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security flaws within this code segment. It appears to be legitimate and secure.",
