{
  "purpose": "Implements a Node class for establishing quantum key distribution (QKD) channels, signing messages, encoding/decoding bitstrings, and verifying signatures to facilitate secure communication between nodes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data during message sending (message_bits), QKD channel establishment (create_shared_key), and signature verification (public keys, incoming payload).",
  "sinks": "Uses shared keys for encoding messages, signature verification functions, and exception handling to prevent malformed or malicious inputs from causing security issues.",
  "flows": "Source: message_bits and shared keys; Sink: encoded messages, signatures, and verification functions; Flow: message_bits -> encode_bitstring -> sign_message -> send; incoming_payload -> verify_signature -> decode_bitstring -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. External functions are assumed secure; no backdoors or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard cryptographic practices, establishing QKD channels with retries, signing messages with private keys, verifying signatures with stored public keys, and encoding messages with shared keys. Exception handling is appropriate, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident. The reliance on external cryptographic functions is typical but assumes their security. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious loops are present. The overall structure is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of secure quantum key distribution communication with digital signatures. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects standard cryptographic practices and the reliance on external libraries, which should be verified in deployment but are not inherently suspicious.",
