  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code's logic, and the scoring consistency.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements a Node class for establishing QKD channels, signing messages, and verifying signatures.\n- Uses external functions for QKD creation (`create_shared_key`), encoding/decoding (`encode_bitstring`, `decode_bitstring`), and cryptography (`CryptoManager`).\n- Handles retries for QKD, signs messages with private keys, verifies signatures with public keys, and encodes messages with shared keys.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n- The reports mostly describe standard cryptographic operations, key exchange, signing, verification, and encoding.  \n- No anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious code are evident.  \n- The code relies on external libraries/functions, which is standard.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n- The reports assume external functions (`create_shared_key`, `encode_bitstring`, etc.) are secure and correctly implemented, which is reasonable but should be explicitly noted as an assumption.  \n- They do not identify any actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors in the code itself.  \n- The reasoning is consistent; no false claims are evident.\n\n**3. Are the scores appropriate?**  \n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.  \n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with standard cryptographic practices.  \n- Confidence scores are high (0.9), justified by the clear, straightforward implementation.\n\n**4. Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):**  \n- No issues justify higher risk scores.  \n- The code appears to implement standard secure communication mechanisms without evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**  \n- The code does not exhibit malicious behavior; no backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present.  \n- External functions are assumed secure; no evidence suggests malicious intent.\n\n**6. Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n- The reports correctly treat the external cryptographic functions as trusted.  \n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond standard cryptography.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**  \n- All scores are consistent with the analysis; no contradictions are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0**. No malware or malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- **0**, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- **Should be around 0.1-0.2**, reflecting standard cryptographic practices and proper exception handling.\n\n**Additional considerations:**  \n- The external functions' security is assumed but not verified here; however, that is standard practice in such analyses.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Score Type       | Suggested Value | Justification                                                                 |\n|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious behavior detected.                                               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Code is clear, no obfuscation observed.                                       |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1 - 0.2         | Low risk; standard cryptographic procedures, proper exception handling.    |\n\n---\n\n### **Final note:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. No modifications are necessary. The code appears secure, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
