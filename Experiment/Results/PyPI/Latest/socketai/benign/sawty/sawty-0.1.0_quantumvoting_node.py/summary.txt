  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of secure quantum key distribution communication with digital signatures. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects standard cryptographic practices and the reliance on external libraries, which should be verified in deployment but are not inherently suspicious."
