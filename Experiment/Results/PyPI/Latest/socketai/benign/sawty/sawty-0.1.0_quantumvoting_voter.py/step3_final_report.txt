  "purpose": "Implements a voting node that signs identity and votes, encrypts votes, and transmits payloads securely within a quantum voting system.",
  "sources": "self.id, self.private_key, vote_index, self.send_message(auth_node, vote_bits), self.signature, message_bytes",
  "sinks": "send_message (transmitting encrypted vote), CryptoManager.sign_message (signing identity and vote), payload (containing signature and encrypted vote)",
  "flows": "vote_index converted to binary bits -> encrypted via send_message -> message_bytes signed -> payload assembled with signature and encrypted vote -> transmitted via send_message",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward cryptographic operations; no unusual data handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Voter class that signs its identity and votes using CryptoManager, encrypts votes via send_message, and constructs payloads with signatures and encrypted data. It relies on external modules assumed to be secure. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or insecure practices are present. The cryptographic procedures follow standard practices, and the code structure is clear. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to message transmission, which is typical in such systems. Overall, the code appears legitimate, secure, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of a voting node with cryptographic signing and encryption. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the cryptographic context. The code and reports are consistent and justified.",
