  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of a voting node with cryptographic signing and encryption. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the cryptographic context. The code and reports are consistent and justified."
