{
  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only import statements from various modules related to cryptography, blockchain, voting, and network functionalities, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: voter, authenticator, tallier, blockchain, digital_signature, qkd, node, encode_decode",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this snippet; no data leaks or external communications are evident here.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports modules without executing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in the static import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static set of import statements from modules that suggest cryptographic and blockchain functionalities. No executable code, data handling, or network activity is present. The absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues is confirmed by the straightforward nature of the snippet. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and the malware scores correctly indicate no malicious intent. The code's benign nature aligns with the assessments provided, and no further action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The import statements are standard and do not contain malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's static, benign nature.",
