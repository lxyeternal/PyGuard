  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard simulation of a quantum key distribution protocol with attack modeling. It contains no malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The primary concern is the verbosity of logs, which could be sensitive if exposed, but this does not constitute a security threat. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior."
