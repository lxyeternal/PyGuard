  "purpose": "Simulation of a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol using quantum circuits, including attack modeling, basis choice, measurement, and verification.",
  "sources": "Quantum circuit operations for basis selection, measurement, and attack simulation; random number generation for basis and attack decisions.",
  "sinks": "Logging of attack details, basis hashes, measurement results, and error rates; no external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Quantum circuit creation and measurement -> attack simulation via classical randomness -> basis hash verification -> error rate analysis -> final key derivation.",
  "anomalies": "Verbose attack logs and basis hashes; no malicious code or backdoors; attack modeling is for simulation purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard QKD simulation with probabilistic eavesdropping modeling. It uses quantum circuits for basis-dependent measurements and classical randomness for attack simulation. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration or backdoors, are present. The logs are detailed but serve debugging or educational purposes. The hashing and verification steps are correctly implemented. The randomness sources are appropriate for a simulation context. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard simulation of a quantum key distribution protocol with attack modeling. It contains no malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The primary concern is the verbosity of logs, which could be sensitive if exposed, but this does not constitute a security threat. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
