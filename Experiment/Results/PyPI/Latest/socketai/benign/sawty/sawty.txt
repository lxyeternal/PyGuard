The primary concern is the verbosity of logs, which could be sensitive if exposed, but this does not constitute a security threat. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior."

No malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects standard cryptographic practices and the reliance on external libraries, which should be verified in deployment but are not inherently suspicious."
