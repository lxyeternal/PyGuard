  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence provided, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward cryptographic utility implementing RSA key generation, signing, and verification.\n- The default key size is 1024 bits, which is considered insecure today but not malicious.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns are observed.\n- No obfuscation, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are indicated.\n- The print statements in verification are minimal and do not leak sensitive info.\n- The code uses standard cryptography libraries and practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description in all reports.\n- No issues are present that would suggest malicious intent.\n- The only concern is the weak default key size (1024 bits), which is security-related but not malicious.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The primary flaw is the use of a 1024-bit RSA key, which is considered insecure for modern cryptography standards (2048 bits or higher recommended). This is acknowledged in the reports.\n- No logical errors or suspicious code constructs are evident.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis. No signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.2, mainly due to the weak key size. This is reasonable; it's a security concern but not an active vulnerability or malicious.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The only adjustment I might suggest is emphasizing that the low key size is a security vulnerability, but not malware or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward and clear.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.2** — reflects the insecure key size, which is a security concern but not an active threat.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard cryptographic utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The main issue is the outdated key size, which should be upgraded for security purposes but does not constitute malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Value | Justification                                                      |\n|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious activity or code patterns identified.                 |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | Code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard libraries.      |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2          | Due to the use of 1024-bit RSA keys, which are insecure today.     |\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to prepare a summarized report or further analyze specific aspects.",
