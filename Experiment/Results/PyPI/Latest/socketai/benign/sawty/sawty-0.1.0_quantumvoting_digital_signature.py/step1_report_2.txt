{
  "purpose": "This code provides cryptographic functionalities such as key generation, message signing, and signature verification using RSA algorithm.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'message' parameter in 'sign_message' and 'verify_signature' functions, and the 'private_key' and 'public_key' objects passed into these functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'print' statement within 'verify_signature' which outputs verification failure messages. Key generation outputs private and public keys.",
  "flows": "The 'message' flows from external input into 'sign_message' and 'verify_signature'. Private key is used to sign the message, producing a signature which can then be verified with the public key, indicating a source-to-sink flow for signature validation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets. The key size default is 1024 bits, which is considered insecure by modern standards, but this is not malicious intent, just insecure configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements RSA key generation, signing, and verification with standard cryptography libraries. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious data leaks, and no use of unsafe functions are present. The only concern is the weak default key size (1024 bits), which is insecure but not malicious. The verification function prints errors rather than raising exceptions, which could be seen as a minimal information leak, but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be standard cryptographic utility code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward cryptography utility implementing key generation, signing, and verification. No malicious behavior or supply chain security threats are evident. The only concern is the weak default key size, which should be updated for security best practices.",
