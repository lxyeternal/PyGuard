{
  "purpose": "Provides cryptographic key generation, signing, and verification functionalities using RSA and PSS padding.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: rsa_key_size, private_key, message, public_key, signature",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; cryptographic operations are contained within the class",
  "flows": "generate_keys -> sign_message -> verify_signature, with data flow from keys and messages to verification outcomes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The key size defaults to 1024, which is weak but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic operations: generating RSA keys, signing messages, and verifying signatures. It uses appropriate padding (PSS) and hashing (SHA256). No external data is fetched or transmitted; all data is passed as function arguments. The default key size (1024 bits) is considered insecure for modern standards but not malicious. The try-except block for verification logs errors but does not leak sensitive information. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward cryptographic utility with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic utility implementing RSA key generation, signing, and verification. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected. The only potential concern is the weak default key size, but this is not malicious. No malware signals are present.",
