  "purpose": "The code provides cryptographic functions for generating RSA key pairs, signing messages, and verifying signatures.",
  "sources": "The RSA key generation (generate_keys) and message input parameters for signing and verification.",
  "sinks": "Signature verification output, error messages printed during verification failure.",
  "flows": "Input message flows into sign_message and verify_signature functions; signatures are created and verified; verification errors are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of RSA key generation with fixed size is standard, although 1024 bits is outdated for high security. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cryptography modules and defines a CryptoManager class with static methods for key generation, signing, and verification. The generate_keys method creates an RSA key pair with a default size of 1024 bits, which is considered insecure by modern standards but not malicious. The sign_message method signs input messages with the private key using PSS padding and SHA256 hash. The verify_signature method attempts to verify signatures and prints verification failures, catching exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. The code performs standard cryptographic operations, adhering to best practices for signature schemes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard cryptographic utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It provides RSA key generation, signing, and verification functionalities in a straightforward manner. The use of a small key size (1024 bits) is insecure but not malicious. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
