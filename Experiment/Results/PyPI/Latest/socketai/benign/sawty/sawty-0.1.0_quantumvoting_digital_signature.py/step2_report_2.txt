  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- Implements RSA key generation, signing, and verification.\n- Uses 1024-bit RSA keys by default, which is insecure but not malicious.\n- Uses standard cryptographic primitives (PSS padding, SHA256).\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.\n- Errors during verification are printed, which is benign.\n- No external data leaks or malicious operations observed.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code functions as described; no issues with correctness or malicious behavior.\n- The only concern is the use of a 1024-bit RSA key, which is insecure today but not malicious.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Key size**: Default of 1024 bits is outdated and insecure; recommended to use 2048 bits or higher.\n- No other flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **malware: 0**\n  - **securityRisk: 0.2** (due to weak key size)\n  - **obfuscated: 0**\n  - **confidence: 0.9**\n\nThese are consistent with the code's analysis.\n\n### Justification for Risk and Malware Scores:\n- **Malware score (0)**: No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Security risk (0.2)**: Due to the weak default key size, which could compromise security but is not malicious.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- No report claims or implies the code is malicious or obfuscated.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The only \"issue\" is insecure key size, which is a configuration/security concern, not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign with a minor security concern.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0.2 (due to weak key size, which could be exploited in practice but is not malicious)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard cryptographic utility with no malicious intent. The only issue is the insecure key size, which should be updated for security reasons. All reports are consistent and accurate in their evaluations.\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is benign but should be updated to use at least 2048-bit RSA keys for better security.",
