{
  "purpose": "Provide cryptographic key generation, signing, and verification functionalities using RSA.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; methods accept parameters such as private keys, messages, signatures, and key sizes.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; cryptographic operations are internal and do not leak data or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "Generate_keys creates keys; sign_message signs data with a private key; verify_signature verifies signatures with a public key.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard cryptography library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for RSA key generation, message signing, and signature verification using the 'cryptography' library. It generates RSA keys with a default size of 1024 bits, which is considered insecure by modern standards but not malicious. Signing and verification are straightforward and follow standard practices. No input/output operations, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors are detected. Overall, the code performs standard cryptographic functions with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides standard cryptographic utilities without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious functionality. The main concern is the use of a 1024-bit key size, which is outdated for security but not malicious. Overall, it appears to be a benign cryptography helper class.",
