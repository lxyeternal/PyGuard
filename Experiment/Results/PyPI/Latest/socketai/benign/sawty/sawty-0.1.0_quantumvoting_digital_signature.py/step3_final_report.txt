{
  "purpose": "Provides RSA key generation, signing, and verification functionalities using standard cryptographic primitives.",
  "sources": "Input message for signing and verification, private and public key objects.",
  "sinks": "Verification method outputs success or failure; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input message flows into sign_message and verify_signature; keys are used directly without external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard RSA cryptography with key generation, signing, and verification. Default key size is 1024 bits, which is insecure but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. Exception handling in verification merely logs errors. No external data exfiltration or network activity is observed. The code's structure and logic are clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign cryptographic utility performing RSA operations. The only security concern is the use of a 1024-bit key, which should be upgraded for better security. There is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior.",
