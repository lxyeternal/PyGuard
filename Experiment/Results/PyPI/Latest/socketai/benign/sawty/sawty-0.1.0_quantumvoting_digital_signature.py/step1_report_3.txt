  "purpose": "Provides cryptographic key generation, message signing, and signature verification functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: rsa_key_size, message, private_key, public_key, signature.",
  "sinks": "Return values: private_key, public_key, signature, verification status; print statement in verify_signature.",
  "flows": "generate_keys -> private_key, public_key; sign_message -> private_key, message -> signature; verify_signature -> public_key, message, signature -> verification result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The use of standard cryptographic primitives is appropriate and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for cryptographic operations using standard cryptography library functions. Key generation uses RSA with 1024 bits, which is considered weak by modern standards but not malicious. Signing and verification are straightforward, employing PSS padding with SHA-256 hash, which is secure. The verify_signature method handles exceptions gracefully, printing verification failures without exposing sensitive info. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data flows. The code appears to be a standard implementation of cryptographic utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard cryptographic functions without any malicious behavior or security flaws evident from the source. It does not contain backdoors or malicious data leaks. The use of 1024-bit RSA is outdated but not malicious; upgrading to 2048-bit RSA is recommended for security.",
