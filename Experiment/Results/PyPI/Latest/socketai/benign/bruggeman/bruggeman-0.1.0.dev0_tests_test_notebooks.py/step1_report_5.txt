{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to locate Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) in specified directories, execute them to verify they run without errors, and optionally clear their outputs and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads notebook files from the filesystem using os.listdir and opens each notebook file with open().",
  "sinks": "The code executes notebooks via nbconvert's ExecutePreprocessor and clears outputs using os.system with jupyter nbconvert command.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading notebook files (sources), executing them with ExecutePreprocessor (sink), and clearing outputs/metadata via system call (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. Usage of system() for executing shell commands is notable but standard for such tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically finds notebooks in specified directories, then executes each notebook to ensure they run successfully, catching exceptions. It also provides a command to clear notebook outputs and metadata. All actions are related to notebook validation and cleanup, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious activity. The code uses standard library functions and well-known packages without obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard notebook testing and cleanup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected tasks related to notebook validation and maintenance.",
