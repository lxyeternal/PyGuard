  "purpose": "Locate, execute, and clear outputs/metadata of notebooks in 'docs/examples' directory for testing and cleanup.",
  "sources": "Filenames obtained via os.listdir; notebooks read with nbformat; execution via nbconvert's ExecutePreprocessor; cleanup via os.system calling jupyter nbconvert.",
  "sinks": "Execution of notebooks which can run arbitrary code; clearing outputs and metadata via shell command.",
  "flows": "Filenames from os.listdir -> read with nbformat -> executed with ExecutePreprocessor -> outputs cleared with os.system command.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with static filenames; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; no external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code locates notebooks in a controlled directory, reads and executes them with standard tools, and clears outputs via a shell command. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The use of os.system with filenames derived from directory listing poses minimal risk in a controlled environment, but could be exploited if filenames are manipulated maliciously. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The malware score is appropriately zero; the low security risk score (0.2) reflects minor concerns about shell command execution, which are justified given the controlled context. Overall, the code is a standard utility for testing notebooks with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for testing and cleaning Jupyter notebooks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The minor risk associated with shell command execution is acceptable in this controlled environment. Scores are consistent with the code's behavior and security profile.",
