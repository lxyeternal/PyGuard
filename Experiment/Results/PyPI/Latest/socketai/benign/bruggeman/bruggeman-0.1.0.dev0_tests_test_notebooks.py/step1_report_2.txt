{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to locate Jupyter Notebook files in specific directories, execute them to verify correctness, and then clear their outputs and metadata for cleanup.",
  "sources": "Reading directory contents with os.listdir() to find '.ipynb' files; opening and reading notebook files with open() and nbformat.read().",
  "sinks": "Executing notebooks with nbconvert's ExecutePreprocessor, which runs arbitrary code; using os.system() to call Jupyter nbconvert for clearing output and metadata, which can execute shell commands.",
  "flows": "get_notebooks() reads files from disk -> test_notebook_py() loads and executes notebooks -> main block calls os.system() to clear notebook outputs and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() for executing shell commands, which can be dangerous if inputs are untrusted, but here inputs are static filenames. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation or malware-like activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code's main function is to locate '.ipynb' files in a specific directory, execute them programmatically to test for errors, and then clear outputs and metadata. The use of nbconvert's ExecutePreprocessor is standard for notebook testing. The os.system() call in the main block clears outputs and metadata from notebooks, which is a common cleanup step. No dynamic code execution, external network communication, or sensitive data handling is detected. All operations involve static files and standard libraries, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing and cleanup script for Jupyter notebooks. It performs directory listing, file reading, notebook execution, and cleanup in a standard manner. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The overall security risk is low.",
