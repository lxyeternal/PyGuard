  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Locates notebooks in \"docs/examples\" directory.\n- Reads each notebook with nbformat.\n- Executes notebooks with nbconvert's ExecutePreprocessor (timeout 600s).\n- Reports failures if execution fails.\n- In the main block, clears outputs and metadata using a shell command via os.system.\n\n**Security considerations:**\n- No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.\n- Uses standard libraries and tools.\n- Files are obtained via os.listdir; filenames are not influenced by user input.\n- The use of os.system with static filenames minimizes risk, but if filenames are manipulated, there could be shell injection risk—though unlikely here.\n- No network activity or data exfiltration.\n- The notebooks are executed, which can run arbitrary code, but this is expected for testing.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Testing and cleanup.\n- Analysis: No malicious intent, standard use of libraries.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.2 (low).\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Locate, execute, clear outputs.\n- Analysis: Similar to Report 1; notes that os.system is used but filenames are static.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.2.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Locate, execute, clear outputs.\n- Analysis: Same as above; no malicious activity, controlled filenames.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.2.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Locate, execute, clear outputs.\n- Analysis: Same as above; standard testing script.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.2.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Locate, execute, cleanup.\n- Analysis: Same as above; no suspicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.2.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** All are low (0.2), reflecting minor concerns about shell commands but controlled filenames.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The code appears safe and legitimate.\n- The use of `os.system` with static filenames is acceptable in this context, but in a more exposed environment, sanitization might be recommended.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected).\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code).\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minor risk due to shell command execution, but controlled).\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, safe utility for testing and cleaning notebooks, with minimal security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the current scoring and reasoning are appropriate.",
