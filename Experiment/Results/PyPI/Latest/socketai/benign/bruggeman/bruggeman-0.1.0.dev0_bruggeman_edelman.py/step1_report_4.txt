{
  "purpose": "The code defines two mathematical functions related to groundwater modeling, specifically Edelman functions for h and Qx, using numpy and scipy for calculations.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are function parameters: x, t, T, S, h, t_0.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input data leading to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in mathematical calculations; no data is transferred to external systems or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The use of standard mathematical functions and no dynamic code execution suggests normal behavior. The decorator is a standard function transformer, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions with mathematical formulas based on groundwater modeling. The functions rely solely on standard libraries (numpy, scipy) and a custom decorator imported from 'bruggeman.general'. The decorator modifies function behavior but is not inherently malicious. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are accessed or manipulated. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate scientific functions for groundwater modeling with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard mathematical libraries and straightforward calculations, with no malicious behavior detected.",
