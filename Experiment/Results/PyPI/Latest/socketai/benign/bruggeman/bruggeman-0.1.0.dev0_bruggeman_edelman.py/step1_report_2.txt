  "purpose": "Define functions for modeling groundwater flow using analytical solutions from 'Analyical Groundwater Modeling, ch. 5'.",
  "sources": "Importing 'exp', 'pi', 'sqrt' from numpy; 'erfc' from scipy.special; 'latexify_function' from bruggeman.general.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform calculations with inputs but do not include data outputs or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters x, t, T, S, h, t_0 are used to compute u, which feeds into erfc and exp functions, returning results.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or unusual code structures are present. Usage of mathematical libraries is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two mathematical functions involving square roots, exponential decay, and complementary error functions, typical for groundwater modeling. No external data or network activity occurs. The functions rely on imported mathematical functions and standard operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The purpose appears to be scientific computation, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of groundwater flow equations using standard scientific libraries. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malicious data handling, or security risks.",
