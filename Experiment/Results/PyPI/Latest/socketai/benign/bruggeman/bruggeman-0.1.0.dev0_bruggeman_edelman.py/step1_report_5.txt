{
  "purpose": "The code defines two mathematical functions, h_edelman and Qx_edelman, for use in groundwater modeling based on analytical solutions from groundwater science literature.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters: x, t, T, S, h, t_0, which are likely numerical values or arrays provided by the user or calling functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks or outputs that send data over networks, write files, or perform external system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to compute intermediate variables (u), which are then used in mathematical expressions to produce output values; no external data flows are evident beyond function inputs and outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code solely performs mathematical calculations using well-known libraries (numpy, scipy). The use of the @latexify_function decorator suggests formatting or documentation purposes, not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports well-known scientific libraries (numpy, scipy), and defines functions for mathematical modeling related to groundwater flow. The functions perform standard mathematical calculations involving erfc, exponentials, square roots, and basic algebra. No external network operations, file I/O, or potentially malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be an implementation of established scientific formulas with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of mathematical functions for groundwater modeling. It does not contain any malicious code or security risks. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
