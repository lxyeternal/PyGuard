  "purpose": "Implementing groundwater flow modeling functions using standard scientific formulas.",
  "sources": "Mathematical inputs such as x, t, T, S, h, t_0; no external data or network activity.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical functions; no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions performing standard scientific calculations with well-known libraries. No obfuscation, external data handling, or malicious behavior observed. The decorator appears for formatting, not malicious intent. All signals indicate a benign, scientific purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific implementation with no malicious activity or security risks. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
