{
  "purpose": "The code defines two mathematical functions related to analytical groundwater modeling, specifically for Edelman solutions, involving special functions from scipy and numpy.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the functions (x, t, T, S, h, t_0) and the imported modules numpy, scipy.special, and bruggeman.general.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical return values of the functions h_edelman and Qx_edelman, which are based on input parameters; no direct data leakage or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to compute variables u, which are then used in mathematical expressions involving erfc and exp, ultimately returning numerical results.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and primarily performs mathematical calculations; no hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or obfuscated code detected. The decorator from bruggeman.general may be for formatting or documentation but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries and applies a decorator for formatting or documentation purposes. The functions implement known groundwater flow equations using safe mathematical operations. There are no suspicious data handling, no dynamic code execution, no network interactions, and no indication of malicious logic. The purpose is clearly scientific computation. The code structure is clean, with no anomalies like hardcoded credentials or obscure code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of groundwater flow equations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves scientific purposes and contains no suspicious activities or backdoors.",
