{
  "purpose": "The code defines two mathematical functions, h_edelman and Qx_edelman, which are used for groundwater modeling calculations involving erfc and exponential functions.",
  "sources": "The functions read input parameters x, t, T, S, h, and optionally t_0.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leakage or security issues.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in calculations involving mathematical functions, with no external data flows or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no external or network operations present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports well-known scientific libraries (numpy and scipy), and defines two mathematical functions related to groundwater modeling. The functions perform straightforward mathematical calculations involving inputs and standard functions like sqrt, erfc, and exp. The use of a decorator from 'bruggeman.general' appears to be for formatting or documentation purposes, not for malicious activities. There are no indications of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious logic. No suspicious data handling or side effects are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical scientific computation module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate mathematical functions used for groundwater modeling, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
