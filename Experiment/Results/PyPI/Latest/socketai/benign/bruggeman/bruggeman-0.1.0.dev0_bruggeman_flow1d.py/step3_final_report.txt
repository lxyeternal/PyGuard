{
  "purpose": "The code implements hydrological and aquifer response models based on scientific literature, including solutions for water table rise, tidal fluctuations, and leaky aquifers.",
  "sources": "Mathematical functions such as erfc, sin, exp, sqrt, and complex number operations; input parameters from user or external data are processed within functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious data handling observed; functions produce numerical outputs based on inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical computations involving complex arithmetic and special functions, resulting in hydrological response values.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder functions ('pass') indicating incomplete features; use of complex numbers (1j) justified in modeling wave phenomena; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code models physical hydrological phenomena using standard mathematical functions and complex arithmetic typical in wave and response modeling. Placeholders suggest ongoing development but do not imply malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or hardcoded secrets are present. The complex number usage is justified within the physics context. The code is transparent, domain-specific, and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific modeling library with no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The incomplete functions are not malicious but indicate ongoing development. The overall security risk is minimal.",
