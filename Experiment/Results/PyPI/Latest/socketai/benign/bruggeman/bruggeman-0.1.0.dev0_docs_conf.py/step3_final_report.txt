  "purpose": "Static configuration for Sphinx documentation builder, defining project info, extensions, and HTML options.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments, list definitions, and configuration parameters within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data flows to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration with no data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, human-readable, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, standard Sphinx configuration file with no dynamic code, external input handling, or network activity. It contains only static strings, lists, and configuration parameters. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature make it inherently safe, with no potential for malicious payloads or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, which are appropriate given the static and safe nature of the code.",
