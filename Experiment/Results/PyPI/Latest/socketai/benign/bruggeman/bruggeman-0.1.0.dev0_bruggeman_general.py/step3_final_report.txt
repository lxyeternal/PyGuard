  "purpose": "Provides a decorator to convert Python functions into LaTeX format and defines a recursive function to compute the iterated integral of the complementary error function.",
  "sources": "The function arguments 'z' and 'n' in 'ierfc', and the optional 'latexify' library used within the decorator.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network, file I/O, or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'z' and 'n' flow into 'ierfc' for computation; optional 'latexify' dependency is used for formatting but does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries and defines a LaTeX conversion decorator with optional dependency handling. The 'ierfc' function implements a recursive mathematical computation with proper base cases and input validation. No external data flows, network activity, or malicious code are present. The optional 'latexify' library is handled gracefully, and the recursive function is mathematically sound. The code is straightforward, purpose-driven, and free of obfuscation or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, purpose-specific, and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the analysis and justified by the code's benign nature.",
