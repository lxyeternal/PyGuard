  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator to convert functions to LaTeX representations and implements an iterated integral complementary error function (ierfc).",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy and scipy, function arguments, and potential input parameters to ierfc such as z and n.",
  "sinks": "The ierfc function computes values based on its input; no untrusted data flow outside normal computation.",
  "flows": "Inputs z and n flow into ierfc, which performs recursive calculations with mathematical operations; no external or untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code. Use of recursive function is standard mathematical computation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports scientific libraries, defines a decorator for LaTeX conversion, and implements a mathematical function. The decorator attempts to import an optional library (latexify) and gracefully degrades if not present. The ierfc function handles special cases (n == -1 and n == 0) with straightforward mathematical expressions, and for other values uses a recursive calculation with clipping to restrict outputs. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate mathematical utility with an optional LaTeX rendering feature. It performs recursive mathematical calculations without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
