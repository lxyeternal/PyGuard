{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator for converting functions to LaTeX format and defines a mathematical function for the iterated complementary error function, likely for use in scientific or mathematical computations.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy and scipy.special, input parameters to functions, and the function call ierfc(z, n).",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data, external network, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The function ierfc takes input parameters z and n, performs recursive calculations, and returns a numerical value. No data flow to external systems or insecure operations is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are identified. The code appears standard for mathematical utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries, defines a decorator for LaTeX conversion, which gracefully handles missing dependencies, and a recursive mathematical function computing iterated integrals of the complementary error function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. The use of recursion in ierfc appears normal for mathematical calculations, and the decorator is straightforward with error handling. No hardcoded credentials, external network access, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard scientific utility module for mathematical function decoration and computation. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
