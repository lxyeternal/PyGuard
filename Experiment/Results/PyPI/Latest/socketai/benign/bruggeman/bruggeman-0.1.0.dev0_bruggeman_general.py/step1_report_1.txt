{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to convert functions into LaTeX representations and defines a mathematical function for the iterated complementary error function (ierfc).",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy and scipy, function parameters, and the function's input variables z and n.",
  "sinks": "The ierfc function returns numerical results; no data is sent over networks or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input variables z and n are used within ierfc to compute and return a numerical value; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors present. The use of imports is standard, and the only dynamic aspect is mathematical computation. The try-except block only manages optional dependency 'latexify', which is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries, defines a decorator for LaTeX conversion, and implements a recursive mathematical function. The decorator handles optional 'latexify' dependency gracefully, and the ierfc function performs recursive calls to compute iterated error functions with proper base cases. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and intended for mathematical and formatting purposes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
