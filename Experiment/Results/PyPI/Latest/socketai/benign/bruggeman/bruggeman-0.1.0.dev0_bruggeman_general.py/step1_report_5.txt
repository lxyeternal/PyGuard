{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator to convert functions into LaTeX format and implements an iterated integral complementary error function (ierfc).",
  "sources": "The code reads function definitions, docstrings, and input parameters such as z and n.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no untrusted data is written to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters z and n flow through the ierfc function, with recursive calls involved in computation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. The use of external libraries (numpy, scipy, and optional latexify) appears standard. The recursion in ierfc is mathematical, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a LaTeX decorator utility and a mathematical function, ierfc, which computes the iterated integral complementary error function using recursion and mathematical functions from numpy and scipy. The decorator attempts to import latexify and gracefully handles ImportError, indicating optional dependency handling. The ierfc function performs recursive calculations based on input parameters with no unsafe behaviors, no data leaks, and no suspicious external connections. There is no evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. The only external library usage (numpy, scipy, latexify) is appropriate for scientific computation and code decoration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and intended for mathematical and presentation purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
