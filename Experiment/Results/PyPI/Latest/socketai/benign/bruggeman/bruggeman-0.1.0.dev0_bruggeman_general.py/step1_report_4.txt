{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator for converting functions to LaTeX format and implements a mathematical function for the iterated integral complementary error function (ierfc).",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters 'z' and 'n' for the ierfc function and imports mathematical functions from numpy and scipy.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks. The only output is mathematical computation results.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'z' and 'n' flow into the ierfc function, which recursively computes values based on these inputs without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code imports standard libraries and contains straightforward recursive math functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides a LaTeX decorator wrapper and a mathematical recursive function for special functions. It imports only standard mathematical libraries (numpy and scipy) and contains no network, file I/O, or environment variable handling. No anomalies or malicious constructs are detected. The code appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and purpose-driven for mathematical computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate and intended for mathematical function decoration and calculation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code simply performs mathematical calculations and formatting, with no indications of malware or malicious intent.",
