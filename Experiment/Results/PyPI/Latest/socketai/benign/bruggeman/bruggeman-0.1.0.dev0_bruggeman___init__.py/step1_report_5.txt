  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no use of untrusted data or external inputs within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "The comment '# ruff: noqa: F401' suppresses linter warning about unused imports, which is a common practice and not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and a version attribute from an external package 'bruggeman'. The linter suppression comment indicates awareness of unused imports, but no actual processing or execution occurs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with a linter suppression comment. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
