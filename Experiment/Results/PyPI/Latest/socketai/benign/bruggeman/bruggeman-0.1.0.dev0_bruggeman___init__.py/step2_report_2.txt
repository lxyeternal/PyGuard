  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is just static import statements; no dynamic or malicious activity.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The report correctly notes the benign nature.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0, which is appropriate. The confidence score is 1, matching the certainty. No adjustments needed.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, static imports with a linter suppression comment.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues. The report accurately describes the benign nature.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0. The confidence is 1. No changes needed.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern, static imports with suppression comment.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0. The confidence is 0.9, which is reasonable given the simplicity. No adjustments needed.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Again, just imports with suppression comment, no dynamic code.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0.1, which is slightly above zero but justified given the pattern. The confidence score is 0.9, which is appropriate. No changes needed.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, benign static imports.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0, confidence is 1.  \n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All snippets are straightforward static import statements, with a linter suppression comment. There is no dynamic code, no data flow, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:** All are correctly set to 0, as there's no indication of malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated (0.1) in one report due to the suppression comment, but this is benign and common practice. No actual security risk is evident.  \n- **Confidence Scores:** Appropriately high given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports is justified.  \n- **Risk score:** Should remain low (around 0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature.  \n- **Additional notes:** No evidence suggests any malicious intent or security concern from these snippets. The suppression comment is standard practice and not indicative of malicious obfuscation or malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Confidence |\n|---------|---------|--------------|----------------|------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0              | 1          |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0              | 1          |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0              | 0.9        |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.1            | 0.9        |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0              | 1          |\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code snippets are benign static import statements with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
