  "sinks": "No untrusted data or user input handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code structures",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and version info from a package named 'bruggeman'. The comment indicates ignoring a linter warning about unused imports. The code does not include any data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. It appears to be a standard import statement setup typical for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this limited snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code solely performs static imports from a legitimate package, with no suspicious activity.",
