  "purpose": "Assigns version string for package versioning.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment in code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; only a variable assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flow; simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no inputs, outputs, data flows, or executable logic. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly interpret this as benign. The version string indicates a development build ('dev0'), which is typical during development phases. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, aligning with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action required.",
