  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   All reports describe the code as simply assigning a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or executable logic. The code is straightforward and typical in Python packages. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is minimal, standard, and non-malicious. No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0  \n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   - `obfuscated`: 0  \n   \n   These are appropriate given the code's simplicity. The confidence scores are all 1, which seems justified since the analysis is straightforward.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   Since all reports conclude no malicious activity or security risk, the risk scores should remain at 0. The code is purely declarative, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   The malware scores are all 0, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious intent or activity.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions**  \n   The reports assume that a version string assignment is benign, which is valid. No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are necessary here.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard version declaration, common in Python packages, with no inputs, outputs, or executable logic that could be malicious. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0. No further action needed.",
