  "purpose": "Defines the version of the Python package or module.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a development version string (__version__ = '0.1.0.dev0') could indicate a non-production build, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to the variable __version__. There are no inputs, outputs, or executable logic. The version string indicates a development version ('dev0'), which is common during development cycles and does not suggest malicious activity. No suspicious or unusual code features, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is typical in Python package development to specify versioning information in this manner.",
