  "flows": "No data flows present; the code only assigns a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a development version suffix '__dev0__', which is common in development releases and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to a variable, indicating the package version. It contains no input/output operations, no external data handling, and no code execution. The version string uses a standard format for development releases. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and typical for package version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple version assignment statement with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard in Python packages and shows no anomalies or malware indications.",
