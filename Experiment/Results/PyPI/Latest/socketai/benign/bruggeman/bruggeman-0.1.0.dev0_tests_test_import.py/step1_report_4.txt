  "anomalies": "Function is empty with no implementation, no unusual code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function named 'test_import' that does nothing and contains only a 'pass' statement. It does not perform any input/output operations, data processing, or use of external resources. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears to be a minimal placeholder or stub.",
