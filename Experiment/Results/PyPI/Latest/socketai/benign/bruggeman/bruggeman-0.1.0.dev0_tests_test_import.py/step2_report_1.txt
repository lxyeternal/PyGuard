  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple placeholder function `test_import` with no implementation, no data sources, sinks, or flows.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The code is benign and appears to be a stub for future development.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is minimal, harmless, and serves as a placeholder.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n   - The reports do not overstate risks or suggest false positives.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is justified because the analysis is straightforward and conclusive.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity or security issues, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - No justification exists for elevating the risk score, as the code is a benign placeholder.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - No concerns here.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a placeholder.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n   - The uniformity across reports indicates a clear consensus.\n\n**Final Summary & Personal Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. Given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I concur with the provided scores.\n\n**Overall, I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
