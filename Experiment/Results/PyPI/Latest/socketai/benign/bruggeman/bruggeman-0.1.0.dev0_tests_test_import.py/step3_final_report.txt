  "purpose": "A simple placeholder function `test_import` with no implementation, serving as a stub for future development.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function performs no operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, minimal, and contains only a pass statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal function definition with only a pass statement, indicating a placeholder. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows, and no suspicious or malicious behavior. The code is clear, unobfuscated, and serves as a stub for future implementation. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious intent are present, and the code does not perform any operations that could pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
