  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Actual Issues:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a simple placeholder function `test_import` that contains only a `pass` statement.\n   - There are no data sources, sinks, flows, or any operations performed.\n   - The code is minimal and appears to be a stub for future implementation.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - None of the reports indicate any malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n   - The code does not read external data, perform network operations, or execute any potentially harmful instructions.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign and a placeholder.\n   - They do not claim any vulnerabilities or malicious intent, which is correct given the code snippet.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is straightforward and lacks any obfuscation.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Confidence:** All are 1, indicating high confidence in their assessments.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores:**\n   - No issues are apparent; scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is just a placeholder, there's no reason to suspect hidden malicious intent.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risk present.\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, a simple placeholder, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the assessments in the reports.",
