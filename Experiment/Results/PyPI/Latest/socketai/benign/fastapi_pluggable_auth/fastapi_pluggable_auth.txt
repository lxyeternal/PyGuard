      "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code with a common security misconfiguration risk due to default secrets. Proper secret management is essential before deployment. No malware or obfuscation detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the main recommendation is to ensure secrets are securely set in production environments."

The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis. The overall security posture of this code snippet is very low risk and safe for use."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure JWT authentication dependency with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The external decode_token function should be verified separately, but based on the provided code and reports, the implementation is sound."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates moderate to high suspicion of malicious intent based on obfuscation and dynamic execution indicators. While no explicit payloads are confirmed, the patterns observed justify elevated malware and obfuscation scores. Slight score increases for reports with high obfuscation and suspicious patterns are recommended to better align with the observed traits. Overall, the assessments are consistent and appropriately cautious, emphasizing the need for further static or dynamic analysis before deployment."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. Minor concerns about input sanitization are outside the scope of this snippet. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and does not warrant higher risk or malware scores."

The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
