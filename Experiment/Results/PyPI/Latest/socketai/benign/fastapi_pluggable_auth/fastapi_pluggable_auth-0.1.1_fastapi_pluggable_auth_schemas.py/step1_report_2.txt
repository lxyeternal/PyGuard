  "purpose": "Define data schemas for user authentication and profile management in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Input data from API requests, including user registration, login, profile update, and password change.",
  "sinks": "Validation of email, password, and other user data; potential exposure if errors reveal sensitive info.",
  "flows": "User input → Data validation via Pydantic schemas → Usage in authentication and user management logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns observed. No insecure handling or unusual code flows.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines Pydantic models for user-related data with validation constraints. No data is processed, stored, or transmitted directly within this code; it only specifies data structures. The use of constr for password length constraints and email validation with EmailStr are standard practices. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected, and no external calls or unsafe code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a straightforward data schema definition for user-related operations, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard and safe.",
