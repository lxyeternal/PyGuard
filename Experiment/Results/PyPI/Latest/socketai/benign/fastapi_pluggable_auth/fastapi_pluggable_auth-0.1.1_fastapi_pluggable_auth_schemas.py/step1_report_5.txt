{
  "purpose": "Defines Pydantic data models for user authentication and profile management in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "User input fields such as email, password, code, display_name, old_password, new_password.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no direct data leakage, no external data transmission, and no dangerous data handling observed.",
  "flows": "User inputs (email, password, code, display_name, old_password, new_password) are validated but not further processed or transmitted in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic; use of standard validation libraries and common patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data schemas for user-related operations using Pydantic. Password constraints are enforced via 'constr'. No external calls, no code execution, or data handling beyond validation. No suspicious or malicious behavior identified. The code is straightforward, focusing on data validation with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious set of data models for user authentication and profile updates. No malicious activity or security issues are present.",
