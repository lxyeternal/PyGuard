  "purpose": "Define Pydantic schemas for user management, authentication, and profile updates in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Input fields from request payloads: email, password, code, display_name, old_password, new_password.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; code mainly defines data models without performing operations or data handling.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into schema validation models, with no processing that exposes or leaks data or executes untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward schema definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Pydantic models for user creation, login, profile update, and password change, all using standard types and validation rules. There are no dynamic executions, insecure handling, or suspicious behaviors. No external data sources, sinks, or flows indicate malicious intent. The use of UUIDs and email validation aligns with common best practices. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of schema definitions for user-related data in a FastAPI application. It appears to be safe and free from malicious or suspicious behavior.",
