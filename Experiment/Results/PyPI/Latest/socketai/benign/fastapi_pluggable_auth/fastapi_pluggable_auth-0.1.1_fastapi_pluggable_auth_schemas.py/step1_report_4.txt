  "purpose": "Defines data schemas for user authentication, profile, and token management in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Input data from API requests such as user registration, login, profile update, and password change.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data handling such as passwords, emails, and tokens.",
  "flows": "User input (email, password, code, display_name) flows into server-side validation and processing, including credential verification and profile updates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements. Use of pydantic for validation appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of pydantic models used for validation of user data in a FastAPI app. Password constraints are set with minimum and maximum lengths. Email and optional display names are validated properly. No direct use of environment variables, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no suspicious logic are present. The schemas are straightforward data containers for user management workflows. The structure and content appear typical for an auth module, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides standard data validation schemas for user-related operations with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It appears to be a benign, well-structured part of an authentication system.",
