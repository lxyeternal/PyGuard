{
  "purpose": "Define data schemas for user authentication, profile management, and token handling in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Constant _PWD for password constraints, field definitions in each Pydantic model (email, password, tokens, etc.).",
  "sinks": "None directly; data validation occurs but no data is sent or received from untrusted sources within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data entered via API endpoints validated against these schemas; no data flows or external interactions shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns; schemas are straightforward and intended for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines Pydantic models for user-related data validation, including email, password, tokens, and profile updates. The password constraints are reasonable. No external data sources or sinks are invoked here. No suspicious or malicious code segments, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is simple, clean, and focused solely on data validation schemas.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard schema definitions for user data validation with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
