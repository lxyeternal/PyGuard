  "purpose": "Define data validation schemas for user management and authentication in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Input data from API requests (email, password, tokens, profile info, old/new passwords, optional code).",
  "sinks": "None; the code only validates data without processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the schemas for validation; no further data processing or external calls are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward schema definitions with standard validation constraints.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Pydantic models for user creation, login, profile update, password change, and token handling. It employs standard validation (EmailStr, constr for password length). No dynamic code execution, external calls, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The schemas serve as data containers, with no operational logic or security-sensitive code. The absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or external dependencies indicates a benign and standard implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard, benign Pydantic schemas for user data validation in a FastAPI app. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis. The overall security posture of this code snippet is very low risk and safe for use.",
