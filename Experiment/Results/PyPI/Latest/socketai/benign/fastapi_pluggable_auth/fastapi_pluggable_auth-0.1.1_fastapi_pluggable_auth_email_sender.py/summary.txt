  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation for asynchronous email sending with templated content. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. Minor concerns about input sanitization are outside the scope of this snippet. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and does not warrant higher risk or malware scores."
