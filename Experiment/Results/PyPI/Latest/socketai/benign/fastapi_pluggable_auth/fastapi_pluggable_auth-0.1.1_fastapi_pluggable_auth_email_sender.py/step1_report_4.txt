  "purpose": "Send templated emails asynchronously using SMTP with configuration settings.",
  "sources": "Reading email template files from the filesystem, accessing configuration settings for email credentials and SMTP server details.",
  "sinks": "Sending email data over the network using aiosmtplib; rendering email content from templates which may contain untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Template rendering (source) flows into email message content (sink); email credentials and SMTP server details (sources) are used in network communication (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; template rendering is standard; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads email templates from a specific directory, rendering them with provided context. It constructs an email message, setting sender, recipient, subject, and body. It then asynchronously sends the email through SMTP using credentials and server info from a configuration object. No untrusted input flows into insecure functions outside the expected pattern. Sensitive data such as credentials are retrieved from a configuration module, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for sending templated emails asynchronously. It uses external libraries appropriately and securely retrieves configuration data. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this module.",
