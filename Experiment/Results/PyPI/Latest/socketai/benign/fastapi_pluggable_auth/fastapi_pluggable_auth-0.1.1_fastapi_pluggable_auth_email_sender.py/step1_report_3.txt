{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to send an email asynchronously using SMTP with templated email content generated via Jinja2.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters (to, subject, template_name, and context) and from the settings module for SMTP credentials and email sender address.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data (like 'to', 'subject', and 'template_name') is used in email headers and template rendering. SMTP credentials are used for sending email.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and context are used to render the email body; the email message is constructed and sent via aiosmtplib with SMTP credentials.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials are present; no suspicious dynamic code execution; no obfuscated code or hidden backdoors identified. Use of external libraries appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for email handling and asynchronous SMTP. It loads email templates from a local directory and renders them with user-provided context, which is a common practice. SMTP credentials are sourced from a settings module, not hardcoded, reducing risk. The code performs standard email sending procedures without any suspicious or malicious operations. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of an asynchronous email sender using templated content. No malicious behavior or security issues are apparent based on the provided code. It appears safe and functional.",
