{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to send an email asynchronously using SMTP with templated content rendered via Jinja2.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from function parameters (to, subject, template_name, **ctx) and configuration settings (settings object).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted input is included in email content or headers; SMTP credentials are used in network transmission.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (to, subject, template_name, **ctx) flow into email content rendering; SMTP credentials flow into email sending via aiosmtplib.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; use of environment variables for SMTP credentials is standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries for email construction and SMTP transmission. It loads templates from a local directory, renders email body dynamically, and sends email asynchronously. The SMTP credentials are sourced from a settings object, likely environment-configured. No evident malicious code, backdoors, or unusual data handling. No suspicious code injection or privacy violations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and intended for email automation. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated elements are present. Security risks are minimal if the settings object contains properly secured credentials.",
