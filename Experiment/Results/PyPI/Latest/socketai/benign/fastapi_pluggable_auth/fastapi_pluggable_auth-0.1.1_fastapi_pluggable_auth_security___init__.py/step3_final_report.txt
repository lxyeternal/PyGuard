{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing, environment variable handling, or system interaction without any evident malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, files, and possibly user input; no suspicious data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, network, or subprocesses, but no malicious or insecure use detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or files into processing functions; no untrusted data flow leading to malicious sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and functions, with clear data handling. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The security risk is minimal, and confidence in benign assessment is high. No anomalies or red flags are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or high security risk. The scores reflect a low threat level, consistent with the analysis.",
