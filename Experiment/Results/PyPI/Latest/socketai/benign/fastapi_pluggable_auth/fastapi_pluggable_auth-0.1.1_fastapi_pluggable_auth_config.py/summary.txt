  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code with a common security misconfiguration risk due to default secrets. Proper secret management is essential before deployment. No malware or obfuscation detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the main recommendation is to ensure secrets are securely set in production environments."
