  "purpose": "Configuration settings for FastAPI pluggable authentication, managing secrets, token expiration, email, SMTP, and rate limiting.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, hardcoded default values for secrets, tokens, email, and rate limits.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of secrets like 'jwt_secret', SMTP credentials, and environment variables which could be misused if compromised.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or defaults are read during instantiation of AuthSettings; secrets like 'jwt_secret' and SMTP credentials flow into application logic that relies on these configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets other than default placeholders; rate limits are hardcoded but benign; no backdoors or unusual behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a settings class for authentication configurations using pydantic's BaseSettings, allowing environment variable overrides. It includes sensitive fields such as 'jwt_secret', which is set to a placeholder string 'CHANGE_ME', indicating a need for proper secret management. SMTP credentials are defaulted to localhost and port 25, which are typical defaults but may be insecure if not overridden. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no dynamic code execution, no data exfiltration mechanisms, or network communications initiated by this code. Overall, it appears to be standard configuration code with placeholders, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class for an authentication system, containing default placeholders for secrets and credentials. There is no malicious behavior or malware present. The main security concern is the placeholder 'jwt_secret' which must be securely configured in production. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
