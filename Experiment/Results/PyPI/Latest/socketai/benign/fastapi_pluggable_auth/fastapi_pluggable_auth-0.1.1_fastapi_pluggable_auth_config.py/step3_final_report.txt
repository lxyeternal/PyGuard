  "purpose": "Configuration class for FastAPI authentication settings, including secrets, token expiration, email, SMTP, and rate limits.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via pydantic's BaseSettings, default values in class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential misconfiguration if defaults like 'CHANGE_ME' are not overridden, leading to insecure secrets.",
  "flows": "Environment variables override default attributes; insecure defaults may be used if not properly set.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder 'CHANGE_ME' for jwt_secret; no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration class with defaults, including insecure placeholders. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The main security concern is the default jwt_secret, which if not overridden, could lead to security issues. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk around 0.2-0.3 are appropriate, reflecting the misconfiguration risk but no active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code with a common security misconfiguration risk due to default secrets. Proper secret management is essential before deployment. No malware or obfuscation detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the main recommendation is to ensure secrets are securely set in production environments.",
