{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration settings for authentication, including secret keys, token expiration, email, SMTP, and rate limiting parameters for a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables via pydantic_settings from the environment file '.env' and default values assigned in code.",
  "targets": "Potential use of the jwt_secret, email_from, smtp_host, smtp_user, smtp_password, and rate_limits which could be misused if compromised, but no direct insecure sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or default values are loaded into settings; these are used by other parts of the application for authentication and email functions.",
  "anomalies": "The jwt_secret is set to a static placeholder 'CHANGE_ME', indicating insecure default credentials if not overridden; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets default configuration parameters for an authentication system using Pydantic BaseSettings. The jwt_secret has a placeholder value which should be overridden in production environments to prevent security issues. The environment variables are loaded from a '.env' file, which should be secured. The SMTP credentials are optional and default to localhost. No obfuscated code or malicious logic is present; the code is straightforward configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself does not contain malicious behavior but includes a security concern with a default JWT secret value ('CHANGE_ME') that must be replaced in production. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent; overall security risk is low if defaults are properly overridden.",
