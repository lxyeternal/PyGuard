  "purpose": "Configuration settings for authentication, including secrets, token expiry, email, SMTP, and rate limits, used in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Environment variable loading via pydantic_settings.BaseSettings and default attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input directly; configuration values are mostly static or environment-loaded.",
  "flows": "Configuration values may be loaded from environment variables into the AuthSettings instance, but no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The jwt_secret has a hardcoded default value 'CHANGE_ME', which is insecure for production; rate_limits dictionary is hardcoded but not unusual. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a settings class using pydantic for configuration management. It loads environment variables and provides defaults, including sensitive data like jwt_secret. The presence of a hardcoded secret indicates a security misconfiguration but not malicious intent. Other configurations such as token expiry, email, SMTP, and rate limits are typical. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The code structure is straightforward and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily handles configuration with some insecure defaults (hardcoded secrets), which should be replaced in production. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation. The security risk is low but warrants configuration review for secrets. No suspicious or malicious code detected.",
