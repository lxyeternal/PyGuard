  "purpose": "Configuration settings for authentication in a FastAPI application, including secret keys, token expiry, email settings, and rate limits.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via pydantic_settings BaseSettings, default attribute assignments",
  "sinks": "Usage of jwt_secret, smtp_password, and other configuration parameters that could influence authentication or email behavior",
  "flows": "Environment variables → AuthSettings instance → attributes used in auth processes; Potential untrusted data flows through env variables affecting jwt_secret and smtp_password",
  "anomalies": "jwt_secret defaults to 'CHANGE_ME', which indicates a placeholder; no hardcoded secrets other than the default; rate_limits stored as a dict inline, which is safe but unusual; no suspicious or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a settings class using pydantic's BaseSettings, allowing environment variables to override defaults. The jwt_secret default is 'CHANGE_ME', which is insecure but intended as a placeholder, not malicious. SMTP credentials are optional and default to localhost and port 25, typical for local testing. The code reads environment variables for sensitive data, which is a standard practice. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The inclusion of rate limits as a dictionary is benign. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward configuration module with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for a FastAPI authentication system. The only potential security concern is the default 'CHANGE_ME' value for jwt_secret, which should be overridden in production. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
