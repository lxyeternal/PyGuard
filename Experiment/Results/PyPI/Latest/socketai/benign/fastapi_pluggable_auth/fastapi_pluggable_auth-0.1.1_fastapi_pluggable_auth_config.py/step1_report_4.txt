{
  "purpose": "Define configuration settings for authentication, email, SMTP, and rate limiting in a FastAPI application using environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (via pydantic_settings, especially env_file='.env'), default values assigned directly in code.",
  "sinks": "Potential exposure of sensitive data such as 'jwt_secret', 'smtp_password' if environment variables are misconfigured or if the '.env' file is insecure.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or '.env' file set configuration values, which are then used throughout the application for authentication, email, and rate limiting functionalities.",
  "anomalies": "The 'jwt_secret' is hardcoded with a default value 'CHANGE_ME', which could be mistakenly used in production, leading to security risks. Other fields appear standard. No unusual code or behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic settings class for app configuration. It reads configuration from environment variables or defaults. The default 'jwt_secret' of 'CHANGE_ME' is a security concern if not overridden, as it indicates a placeholder. No other suspicious or malicious code is present. No hardcoded credentials other than the placeholder are visible. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code mainly sets configuration defaults, with a notable security risk due to the default 'jwt_secret' value, which should be overridden in production. Otherwise, no malicious behavior or malware is evident.",
