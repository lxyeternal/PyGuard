  "purpose": "This code manages authentication dependencies for a FastAPI application, validating JWT tokens and retrieving user data.",
  "sources": "Reads JWT token from HTTP Authorization header, decodes token, retrieves user from database using user ID in token payload.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if token decoding or user retrieval exposes sensitive info; raising HTTPException on validation failure.",
  "flows": "HTTP header input -> decode_token -> extract 'sub' -> User.get(id) -> return user or raise exception",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual code patterns; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution; exception handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly retrieves a JWT from the request header, decodes it, and fetches the user from the database. It handles errors appropriately by raising 401 errors on failure. Usage of external libraries appears standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; no data leaks or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard authentication dependency implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs JWT validation and user retrieval securely.",
