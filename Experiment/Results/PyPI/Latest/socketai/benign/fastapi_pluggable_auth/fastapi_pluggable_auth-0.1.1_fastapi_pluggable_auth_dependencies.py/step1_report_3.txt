{
  "purpose": "This code handles authentication by extracting a JWT token from HTTP headers, decoding it, and retrieving the corresponding user from the database.",
  "sources": "HTTP headers containing the 'Authorization' Bearer token, and the JWT decoding function 'decode_token'.",
  "sinks": "Database query to 'User.get' and the return of the User object; potentially any logging or error reporting that may occur elsewhere.",
  "flows": "HTTP header extraction -> decode_token function -> get user_id from payload -> database query for User -> return User object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code properly handles exceptions and input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard FastAPI dependencies for JWT-based authentication. It extracts the Bearer token from request headers, decodes it securely with 'decode_token', and retrieves user data from the database. Exception handling covers invalid tokens and missing users, raising a 401 Unauthorized error as expected. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or backdoors are evident. The logic appears straightforward and secure, following common best practices for JWT authentication.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard JWT authentication flow without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It properly handles invalid tokens and missing users, with no evidence of malicious intent or security flaws.",
