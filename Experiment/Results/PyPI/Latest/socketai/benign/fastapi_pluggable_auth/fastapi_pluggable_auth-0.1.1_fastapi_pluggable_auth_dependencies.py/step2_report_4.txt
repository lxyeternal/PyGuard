  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported observations against the code, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: Correctly describes the code as a standard JWT authentication dependency, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Accurate; the code is straightforward, using well-known libraries, with proper exception handling.\n- **Scores**:\n  - *malware*: 0 — aligns with no malicious behavior.\n  - *securityRisk*: 0.1 — low, given the code's simplicity and standard pattern.\n  - *obfuscated*: 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Justification**: The high confidence (0.95) is justified. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, confirms standard JWT authentication flow.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Consistent with the code's logic; no malicious signs.\n- **Scores**:\n  - *malware*: 0 — appropriate.\n  - *securityRisk*: 0.2 — slightly higher but still low, considering the code's simplicity.\n- **Justification**: Reasonable; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, describes a standard flow, no anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Scores**:\n  - *malware*: 0 — appropriate.\n  - *securityRisk*: 0.1 — justified.\n- **Justification**: No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Same as above, standard JWT dependency.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Accurate; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores**:\n  - *malware*: 0 — justified.\n  - *securityRisk*: 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Justification**: No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Describes the code as a typical JWT dependency, mentions the external `decode_token`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Correct; the code is standard, and no malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Scores**:\n  - *malware*: 0 — consistent.\n  - *securityRisk*: 0.2 — slightly higher but still low, considering the external dependency.\n- **Justification**: The only potential concern is the `decode_token` function, which is external and not shown. However, the report correctly notes this and does not assume maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of issues**: All reports correctly identify that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware scores**: All are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores**: All are 0, as expected.\n- **Security risk scores**: Range from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal risk, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and correctness.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- No modifications needed; the analysis aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 — low, considering the external `decode_token` function, but since it's external and not shown to be malicious, the risk remains minimal.\n\n**Summary**: The code appears secure, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minor risk score reflects the reliance on an external decoding function, which should be verified separately but does not currently raise suspicion.",
