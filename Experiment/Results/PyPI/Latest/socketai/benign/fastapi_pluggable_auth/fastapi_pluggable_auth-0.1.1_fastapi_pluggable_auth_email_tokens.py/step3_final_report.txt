{
  "purpose": "Provides JWT token generation and verification for user verification and password reset workflows, utilizing external configuration for secrets and algorithms.",
  "sources": "Reads user_id (UUID) input for token generation; reads token strings for verification.",
  "sinks": "Decodes tokens to extract 'sub' (user_id) after scope validation; raises exceptions on invalid tokens or scope mismatches.",
  "flows": "generate_* functions create tokens with user_id, scope, and expiration; verify_* functions decode tokens, validate scope, and return user_id.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard JWT practices with scope validation and expiration handling, sourcing secrets from external configuration. It performs straightforward token encoding and decoding, with proper exception handling. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The consistent use of external secrets and standard libraries indicates secure implementation. The scope validation ensures tokens are used appropriately. The code structure is clear, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of JWT token handling for verification and reset workflows. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
