{
  "purpose": "This code generates and verifies JWT tokens for user verification and password reset processes.",
  "sources": "Reads user_id input as UUID and settings for secret, algorithm, and token TTL; reads tokens for verification.",
  "sinks": "jwt.encode and jwt.decode functions handle tokens; no direct data leaks or external data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "User ID input -> token generation (payload creation) -> token encoding -> token verification -> payload decoding -> user ID extraction.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard JWT handling with expiration and scope claims; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures. No evident malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard practices for creating and validating JWT tokens, with scope control and expiration. It relies on external configuration for secrets and algorithms, which is good practice. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful actions are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical patterns for token management.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate JWT token handling for verification purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. The only potential concern is reliance on external settings, which should be securely managed, but this does not constitute malicious code.",
