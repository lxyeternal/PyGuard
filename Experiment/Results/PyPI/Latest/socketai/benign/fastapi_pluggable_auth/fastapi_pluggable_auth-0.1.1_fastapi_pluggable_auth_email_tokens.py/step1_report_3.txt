{
  "purpose": "The code generates and verifies JWT tokens for user email verification and password reset processes.",
  "sources": "Reads user_id (UUID) for token generation, reads tokens for verification, and imports configuration settings for secrets and algorithms.",
  "sinks": "jwt.encode() and jwt.decode() functions which handle token creation and validation, respectively.",
  "flows": "generate_verify_token and generate_reset_token create tokens from user_id and secret; verify_and_get_user_id and verify_reset_token decode tokens and validate scope, returning user_id.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets; use of standard JWT library. No unusual or suspicious code patterns. Proper scope validation is implemented. Environment variables and secrets are externalized via settings.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard JWT practices, with secrets and algorithms supplied via configuration. No suspicious or malicious code is evident. No data leaks, injections, or backdoors are present. The flow correctly handles token creation and validation. No obfuscation or unusual constructs detected. The code adheres to good security practices for token management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for token-based user verification and password reset functionality. No malicious behavior or security risks identified. Proper scope validation and external secret management suggest good security practices.",
