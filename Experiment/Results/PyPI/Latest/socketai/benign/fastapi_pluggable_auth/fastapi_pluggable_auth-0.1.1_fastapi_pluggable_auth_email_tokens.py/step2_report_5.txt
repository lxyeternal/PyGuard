  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, uses environment/configuration for secrets, and follows standard JWT practices.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code correctly handles scope validation, expiration, and secret management.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- The use of the 'jose' library is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code correctness:\n- The code generates JWT tokens with 'sub' (user_id), 'scope', and 'exp' claims.\n- It verifies tokens, checks scope, and extracts user_id.\n- The logic aligns with best practices.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of JWT token handling.\n\n---\n\n### Review of scores:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign 0, citing no malicious behavior.\n- This aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Verdict:** 0 is appropriate.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0, citing no obfuscation.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- **Verdict:** 0 is appropriate.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- Reports assign 0.1 or 0.2, citing minimal risk due to reliance on external settings.\n- Given the code's simplicity and proper secret management, a low risk score is justified.\n- **Assessment:** 0.1–0.2 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any risk score > 0.5:\n- No such scores are assigned; all are below 0.5.\n- If any were higher, justification would require evidence of hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or vulnerabilities, which are absent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.15 (average of 0.1 and 0.2)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is secure, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The low risk score reflects the minimal security concern, primarily related to external secret management, which is good practice.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores are appropriate, and the code is trustworthy.",
