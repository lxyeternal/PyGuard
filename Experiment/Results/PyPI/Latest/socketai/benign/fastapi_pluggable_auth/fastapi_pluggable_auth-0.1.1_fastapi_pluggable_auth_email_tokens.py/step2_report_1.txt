  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, uses environment/configuration for secrets, and employs standard JWT practices.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- All reports agree on the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The code correctly validates token scope and expiration, and handles exceptions properly.\n- The 'malware' score is 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Specific points:**\n\n#### **Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code matches the description: it generates and verifies JWT tokens for verification and password reset, with scope validation.\n- No issues are present in the code logic or implementation.\n\n#### **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as standard, secure, and free of malicious behavior.\n- No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n#### **Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- The 'malware' score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- The 'securityRisk' scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk, which aligns with the code's straightforwardness.\n- The 'obfuscated' score is 0, consistent with the code being clear and un-obfuscated.\n\n#### **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- No issues warrant a higher risk score; the code is standard, uses external secrets, and follows best practices.\n- The highest risk score is 0.2, which seems reasonable.\n\n#### **Malware score considerations:**\n- No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n- The code only performs cryptographic operations using a well-known library.\n- No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n\n#### **Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All claims are based on the code's content, which is transparent and standard.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are made about malicious intent.\n\n#### **Score consistency:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, obfuscation, and minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1-0.2** (low, due to external secret management and standard practices)\n\n**Overall, the code appears secure, standard, and trustworthy.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                                                                     |\n|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                       | No malicious activity or payloads present.                                                       |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                       | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.                              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1 - 0.2               | Low risk; relies on external secrets, follows best practices, no vulnerabilities observed.    |\n\n**This analysis confirms that the code is secure, well-implemented, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.**",
