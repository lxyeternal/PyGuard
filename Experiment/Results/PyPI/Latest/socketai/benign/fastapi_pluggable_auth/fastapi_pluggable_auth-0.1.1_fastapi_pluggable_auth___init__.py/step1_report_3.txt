{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and includes authentication-related routers into a FastAPI application, allowing for pluggable authentication modules and optional runtime configuration overrides.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration via imported `settings`, function parameters `app` and `settings_override`, and imported routers.",
  "sinks": "Calls `app.include_router()` to register routers; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User-provided `settings_override` can modify global `_settings`; routers are included into `app` via `include_router()`.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up application routers and allows optional runtime override of settings. It imports configuration objects and routers, then provides a function to include these routers into a FastAPI app. The use of a global variable `_settings` that can be overridden at runtime is notable but not inherently malicious. There are no indicators of data leakage, malicious network activity, or malicious code execution. The code structure appears standard for FastAPI modular setup. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard FastAPI setup module for including routers with optional settings override. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
