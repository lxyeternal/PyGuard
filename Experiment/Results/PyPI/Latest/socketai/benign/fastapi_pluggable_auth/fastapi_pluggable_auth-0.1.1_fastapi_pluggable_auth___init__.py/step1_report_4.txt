  "purpose": "Initialize and include authentication-related routers into a FastAPI application, with optional runtime override of settings.",
  "sources": "Import statements, function parameters, global variable assignment, router inclusion in app.",
  "sinks": "Global variable assignment (_settings), inclusion of routers into the FastAPI app.",
  "flows": "Import dependencies → Optional override of _settings → Loop through routers and include in app.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The code performs standard setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a function to include routers into a FastAPI app. It allows optional override of a global settings object, which is common in configuration management. No data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscated logic are present. The use of global variables for settings is typical but could pose issues in complex environments, yet this is not malicious. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are directly handled here. The code appears to be a standard, benign initialization module for an authentication plugin.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for plugging in routers into a FastAPI application. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor concern is the use of a global variable for settings, which is common and not inherently dangerous, but should be used carefully. Overall, there are no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
