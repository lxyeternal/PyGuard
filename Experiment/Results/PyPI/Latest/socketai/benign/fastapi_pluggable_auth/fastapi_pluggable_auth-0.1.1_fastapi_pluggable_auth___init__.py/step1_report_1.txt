  "purpose": "Initialize and include various authentication-related routers into a FastAPI application, with optional settings override.",
  "sources": "Import statements, function parameters, and global variables.",
  "sinks": "app.include_router() method, which registers routers with the FastAPI app.",
  "flows": "Global settings may be overridden, then multiple routers are registered to the app.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports or unusual control flow. The code is straightforward, mainly setup and registration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports FastAPI and local configuration modules, defines a function to include multiple routers into a FastAPI app, and allows optional runtime override of settings. There are no inputs from external sources beyond the function parameters, and no data processing or network activity occurs here. The code serves a standard initialization purpose with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of global variables for settings is common and not suspicious in this context. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a FastAPI application, registering routers with optional configuration override. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks present.",
