  "purpose": "Password hashing and verification using passlib's CryptContext with bcrypt.",
  "sources": "Input: password string to hash or verify; Data flow: from input to passlib's hash and verify functions.",
  "sinks": "Return of hashed password or boolean verification result; no external data sinks or leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input password -> hash_password() -> passlib hash function -> output hashed password; Input password + hashed password -> verify_password() -> passlib verify function -> boolean result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic practices with passlib and bcrypt, with straightforward functions for hashing and verification. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The data flow is typical for password handling modules, with no external data leaks or dangerous operations. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of password hashing and verification. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (0 or 0.1). The code can be considered safe and trustworthy.",
