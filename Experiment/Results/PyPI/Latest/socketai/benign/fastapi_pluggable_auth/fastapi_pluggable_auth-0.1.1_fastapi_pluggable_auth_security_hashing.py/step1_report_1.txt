{
  "purpose": "This module provides password hashing and verification functions using the passlib library to securely handle user passwords.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input parameter 'password' for hashing and verification functions.",
  "sinks": "The hashed password string returned by hash_password; verification result boolean from verify_password.",
  "flows": "Input password → hash_password → passlib CryptContext hash method → output hashed password; Input password and hash → verify_password → passlib verify method → output boolean.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. The code uses standard passlib practices for password security.",
  "analysis": "The code imports passlib's CryptContext to handle password hashing with bcrypt scheme. It defines two functions: one for hashing passwords and one for verifying passwords against stored hashes. The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, no external data sources, and no suspicious dynamic execution. It adheres to best practices for password security. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The implementation is minimal, clean, and typical for password handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely handles password hashing and verification using established libraries without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation for password security.",
