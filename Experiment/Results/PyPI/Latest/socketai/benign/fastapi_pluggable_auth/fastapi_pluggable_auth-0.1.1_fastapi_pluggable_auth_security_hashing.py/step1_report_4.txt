  "purpose": "This module provides functions for hashing and verifying passwords using the passlib library with bcrypt.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'password' and 'hashed' in hash_password and verify_password functions.",
  "sinks": "The hash_password function outputs hashed passwords; verify_password compares input password with stored hash.",
  "flows": "Password input -> hash_password -> output hash; stored hash + input password -> verify_password -> boolean.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code structures, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code employs passlib's CryptContext with bcrypt scheme to hash and verify passwords, following standard security practices. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The functions are straightforward wrappers around passlib functionality, with no external data sources, no secret leaks, and no obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard password hashing utility using well-established libraries. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
