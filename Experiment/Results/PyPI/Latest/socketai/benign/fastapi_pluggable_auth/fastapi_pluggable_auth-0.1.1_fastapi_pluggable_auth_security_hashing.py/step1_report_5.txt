  "purpose": "Provides password hashing and verification functions using passlib's CryptContext for secure password management.",
  "sources": "Input data: 'password' parameter for hashing and verification functions.",
  "sinks": "Hashing function output, verification result.",
  "flows": "Input password -> hash_password() -> hashed password; Input password + hashed password -> verify_password() -> boolean result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code, no unusual or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports passlib's CryptContext to manage password hashing with bcrypt scheme, which is a standard secure practice. The functions are straightforward, performing password hashing and verification without any external data leaks, network operations, or suspicious code. There are no hardcoded secrets, environment variable issues, or malicious behaviors. The structure is clear and typical for security-related utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement secure password hashing and verification using established libraries without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, well-structured implementation for password management.",
