  "purpose": "Provides password hashing and verification functions using passlib's CryptContext with bcrypt scheme.",
  "sources": "Input password string for hashing and verification functions.",
  "sinks": "Hashes and verification results; no external data or untrusted sinks are used.",
  "flows": "Input password → hash_password/verify_password → output hash/boolean; no external or untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports CryptContext for password hashing, initializes it with bcrypt scheme, and defines two functions for hashing and verifying passwords. These are standard practices for secure password management. No external data sources or untrusted data flows are involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The code adheres to common security guidelines for password handling.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward implementation of password hashing and verification using passlib, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
