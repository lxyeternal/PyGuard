{
  "purpose": "This module provides password hashing and verification functions using the passlib library, likely for user authentication security.",
  "sources": "The functions accept input parameters: 'password' and 'hashed' (both strings).",
  "sinks": "The hash_password function generates a hash from the password; verify_password compares a password with a hash to verify correctness.",
  "flows": "Input 'password' flows into 'pwd_context.hash' for hashing; input 'password' and 'hashed' flow into 'pwd_context.verify' for comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors observed. Usage of a standard library (passlib) for cryptographic functions is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'CryptContext' from passlib, sets up a context with bcrypt scheme, and provides two straightforward functions for password hashing and verification. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious data flows. The code appears to be a standard implementation for password security. It does not include any obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The library used is reputable for cryptographic functions, reducing the likelihood of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of password hashing and verification using passlib. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code snippet.",
