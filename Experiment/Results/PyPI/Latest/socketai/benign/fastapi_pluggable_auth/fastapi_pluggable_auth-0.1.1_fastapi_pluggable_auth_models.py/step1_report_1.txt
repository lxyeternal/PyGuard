  "purpose": "Define data models for User and RefreshToken entities in a FastAPI application using Tortoise ORM.",
  "sources": "Import statements for datetime, uuid, and Tortoise ORM fields; class attribute definitions; create_for class method.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to or reads from untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or external systems. The create_for method generates a UUID and sets expiration times internally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The use of datetime.now() for UTC time is acceptable, though datetime.utcnow() could be clearer.",
  "analysis": "The code defines ORM models with standard fields and a class method for creating refresh tokens. No code injection, malicious logic, or security flaws are evident. All inputs (user_id, token, ttl) are parameters, and their handling appears safe. The method correctly sets expiration times. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward ORM model definition for user authentication, with a method to create refresh tokens. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
