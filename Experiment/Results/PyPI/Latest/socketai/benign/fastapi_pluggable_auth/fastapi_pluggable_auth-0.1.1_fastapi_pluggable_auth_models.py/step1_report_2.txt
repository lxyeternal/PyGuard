  "purpose": "Define database models for user authentication and token management in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Imports from uuid, datetime, tortoise models; class attributes for User and RefreshToken; method create_for in RefreshToken.",
  "sinks": "Database interactions via ORM create method, UUID generation, and datetime operations.",
  "flows": "create_for method generates a new UUID, calculates expiration time, and creates a refresh token record associated with a user.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code uses standard libraries and ORM for data handling without hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard ORM models for users and refresh tokens, including fields for security-related data such as hashed passwords, tokens, and expiry times. The create_for method properly generates UUIDs and expiration timestamps using timezone-aware datetime. No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. No data leaks, external network interactions, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, secure implementation of user and token models with a method to create refresh tokens. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
