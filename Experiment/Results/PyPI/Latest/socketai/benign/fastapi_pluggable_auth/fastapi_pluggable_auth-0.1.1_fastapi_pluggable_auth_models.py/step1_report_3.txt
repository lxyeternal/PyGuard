{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for User and RefreshToken in a FastAPI application using Tortoise ORM.",
  "sources": "Reads include UUID generation, datetime for token expiration, and data model fields for user info and tokens.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable to data leakage if database access is compromised; no direct sinks for untrusted input present.",
  "flows": "User data and token information flow from model creation and database operations; token creation flows from create_for method.",
  "anomalies": "Uses datetime.now(timezone.utc) for token expiry, which is acceptable; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed; no obfuscated code or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines ORM models for user and refresh token management, including fields for sensitive data such as hashed passwords and tokens. The create_for class method securely generates a UUID for the token jti and sets expiration using timezone-aware datetime. No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious logic are present. The overall structure follows standard practices without signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of user and token models with no malicious behavior detected. It does not include any suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
