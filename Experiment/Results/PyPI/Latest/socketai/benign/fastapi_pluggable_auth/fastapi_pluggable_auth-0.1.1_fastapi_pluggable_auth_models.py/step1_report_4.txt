  "purpose": "Define data models for User and RefreshToken entities in a FastAPI application using Tortoise ORM.",
  "sources": "None; all data fields are model definitions and class methods that handle internal data.",
  "sinks": "The create_for class method writes data to the database; it does not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no external data flows are evident; class methods perform database operations internally.",
  "anomalies": "The method create_for uses datetime.now() for setting expiration, which may be less precise or inconsistent in timezone handling compared to datetime.utcnow(). No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present. The models are standard ORM definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two models, User and RefreshToken, with standard fields including UUIDs, strings, booleans, and datetime fields. The create_for method in RefreshToken generates a new token record, assigning an expiration time with datetime.now(). While this is generally acceptable, using datetime.now() could be less ideal than datetime.utcnow() for timezone consistency. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are detected. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard ORM model definitions for user authentication entities with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The only minor concern is the use of datetime.now() instead of datetime.utcnow(), which could lead to timezone inconsistencies, but this does not constitute malicious behavior.",
