  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is straightforward ORM models for User and RefreshToken, with no malicious intent, no suspicious code, or external data leaks. It notes the use of `datetime.now()` for UTC time, which is acceptable but could be clearer.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code does not contain any signs of malware, obfuscation, or security flaws. The logic appears correct, and no external inputs are mishandled.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard ORM models, safe handling of UUIDs, tokens, and timestamps. No suspicious activity or external data leaks.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code or vulnerabilities detected. The code is standard and secure.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard ORM models. Mentions that the `create_for` method uses `datetime.now()` for expiration, which is acceptable but could be improved with `datetime.utcnow()` for consistency.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the timezone handling, not security-related.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — seems a bit high given the lack of actual vulnerabilities, but the note about `datetime.now()` is more about best practices than security.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on standard patterns. Highlights the use of `datetime.now()` for expiration, which could be less ideal but not malicious.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malware or malicious intent. The models are typical.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms standard ORM models, with no suspicious code or external data leaks. Notes the use of `datetime.now()` but considers it acceptable.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is a standard implementation of user and token models using Tortoise ORM. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present.\n\n- **Use of `datetime.now()`:** While it's generally better to use `datetime.utcnow()` for timezone consistency, this is a best-practice concern, not a security flaw.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the absence of actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent, the risk scores should be very low, close to 0, perhaps up to 0.1 for the minor concern about `datetime.now()`.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minor best-practice concern, not a security risk.\n\n**Overall, the reports are consistent with the code.** The only adjustment I would suggest is lowering the risk scores slightly, reflecting that these are standard ORM models with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThe code appears secure, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The minor concern about `datetime.now()` does not constitute a security risk but is worth noting for best practices.",
