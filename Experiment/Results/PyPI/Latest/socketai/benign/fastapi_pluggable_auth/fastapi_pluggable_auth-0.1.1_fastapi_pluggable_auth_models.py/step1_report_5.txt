  "purpose": "Defines database models for User and RefreshToken entities in a FastAPI application, managing user data and refresh token lifecycle.",
  "sources": "Imports from datetime, uuid, and tortoise ORM modules; class methods and model field definitions.",
  "sinks": "Method 'create_for' generates UUIDs and sets expiration times; no external or untrusted data handling beyond internal UUID generation.",
  "flows": "UUIDs are generated internally; token creation involves no external input directly affecting critical data. The create_for method creates refresh tokens with expiration timestamps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Usage of standard libraries and ORM models appears typical. No unusual or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines ORM models with standard field types and a class method for creating refresh tokens with an expiration time. UUIDs are generated internally; timestamps are set using datetime with timezone. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to follow common patterns for user management and token handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe with no malicious behavior detected. It performs standard user and token management functions using established libraries. No security risks identified within this module.",
