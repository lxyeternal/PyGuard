  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, external files, network connections, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded strings, embedded credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, system commands, environment variables, external storage.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (inputs, environment) to sinks (network, files, commands) often via obfuscated or dynamic code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation techniques, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, inconsistent indentation, lack of comments.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. Suspicious patterns include eval usage, hardcoded credentials, and obfuscated variable names. No explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, but the high suspicion warrants cautious scoring. Benign code shows no obfuscation or suspicious activity. Scores are generally aligned with the described patterns, with some room for slight adjustments to better reflect suspicion levels.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates moderate to high suspicion of malicious intent based on obfuscation and dynamic execution indicators. While no explicit payloads are confirmed, the patterns observed justify elevated malware and obfuscation scores. Slight score increases for reports with high obfuscation and suspicious patterns are recommended to better align with the observed traits. Overall, the assessments are consistent and appropriately cautious, emphasizing the need for further static or dynamic analysis before deployment.",
