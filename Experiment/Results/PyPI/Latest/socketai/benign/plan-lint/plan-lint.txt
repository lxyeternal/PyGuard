      "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured CLI tool with minimal security risks primarily related to trust in dynamically loaded modules. No malware or obfuscation detected. The risk score appropriately reflects the potential for exploitation via untrusted rule modules, but no active malicious behavior is present."

The pattern matching is straightforward, and the code's purpose is clear. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score is appropriately low at 0.1–0.2, reflecting the code's benign and static nature."

Report 4 displays significant suspicious patterns, justifying an increase in malware score from 0.4 to 0.7 and risk score from 0.6 to 0.7. The obfuscation score remains justified at 0.8. Adjusting these scores better reflects the potential threat level based on the described behaviors."

The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The security risk score is low (around 0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the potential for false positives but no active threat. All reports correctly assess the code as benign with scores consistent with its purpose. No adjustments are necessary."
