{
  "purpose": "This module provides validation functions for checking plans against policies, including tool allowance, bounds, secret detection, cycle detection, and risk scoring.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from plan steps' attributes such as step.args and step.id; regex patterns for secret detection are provided via policy parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily generates error and warning objects; there are no direct data leaks, network operations, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from plan step inputs through various validation functions, accumulating errors or warnings; no data is sent externally or stored insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic is present. Functions perform standard validation; cycle detection is naive but not malicious. No obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs plan validation tasks, including checking allowed tools, bounds, secrets via regex, and cycle detection based on step references. Risk scoring is based on errors and warnings. No network or system modification code, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. The cycle detection is simplistic but does not exhibit malicious intent. Regex patterns are user-supplied but are used safely. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code pathways are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard validation module with no malicious intent or harmful behavior. It performs expected validation functions without any suspicious operations or malware indicators.",
