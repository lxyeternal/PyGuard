  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential issues, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs standard validation tasks with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Malware score is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. Cycle detection is naive but not malicious. Regex patterns are user-supplied but used safely for validation.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0 is appropriate. Risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal concern, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard validation functions with no malicious behavior. Malware score is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, with no external network calls, system modifications, or backdoors. Cycle detection is naive but not malicious.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware remains 0, risk is low (0). The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard validation, no malicious intent, with a confidence of 0.95. Malware score is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis confirms no suspicious activity. Cycle detection is naive but not malicious. Regex is used for validation, not malicious pattern extraction.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk minimal. The high confidence supports this.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Validates plan steps, no malicious behavior, risk is 0, malware is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical validation module, with no network or system modifications. Cycle detection is naive but not malicious.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard validation, no malicious code, malware score 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** No dangerous operations, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns. Regex patterns are user-supplied but used safely.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware remains 0, risk is low, matching the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n\n- **Risk score:** Very low (around 0.1 to 0.2), consistent with the minimal security concern.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.1 - 0.2** |\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to naive cycle detection and user-supplied regex, but overall very low risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's actual behavior.",
