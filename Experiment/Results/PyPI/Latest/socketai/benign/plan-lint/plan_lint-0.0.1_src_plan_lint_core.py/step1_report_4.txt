{
  "purpose": "The code provides validation functions for plans against policies, including tool allowance checks, bounds validation, secret detection, cycle detection, and risk scoring.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include plan steps (plan.steps), step arguments (step.args), and regex patterns for secret detection (policy.deny_tokens_regex).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are error reporting via PlanError objects, especially when violations are detected, and regex matching results. No direct data exfiltration, network, or system modification code is present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from plan steps into validation functions; errors are generated based on data validation. No external network or system commands are executed.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code relies on standard Python features and libraries, with proper exception handling. The cycle detection is naive but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly validates plan steps against policies, including tool allowance, argument bounds, and secret patterns, with proper error handling. It performs cycle detection in a simple, naive manner without external dependencies. Risk scoring is based on error types. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. It is structured and clear, following standard patterns for validation logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate validation module for plan policies with no malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is designed for security and correctness, focusing on policy compliance and risk assessment. No indicators of supply chain or malware issues are present.",
