{
  "purpose": "This module provides validation functions for plan steps against policies, including tool allowances, bounds, secret detection, cycle detection, and risk scoring.",
  "sources": "Input data includes plan steps (plan.steps), step arguments (step.args), and policy parameters (allow_tools, bounds, deny_tokens_regex, risk_weights).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include regex pattern matching in check_raw_secrets, which inspects step arguments for secrets, and the detection of cycles via string searches in step args.",
  "flows": "Input plan data flows through validation functions: tool checks, bounds checks, secret pattern matching, cycle detection, and risk scoring.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are detected. The code's logic is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns or misleading variable use.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation tasks such as checking tool permissions, argument bounds, secret pattern matching, and cycle detection. regex is used for secret pattern matching but appears to be for validation, not malicious pattern extraction. Cycle detection is naive but does not pose malicious behavior. No external network communication, file access, or system manipulation is present. The functions handle data in a typical manner, and there are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or covert channels. The risk scoring and validation logic are standard and do not include malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward validation module intended to enforce policy compliance on plan steps. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It performs expected validation functions without suspicious behavior. Overall, it is a benign, well-structured security check code.",
