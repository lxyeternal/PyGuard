{
  "purpose": "The core module for plan-linter, providing functions to validate plans against policies, including checks for tool allowance, argument bounds, secrets, cycles, and risk scoring.",
  "sources": "Reading input from 'plan' object, 'policy' object, step arguments, plan steps, and regex patterns for secrets.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable code if untrusted data is used in regex patterns or processed in validation functions, but no direct sinks for data leakage or malicious activity are present. No external network calls or system modifications are found.",
  "flows": "Data flows from plan steps and their arguments through validation functions (tool checks, bounds checks, secret detection) to errors and warnings. No external or system flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code mainly performs standard validation logic. The cycle detection is naive but does not contain malicious behavior. No obfuscation or hidden code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard plan validation, including checks for allowed tools, argument bounds, secrets via regex patterns, and cycle detection. The cycle detection is simplistic and does not perform complex graph analysis but does not pose malicious risk. The regex-based secret detection is standard and intended for privacy/security, not malicious activity. No external network or system modifications are performed. The overall logic is straightforward, with no suspicious behaviors or malicious intent identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical plan validation module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected validation tasks securely and transparently. No evidence of malware or malicious code is detected.",
