{
  "purpose": "The module provides functions to validate plans against policies, including checking tool allowance, bounds, secrets, cycle detection, and risk scoring.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from plan steps, including step arguments, step IDs, and plan structure. It also reads regex patterns for secret detection.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include regex pattern matching (which could be exploited if patterns are maliciously crafted), but no network, file, or system command execution occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from plan steps into validation functions; errors and warnings are generated based on checks. No external or untrusted data output occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns are evident. The regex patterns are user-supplied but are used safely for pattern matching within strings.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation routines on a plan data structure: checking tool permissions, argument bounds, secret patterns, cycle detection, and risk scoring. No network or file operations are present. No use of dangerous eval, exec, or system commands. The cycle detection is naive but not malicious. Pattern matching for secrets is standard, with regex compiled internally. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard validation module for plan policies with no malicious or maliciously-intended code detected. It relies on pattern matching and simple graph checks without harmful behaviors. Overall security risk is minimal.",
