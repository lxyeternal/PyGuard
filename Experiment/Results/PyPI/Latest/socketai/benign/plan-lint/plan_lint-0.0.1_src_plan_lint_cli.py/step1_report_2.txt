{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for plan-linter, which validates plans against policies and schemas, and reports results.",
  "sources": "User-provided plan file, policy file, schema file, output file, command-line arguments, environment variables, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Output streams (stdout or file), logging or warning messages, module imports, and exceptions handling.",
  "flows": "Input data from plan file, policy file, and CLI arguments flow into validation functions, rule checks, and reporting functions; output is written to specified output streams.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. Usage of standard importlib and os modules appears typical. No obfuscated code features identified.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and project-specific modules to perform validation tasks. It loads rules dynamically from a directory, handles exceptions gracefully, and outputs reports accordingly. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code does perform file operations and dynamic module imports, but these are standard for CLI tools. No embedded or hidden malicious behavior is evident. The code includes typical patterns for CLI apps and plugin loading, with proper error handling. There are no indications of malicious intent or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI tool for plan validation with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs expected functions using common patterns without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
