  "purpose": "CLI tool for validating plans against policies and schemas, with dynamic rule module loading.",
  "sources": "File inputs (plan, policy, schema), dynamic import of rule modules from 'rules' directory.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of untrusted rule modules during import, report output (stdout or file).",
  "flows": "Load plan -> load policy -> dynamically import rules -> validate plan -> aggregate errors -> calculate risk -> generate report.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import of modules from 'rules' directory without sandboxing or validation; no input validation on file contents.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard CLI operations with dynamic plugin loading. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The primary security concern is the potential execution of malicious modules if untrusted code is placed in 'rules'. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior, reflecting low but present supply chain risk. Exception handling and resource management are appropriate. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured CLI tool with minimal security risks primarily related to trust in dynamically loaded modules. No malware or obfuscation detected. The risk score appropriately reflects the potential for exploitation via untrusted rule modules, but no active malicious behavior is present.",
