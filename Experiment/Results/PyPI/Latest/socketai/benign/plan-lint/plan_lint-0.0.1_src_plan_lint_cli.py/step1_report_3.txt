  "purpose": "CLI tool for static analysis of LLM agent plans, validating plans against policies and schemas.",
  "sources": "Reads plan files, policy files, schema files, and rule modules from the filesystem; loads modules dynamically.",
  "sinks": "Outputs results to stdout or files; prints warnings and errors to console; calls sys.exit(1) to indicate failure.",
  "flows": "Reads plan, policy, schema -> loads rule modules -> runs validation rules -> calculates risk score -> outputs report -> exits with code based on result.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic module loading with importlib, which could be exploited if malicious modules are present. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or hidden backdoors detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a CLI wrapper for plan validation, loading rules dynamically and handling input/output files. The dynamic import of rule modules from a directory could be exploited if untrusted modules are present, but the code itself does not contain malicious logic. The use of sys.exit and console printing are standard. No signs of malware such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward, legitimate CLI tool with potential risk only if malicious rule modules are added externally.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI application for plan validation, with no inherent malicious behavior. The primary security concern is the dynamic import of rule modules, which could be exploited if untrusted code is placed in the rules directory. No malware or malicious intent is evident from this code alone.",
