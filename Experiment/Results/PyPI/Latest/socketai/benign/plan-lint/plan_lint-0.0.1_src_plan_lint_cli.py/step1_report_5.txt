  "purpose": "Command-line interface for the plan-linter tool, providing plan validation, rule loading, and report generation.",
  "sources": "User input for plan_file, policy_file, schema_file, output_format, output_file, and fail_risk; reading files from filesystem (plan, policy, rules).",
  "sinks": "Reading plan, policy, and rules files; writing output to stdout or specified output file; exit codes indicating success or failure.",
  "flows": "Input files are loaded at start, rules are dynamically imported, validation results are processed, and reports are generated based on user options. Exit codes depend on validation outcome.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors detected. Use of dynamic importlib imports is standard for plugin systems. Error handling is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical CLI wrapper for a static analysis tool. It loads modules and data, applies rules, computes risk scores, and outputs results. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are present. The dynamic import of rule modules is standard for extensibility. The use of file I/O and sys.exit() for process control is typical for CLI tools. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI for a plan validation tool with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily performs file I/O, dynamic module loading, and report generation, all of which are typical for such tools.",
