{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for the plan-linter tool, enabling validation of plans against policies and schemas.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments; file paths for plan, policy, and schema files; import statements for modules; dynamic module loading in load_rules function.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations for plan, policy, schema, and rule modules; output to stdout or specified output file; potential error messages printed to console.",
  "flows": "User provides file paths -> load_plan/load_policy load data from files -> load_rules dynamically imports rule modules -> rules check_plan functions analyze plan -> risk score calculated -> results formatted and output to console or file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No untrusted network connections or data exfiltration code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles loading modules, reading files, applying validation rules, and outputting results. No external network communication, code injection, or hidden malicious activity is evident. Dynamic imports are confined to local rule modules, which are expected to be safe. Exception handling is standard, with warnings for rule load failures. The script adheres to typical CLI design without suspicious behaviors. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward CLI for plan validation with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs plan validation tasks securely, with no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is well-structured, with standard practices for plugin loading and file handling. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or security exploits.",
