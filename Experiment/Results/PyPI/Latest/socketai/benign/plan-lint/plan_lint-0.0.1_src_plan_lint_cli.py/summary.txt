  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured CLI tool with minimal security risks primarily related to trust in dynamically loaded modules. No malware or obfuscation detected. The risk score appropriately reflects the potential for exploitation via untrusted rule modules, but no active malicious behavior is present."
