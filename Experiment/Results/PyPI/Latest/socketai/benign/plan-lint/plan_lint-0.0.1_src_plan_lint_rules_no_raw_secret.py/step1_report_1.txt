{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to detect raw secrets or sensitive information in plan steps by matching specific regex patterns against step arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads data from plan step arguments (step.args) as strings for pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "None directly; the code does not send data externally or write sensitive info to disk but reports errors when patterns match.",
  "flows": "Input data (step.args) is converted to string and matched against regex patterns; matching results trigger error reports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden code, or unusual code structures are present. The code performs pattern matching with predictable regexes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to check plan steps for raw secrets using regex patterns. It includes built-in patterns targeting API keys, tokens, JWTs, passwords, AWS keys, and user-defined deny tokens. It processes each step by converting arguments to strings and matches against these patterns, reporting errors if matches are found. No dynamic code execution, external network communication, or obfuscated logic is present. The logic is straightforward, and patterns are explicit. The code appears to serve a security auditing purpose for secret detection without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for detecting sensitive data in plan steps based on regex patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It performs expected pattern matching for secret detection with no harmful side effects.",
