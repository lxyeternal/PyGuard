  "purpose": "Detects raw secrets or sensitive information in plan steps by matching patterns against step arguments.",
  "sources": "step.args converted to string for pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data beyond pattern matching, nor does it transmit or store data.",
  "flows": "Input (step.args) -> regex patterns -> error reporting if matches found.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; uses broad regex patterns that could produce false positives but are not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static regex pattern matching on stringified step arguments to identify potential secrets. It checks user-defined patterns from policy and built-in regexes targeting common secret formats such as API keys, tokens, passwords, and AWS keys. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is straightforward, and the patterns are broad but standard for secret detection. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The code's purpose is purely static pattern matching, and it reports errors when matches are found. The regex patterns could generate false positives, but this is inherent to such detection methods and not a flaw. The code does not read or write external data beyond pattern matching, nor does it perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward secret detection utility based on regex pattern matching. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The security risk score is low (around 0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the potential for false positives but no active threat. All reports correctly assess the code as benign with scores consistent with its purpose. No adjustments are necessary.",
