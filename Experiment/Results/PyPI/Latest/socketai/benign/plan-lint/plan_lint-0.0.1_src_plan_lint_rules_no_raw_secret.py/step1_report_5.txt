{
  "purpose": "The code defines rules and functions to detect raw secrets or sensitive information within plan steps, primarily for security auditing.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'step.args' converted to string, and from patterns specified in 'policy.deny_tokens_regex' and built-in regex patterns.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the collection of 'PlanError' objects which log potential security issues when matches are found; these errors may be used for alerting or logging.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'step.args' flows through regex matching against both policy-defined patterns and built-in patterns; upon matches, errors are generated and accumulated.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies; it performs standard pattern matching for secret detection. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically checks plan steps for potential secrets by applying user-defined regex patterns and common secret patterns. It converts step arguments to string, searches for matches, and logs errors if patterns are found. The logic is straightforward and focused solely on secret detection, with no malicious or suspicious behavior evident. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. Overall, it appears to be a benign security auditing utility.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a security-focused pattern matching implementation for secret detection within plan steps. It operates transparently, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors. Its function is to identify and flag sensitive data patterns to prevent leaks or mishandling. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
