{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to detect raw secrets or sensitive information within plan steps by matching patterns in step arguments against defined and built-in regular expressions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the string representation of each plan step's arguments (step.args).",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks such as network connections or file writes; the code only generates error reports based on pattern matching.",
  "flows": "The flow involves converting step arguments to strings, applying regex patterns to detect sensitive data, and generating error objects if matches are found.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious anomalies are present. The code's pattern matching is straightforward, relying on regex without obfuscated or malicious code constructs. There are no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a security pattern detector focusing on identifying potential secrets like API keys, tokens, passwords, and AWS keys in plan steps. It uses both user-defined regex patterns from a policy and built-in regex patterns for common secrets. The patterns are applied sequentially, and errors are logged if matches are found. The code does not perform any unsafe operations, external communications, or obfuscation. The purpose appears to be secure and benign, intended to flag sensitive data before execution or sharing. No malicious behavior or malware indications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a static pattern-based scanner to identify raw secrets in plan steps. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It is a typical security tool component designed for privacy and security compliance checks. The risk level is very low, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
