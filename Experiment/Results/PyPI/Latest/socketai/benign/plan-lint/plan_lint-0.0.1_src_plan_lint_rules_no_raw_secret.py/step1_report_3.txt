{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to detect raw secrets or sensitive information in plan steps, likely for security auditing or compliance enforcement.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the 'step.args' converted to string, which contain command arguments or other textual data from plan steps.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the collection of PlanError objects generated when patterns indicative of secrets are detected. These errors could be used to raise alerts or logs.",
  "flows": "The code converts each step's arguments to string, applies regex patterns (both custom from policy and built-in patterns) to find potential secrets, and logs errors upon matches.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain anomalies; it appears straightforward, focusing on pattern matching for secret detection. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads plan step arguments and applies regex patterns to identify potential secrets, including API keys, tokens, JWTs, passwords, and AWS keys. It uses both custom patterns from a provided policy and built-in patterns. When a match occurs, it logs an error. The flow is simple: input -> pattern matching -> error logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code's function aligns with security scanning rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a security auditing tool for detecting sensitive information in plan steps. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It solely performs pattern-based secret detection, which is common in security workflows. The overall security risk is minimal, and no anomalies or obfuscation are present.",
