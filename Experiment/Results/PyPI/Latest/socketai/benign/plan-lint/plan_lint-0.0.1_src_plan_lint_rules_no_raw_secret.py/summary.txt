  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward secret detection utility based on regex pattern matching. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The security risk score is low (around 0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the potential for false positives but no active threat. All reports correctly assess the code as benign with scores consistent with its purpose. No adjustments are necessary."
