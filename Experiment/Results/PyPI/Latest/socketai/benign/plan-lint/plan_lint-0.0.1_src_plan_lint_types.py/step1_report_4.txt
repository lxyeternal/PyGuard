  "purpose": "Define data models and enumerations for plan validation and policy enforcement in a plan-linter.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input; it only defines data structures.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes data from untrusted sources; it is purely structural.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no runtime data handling is implemented.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of type definitions using Python's typing and Pydantic models to represent various aspects of plan validation, errors, warnings, policies, and results. It imports standard modules and third-party libraries but does not perform any data processing, I/O, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious logic, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a standard data schema used for validation and policy enforcement, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward set of data models for plan validation, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It does not process external data or perform actions that could be exploited maliciously. Overall, it is safe and clean.",
