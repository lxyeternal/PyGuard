{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for plan validation, including status, errors, warnings, steps, policies, and validation results.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data is defined through class attributes and default factory functions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted external data; data validation occurs within the model definitions.",
  "flows": "Data flows are model-based, with no execution of external commands or code injection pathways present.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard libraries and patterns; no suspicious code structures, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Pydantic models defining structured data for plan validation processes. It uses Enums for status and error codes, and default factory functions to initialize fields. No user input handling, command execution, network operations, or secret handling is present. The models seem purely descriptive, with no signs of malicious logic or backdoors. There are no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data models for plan validation, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be purely declarative and safe.",
