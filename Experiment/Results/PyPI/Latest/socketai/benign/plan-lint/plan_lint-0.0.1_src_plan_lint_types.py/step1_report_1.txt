  "purpose": "Define data models and enumerations for plan validation, including plans, errors, warnings, policies, and validation results.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input directly; it only defines data structures.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or handling is evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this is purely schema definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward data modeling with standard libraries and no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes schema models using pydantic, enum, and typing modules. It defines various enums for status and error codes, and data models for plan components, errors, warnings, policies, and validation results. There are no functions executing external commands, network operations, or handling untrusted input within this snippet. The design is purely declarative, serving as type definitions for validation processes. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code does not perform any data processing or system interaction; it only provides structured data schemas.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe set of data model definitions with no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger validation system, with no indications of supply chain threats or malware.",
