{
  "purpose": "Defines data models and enums for plan validation, errors, warnings, policies, and results in a structured schema.",
  "sources": "Input data into the models such as plan details, errors, warnings, policies, and validation results.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data fed into the models, but no direct sinks or external effects are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external sources into the models; no runtime or external processing occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, declarative, and uses standard libraries without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data schema definitions using Pydantic and Enums. It contains no executable logic, network activity, or secret handling. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The models accept external data but do not process it maliciously. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The potential for downstream misuse of untrusted data is outside the scope of this code, which is purely declarative.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of data models for plan validation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are justified and accurate.",
