{
  "purpose": "Define data models and enumerations for plan validation, including plans, steps, errors, warnings, and policies.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; data is represented via model classes. No direct data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points involving untrusted data; the code primarily defines data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to data validation and object instantiation; no external data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious patterns detected. Use of Enums and data classes appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type definitions and data models for plan validation, using standard libraries and well-defined classes. No code execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources is present. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, and no malicious logic are evident. The structure is typical for schema definitions and does not include suspicious or potentially malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of schema definitions for plan validation, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard in purpose and implementation.",
