{
  "purpose": "The code defines rules for denying SQL write operations within a plan, ensuring that potentially harmful or unauthorized write queries are prevented.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'step.tool' and 'step.args' fields within each plan step.",
  "sinks": "The code evaluates 'query' strings and 'step.tool' values to detect SQL write commands, potentially influencing control flow or error reporting.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'step.tool' and 'step.args' → checks for specific SQL tool names and query content → triggers errors if write operations are detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code only performs validation and error reporting based on string pattern matching; it does not execute or inject code, nor does it handle or manipulate external inputs beyond checking plan steps.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward in its logic: it inspects plan steps to identify SQL write operations by checking tool names, parameters, and query content for write keywords. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The primary purpose is validation against unsafe SQL operations, with no evidence of malicious intent or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple validation rule set to prevent SQL write operations, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as a static check. There are no anomalies or suspicious actions observed.",
