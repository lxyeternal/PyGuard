{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of rules to identify and deny SQL write operations within a plan of steps, mainly to prevent potentially harmful or unauthorized database modifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from step attributes such as 'tool', 'args', and 'query' to determine if a step involves SQL write operations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive information could be revealed if errors or logs contain details about the SQL queries or step attributes, but this is not explicitly shown in the code.",
  "flows": "The code inspects each plan step for SQL tools and query content; if a step indicates a write operation (e.g., contains 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', etc.), an error is generated. Data flows from step attributes to error generation based on pattern matching.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard; it uses string matching to detect write keywords. There are no unusual or suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No backdoors or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code's logic focuses on identifying SQL write operations by examining the 'tool' attribute for specific prefixes or values and analyzing 'query' strings for SQL write keywords. It performs straightforward string checks without executing any untrusted code or external calls. The error messages are clear and related to the SQL operations detected. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or covert channels. The code is well-structured, with no anomalies suggesting sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This source code functions as a security policy enforcement component to prevent SQL write operations in a plan. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, and its purpose is to enforce safety rules. The code appears clean, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
