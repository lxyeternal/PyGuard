  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, explicit security rule to prevent SQL write operations. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The pattern matching is straightforward, and the code's purpose is clear. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score is appropriately low at 0.1–0.2, reflecting the code's benign and static nature."
