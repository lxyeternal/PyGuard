  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual logic, potential issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code detects SQL write operations via tool names, flags, and query content. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's straightforward pattern matching. The low risk score seems appropriate given the code's benign nature. The malware score is correctly zero since there's no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on static pattern matching. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The minimal risk score is justified. No obfuscation or malware signs. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs simple validation checks, no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is justified. The malware score remains zero, aligning with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code checks for SQL write operations via string matching. No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is appropriate. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward validation module with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score matches the code's function. Malware score remains zero.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; malware=0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; 0 is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's benign pattern matching nature, low scores (0.1-0.2) are justified. There's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting the minimal security risk from pattern matching rules)\n\nThe code is a simple, explicit security rule enforcing no SQL write operations, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or hidden malicious intent. The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
