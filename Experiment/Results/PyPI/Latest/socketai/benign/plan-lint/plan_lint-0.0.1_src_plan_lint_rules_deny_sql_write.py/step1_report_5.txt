The code is straightforward, well-documented, and only performs validation logic.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code systematically checks plan steps for potential SQL write operations through three main methods: tool name checks, 'can_write' flag, and presence of SQL write keywords in queries. Each check aims to prevent malicious or unauthorized write actions by raising errors if any condition indicating a write is met. The logic appears standard and consistent with security best practices for input validation. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present. The code does not interact with external systems, handle sensitive data, or perform any suspicious activities.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a standard validation module designed to prevent SQL write operations within a plan. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It functions as a security control rather than a threat. The overall security risk is very low.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
