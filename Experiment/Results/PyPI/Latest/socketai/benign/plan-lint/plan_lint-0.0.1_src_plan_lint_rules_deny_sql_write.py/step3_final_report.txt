  "purpose": "This code enforces a rule to deny SQL write operations by checking plan steps for specific tool patterns, flags, and query content indicating write activity.",
  "sources": "step.tool attribute, step.args['can_write'], step.args['query']",
  "sinks": "Error reporting via PlanError when write operations are detected",
  "flows": "Source: tool name or query content; Sink: error generation upon detection of write activity",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward pattern matching and string checks; no obfuscation or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code performs explicit static pattern matching to detect SQL write operations through tool name prefixes, flags, and query keywords. It does not execute or manipulate external data beyond these checks. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. The logic is simple, transparent, and designed solely for policy enforcement. The code's benign nature is evident, and no signs of malware or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, explicit security rule to prevent SQL write operations. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The pattern matching is straightforward, and the code's purpose is clear. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score is appropriately low at 0.1–0.2, reflecting the code's benign and static nature.",
