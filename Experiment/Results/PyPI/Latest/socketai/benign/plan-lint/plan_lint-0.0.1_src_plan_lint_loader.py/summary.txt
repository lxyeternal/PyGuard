  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure data loader with proper validation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified. The code is safe for supply chain purposes, assuming trusted input files."
