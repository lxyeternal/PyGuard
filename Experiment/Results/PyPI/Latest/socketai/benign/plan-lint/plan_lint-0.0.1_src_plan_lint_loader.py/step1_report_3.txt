{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to load plans, schemas, and policies from specified files, mainly for validation and configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "File reads from paths specified in function arguments: 'schema_path', 'plan_path', and 'policy_path'.",
  "sinks": "json.load() and yaml.safe_load() functions which parse file contents into Python data structures.",
  "flows": "File paths are provided as input; files are opened and parsed with json.load() or yaml.safe_load(); data is processed for validation or conversion; finally, data is used to instantiate model objects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of json.load() and yaml.safe_load() involves parsing external input, but these are standard, safe parsing functions. No evidence of code injection or malicious payloads. The only potential concern is the conversion of 'bounds' values to lists, but this is benign data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code reads files specified by the user, parsing JSON and YAML data using standard libraries. Validation steps are performed using jsonschema, which is typical for schema validation. The conversion of 'bounds' to lists is a data normalization step, not suspicious. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. There are no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and all file operations are straightforward. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected. The code adheres to common practices for configuration loading and validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs safe file parsing and data validation operations without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It uses standard libraries and methods suitable for configuration management, with no indicators of malware or supply chain attacks.",
