  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code primarily performs file reading, deserialization (json.load and yaml.safe_load), validation against schemas, and model instantiation.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration routines are present.\n- The deserialization functions used (json.load, yaml.safe_load) are generally safe if used with trusted files.\n- The code validates data schemas, which reduces the risk of malicious payloads.\n- Error handling is present, catching validation and parsing errors.\n- The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No issues are present** in the code logic, security, or implementation based on the provided source. The functions are straightforward and use standard, safe libraries.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only potential concern could be reliance on external files, but this is typical for configuration loading systems and not inherently insecure.\n- The handling of the \"bounds\" field in `load_policy` involves converting values to lists, which is benign.\n- No evidence of insecure deserialization, code injection, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Malware and obfuscation:\n- All reports correctly identify **no malware** or obfuscation present.\n- The scores for malware (0) and obfuscated (0) are appropriate.\n\n### Security risk scores:\n- The overall security risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), reflecting the safe, standard nature of the code.\n- These are reasonable given the context.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- No reason exists to assign a risk higher than 0.5; the code is a standard loader with validation.\n- The only hypothetical concern would be if files are untrusted, but that’s outside the scope of code analysis; the code itself is safe.\n\n### Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- No such claims are made in the reports; they correctly state that the code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n\n| Aspect | Estimated Score | Justification |\n|---------|------------------|----------------|\n| **Malware** | **0** | No malicious code, network activity, or payloads. |\n| **Obfuscated** | **0** | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation. |\n| **Risk** | **0.1** | Low, standard configuration loader with proper validation. No significant security issues. |\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical, well-implemented configuration loader with validation, and there are no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low scores are justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Obfuscated score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0.1\n\nThese reflect the code's benign nature and adherence to safe practices.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to prepare a summarized report or further details?**",
