  "purpose": "The code provides functions to load schemas, plans, and policies from files, primarily for validation and configuration purposes in a larger application.",
  "sources": "File input operations: open() calls reading from schema, plan, and policy files.",
  "sinks": "json.load(), yaml.safe_load(), and the validation functions, which process untrusted data from files.",
  "flows": "File open() -> json.load()/yaml.safe_load() -> validate/parse -> return model objects",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of safe_load() reduces risk of code execution via YAML. The code validates data against schemas, minimizing injection risks.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads data from files using open(). It uses json.load() and yaml.safe_load() which are standard and safe for reading data. The schema validation ensures the data conforms to expected formats, reducing injection risks. No dynamic code execution, eval, or suspicious data handling observed. Exception handling captures and reports errors without executing malicious code. There are no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. The logic appears straightforward and typical for configuration loading.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears secure with no signs of malicious intent. It correctly uses safe loading functions, validates input schemas, and handles exceptions properly. No malicious behaviors or security risks are evident.",
