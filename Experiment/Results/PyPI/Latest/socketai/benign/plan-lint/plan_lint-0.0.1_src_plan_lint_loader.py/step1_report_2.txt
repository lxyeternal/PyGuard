  "purpose": "This module loads plans, schemas, and policies from JSON or YAML files for use in plan-linter.",
  "sources": "File openings (open function calls), reading from provided file paths, loading JSON and YAML content.",
  "sinks": "json.load(), yaml.safe_load(), schema validation, model validation methods.",
  "flows": "File path inputs -> open() -> json.load()/yaml.safe_load() -> data processing/validation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of json.load() and yaml.safe_load() on external files without explicit content validation beyond schema validation. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. Handling of 'bounds' includes type conversions but no risky code injection appears possible.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from files specified by paths, loads JSON and YAML content, and performs validation. The use of json.load() and yaml.safe_load() is standard for loading configuration data. The 'load_schema' function uses os.path to locate a schema file relative to the module directory, which is typical. The 'load_plan' function validates data against a JSON schema, and 'load_policy' handles YAML input with basic data checks and conversions. No suspicious network operations, code execution, or data exfiltration routines are present. The data validation processes are straightforward. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard configuration file loading and validation without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It processes files securely within expected parameters and does not contain suspicious or harmful code behavior.",
