  "purpose": "Load and validate plan, schema, and policy data from files for the plan-linter tool.",
  "sources": "File operations with open(), reading JSON and YAML files, default schema path resolution.",
  "sinks": "json.load() and yaml.safe_load() functions for deserialization.",
  "flows": "File input -> deserialization -> schema validation or model validation -> data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; handling of 'bounds' is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard, safe libraries for file reading and data validation. It performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. Error handling is appropriate, and no malicious patterns are present. The only minor concern is reliance on external files, which is typical for configuration loaders. Validation routines ensure data integrity, and the functions are straightforward. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure data loader with proper validation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified. The code is safe for supply chain purposes, assuming trusted input files.",
