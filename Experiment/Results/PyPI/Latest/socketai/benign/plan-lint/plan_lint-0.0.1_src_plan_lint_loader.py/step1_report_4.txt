  "purpose": "The module provides functions to load and validate plan, schema, and policy data from files, mainly for configuration and validation purposes in the plan-linter system.",
  "sources": "File reading operations: open() calls on schema_path, plan_path, and policy_path; reading JSON and YAML data from these files.",
  "sinks": "json.load() and yaml.safe_load() functions parsing data; validation steps using jsonschema.validate and model_validate, which process the loaded data.",
  "flows": "Input files are opened and read; data is parsed via json.load() or yaml.safe_load(); the data is validated against schemas; then converted into internal models.",
  "anomalies": "Use of jsonschema.validate for validation; no evidence of data being sent over network, or used insecurely. Handling of optional policy_path with default empty Policy() is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data exclusively from local files specified by function arguments or default paths, with no apparent injection points or untrusted external inputs beyond the files. The use of json.load and yaml.safe_load is standard and safe when reading local files. Validation steps are performed properly, and there are no signs of dynamic code execution, remote data fetching, or malicious manipulation. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present. Error handling wraps exceptions for invalid data but does not leak sensitive information or execute unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for loading and validating configuration data with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on local files, employs safe parsing functions, and includes proper validation. There are no signs of supply chain attacks or malicious behavior.",
