  "purpose": "Minimal CLI entry point that imports and executes 'app' from 'plan_lint.cli'.",
  "sources": "Import statement of 'app' from 'plan_lint.cli'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'app()' when run as main, which depends on external implementation.",
  "flows": "From import of 'app' to execution in '__main__' guard.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python CLI bootstrap, importing 'app' and executing it if the script is run directly. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The security implications depend entirely on 'app()' implementation, which is outside this snippet. Malware score is 0, indicating no malicious activity. Risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging external dependencies. Confidence is high due to simplicity and consistency across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign CLI entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score remains at 0. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, and no further action is necessary.",
