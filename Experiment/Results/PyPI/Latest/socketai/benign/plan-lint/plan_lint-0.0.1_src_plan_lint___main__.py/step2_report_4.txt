  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the details:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code simply imports an 'app' object and executes it if run as main. There are no signs of embedded malicious behavior within this fragment.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The reports are consistent that the code is a standard entry point. No logical flaws or mistakes are identified. The behavior depends entirely on the implementation of 'app()' in 'plan_lint.cli', which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n3. **Scores Review:**  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no evidence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.  \n   - **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the minimal code and the dependency on external implementation.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.2. This is appropriate since the code is benign and standard. The risk depends on the implementation of 'app()', which isn't shown.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   The reports avoid assumptions about malicious behavior, focusing on the code structure. This is appropriate.\n\n6. **Score Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no false positives or negatives are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Slight, justifiable given the minimal code and reliance on external implementation.\n\n### My Reasoned Estimates:\n\nGiven the analysis, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slight inherent risk due to external dependencies, but overall benign.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the external 'app()' implementation, which appears to be outside the scope of this fragment.",
