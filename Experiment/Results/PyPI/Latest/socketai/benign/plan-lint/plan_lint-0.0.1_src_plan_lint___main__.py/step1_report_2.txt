  "purpose": "Main entry point for the plan-linter package, initiating the CLI application.",
  "sources": "Importing 'app' from 'plan_lint.cli' and calling it in the main block.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'app()' as the main executable, potential execution of external code within 'app()'.",
  "flows": "Import of 'app' (source) to execution in '__main__' block (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a single function 'app' from 'plan_lint.cli' and executes it if the script is run as the main module. There is no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no suspicious operations. The simplicity suggests it is a standard CLI entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical entry point for a CLI tool with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It relies on the imported 'app' function, which should be reviewed separately for further security assessment.",
