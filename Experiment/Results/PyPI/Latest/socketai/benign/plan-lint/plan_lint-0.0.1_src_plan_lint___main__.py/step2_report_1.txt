  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI entry point, importing 'app' from 'plan_lint.cli' and executing it under the main guard.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The actual behavior and potential risks depend on the implementation of 'app()', which is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious activity detected or suspected in this fragment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and logical assessments:\n- The code matches the description: a minimal, typical Python CLI entry point.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The analysis in each report is consistent and reasonable.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports assign very low security risk scores (mostly 0.1 or 0.2). Given the code's simplicity, this seems appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8 to 1.0), which is justified.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since the core concern for security depends on 'app()', which isn't shown, the overall risk cannot be fully assessed here.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and the absence of suspicious patterns, a risk score of around **0.1** to **0.2** seems appropriate, aligning with the reports.\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the implementation of 'app()'.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0.2 at most, considering dependency on external code)\n\nThis conservative estimate aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
