{
  "purpose": "Main entry point for the plan-linter package, initializing and running the CLI application.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'app' from 'plan_lint.cli'.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'app()' which executes the CLI application logic.",
  "flows": "Import of 'app' (source) to its invocation in the main block (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is minimal and typical for a CLI entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function 'app' from a module and executes it if the script is run directly. No user input is directly read here; input handling likely occurs within 'app()'. The structure is standard for CLI programs and contains no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a standard, benign entry point for a command-line tool with no malicious intent or security risks detected in this code segment.",
