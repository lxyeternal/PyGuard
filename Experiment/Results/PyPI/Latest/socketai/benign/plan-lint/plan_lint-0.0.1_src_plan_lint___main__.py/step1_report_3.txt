  "purpose": "Main entry point for the plan-linter package, launching the CLI application.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'app' from 'plan_lint.cli', execution trigger in 'if __name__ == \"__main__\":'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'app()' function, which likely starts the CLI interface; no direct data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Imported 'app' function is invoked when the script runs directly, leading to the CLI starting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward entry point script without embedded suspicious code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python entry point that imports a CLI application and runs it if executed directly. No suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure is simple and standard for CLI applications. No external data sources or sinks indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign entry point for a CLI tool. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
