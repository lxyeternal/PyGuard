  "purpose": "Main entry point for the plan-linter package, initiating the CLI application.",
  "sources": "Importing 'app' from 'plan_lint.cli'.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'app()' as the main execution, which could execute arbitrary code defined within the CLI app.",
  "flows": "Import 'app' -> execute 'app()' in main block.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code structures detected. The code is straightforward and typical for a CLI entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a CLI application object and executes it if run as the main script. There are no visible malicious activities, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection. Since the actual behavior depends on the implementation of 'app', which is not shown, the code itself appears benign. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a basic entry point for a CLI application without any indication of malicious intent or security issues based solely on this snippet. The security risk is minimal, but full safety depends on the implementation of 'app'.",
