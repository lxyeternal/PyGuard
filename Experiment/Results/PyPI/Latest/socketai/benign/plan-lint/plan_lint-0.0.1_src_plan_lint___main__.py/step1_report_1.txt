  "flows": "Import of 'app' -> execution of 'app()' in main guard.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual patterns. The code simply invokes a CLI application.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an application object 'app' from a module and executes it if run as the main program. No user input handling, data processing, or network operations are visible here. The behavior depends entirely on the implementation of 'app()'. Since 'app()' is called directly without any dynamic code execution or suspicious constructs, and no malicious code appears in this fragment, the code appears to be a standard entry point. The risk is tied to the 'plan_lint.cli' module, which is outside the provided scope.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward entry point for a CLI application. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident in this snippet. Security concerns are dependent on the implementation of 'app()' in 'plan_lint.cli'.",
