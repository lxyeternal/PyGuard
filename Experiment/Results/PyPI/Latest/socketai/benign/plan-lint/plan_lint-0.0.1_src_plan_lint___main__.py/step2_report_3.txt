  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI entry point, importing an 'app' function from 'plan_lint.cli' and executing it if run as the main program.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are detected within this fragment.\n- The behavior and potential security issues depend entirely on the implementation of 'app()' in 'plan_lint.cli', which is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code itself is benign and standard for CLI applications.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security flaws in this fragment.\n\n**Issues in the reports:**\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- The risk scores are generally low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal security concern based solely on this code.\n- The confidence levels are high, indicating the reviewers are certain about their assessments.\n\n**Points to challenge or clarify:**\n- The reports correctly note that the security risk depends on 'app()' implementation. If 'app()' contains malicious code, the risk would be higher, but that cannot be inferred from this fragment.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Since the code is a simple entry point, and no malicious activity is evident, the scores seem reasonable.\n- The security risk score could be slightly increased if there is suspicion that 'app()' might execute untrusted code, but without evidence, keeping it low is justified.\n- The malware score should remain at 0 unless further evidence suggests malicious behavior within 'app()'.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code fragment is benign.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- The overall security posture based on this code is minimal risk, but full assessment requires review of 'plan_lint.cli'.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (reasonable given the context)\n- **Confidence:** High\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard CLI entry point with no inherent security issues. The security and malware scores are justified as zero, assuming no malicious code exists within 'app()'. The overall risk is minimal based on this fragment.",
