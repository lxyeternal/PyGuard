  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, data handling functions, network calls, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file writes, environment variable access, data output functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as data inputs or environment variables flow into processing functions, which may lead to network transmission or file storage sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious obfuscation, inconsistent variable naming, minimal or missing code, hardcoded strings, unusual import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign with straightforward logic, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious indicators. Obfuscation suspicion in some snippets is moderate but not definitive. Missing or minimal code in some reports limits analysis. No evidence of malicious activity or backdoors. Obfuscation scores are justified where suspicion exists. Overall, the code is low risk with minor concerns about obfuscation. Confidence is high in benign assessment; suspicion of obfuscation slightly lowers confidence in some cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is predominantly benign with minimal obfuscation suspicion. Malware presence is unlikely. Scores are consistent with the analysis. Slight adjustments to malware and obfuscation scores can improve accuracy, but current scores are reasonable.",
