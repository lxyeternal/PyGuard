{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python package designed for general utility or application logic, but specific functionality is not clear due to lack of context or comments.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and possibly from user inputs via function parameters or standard input streams.",
  "sinks": "Data may flow into output functions, network calls, or file write operations, but specific sink points are not explicitly detailed without code snippets.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from environment variables or user input flows into functions or processes that could potentially lead to output or network transmission, though explicit paths are not evident in the absence of concrete code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation techniques are observed. The code uses standard Python practices without unusual language features or unnecessary dynamic execution. No hidden or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or non-existent in the provided snippet, with no evidence of malicious constructs or security risks. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, appears standard. No anomalous data handling, code injection points, or malicious logic are identified. The absence of detailed code limits confidence but suggests typical, benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, the code shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be standard application code without obfuscated or suspicious elements. Due to limited content, confidence is moderate.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
