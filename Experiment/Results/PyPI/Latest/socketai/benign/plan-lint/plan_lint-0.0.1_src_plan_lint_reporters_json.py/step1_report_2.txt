  "purpose": "Provides functionality to render validation results as JSON for a plan linter.",
  "sources": "Reads validation result objects from the 'plan_lint.types' module.",
  "sinks": "Uses json.dumps to serialize data; writes to optional file-like output.",
  "flows": "ValidationResult object -> to_dict() -> json.dumps() -> output (if provided).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines functions for converting validation results into JSON format. It uses standard library functions and type annotations. No external data inputs are processed directly, and there are no network calls, code injections, or suspicious data handling. The 'ValidationResult' is imported but not manipulated maliciously. The process is straightforward: convert object to dict, serialize to JSON, optionally write to a file, and return JSON string.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple JSON reporter for validation results without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears secure and benign.",
