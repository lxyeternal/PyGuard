  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, system files, network activity, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, external inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system, environment variables, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or hardcoded secrets flow into network activity, system commands, or dynamic execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, network activity, suspicious patterns indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in most reports, with no suspicious activity or obfuscation. Report 4 shows notable suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network activity, indicating potential malicious intent. The initial malware score of 0.4 for Report 4 underestimates the suspicion level; considering the described patterns, increasing it to 0.7 is justified. Obfuscation score remains high at 0.8, consistent with the presence of obfuscation techniques. Other reports are benign, with scores appropriately set to zero or low values. The overall risk assessment aligns with the suspicion levels, with Report 4 warranting a higher malware and risk score.",
  "conclusion": "Most code segments are benign, with no malicious indicators. Report 4 displays significant suspicious patterns, justifying an increase in malware score from 0.4 to 0.7 and risk score from 0.6 to 0.7. The obfuscation score remains justified at 0.8. Adjusting these scores better reflects the potential threat level based on the described behaviors.",
