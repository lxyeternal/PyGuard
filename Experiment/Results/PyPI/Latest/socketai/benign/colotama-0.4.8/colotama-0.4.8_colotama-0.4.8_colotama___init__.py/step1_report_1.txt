  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing the 'cli' function or object from the 'cli' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'cli' from the current package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there is no execution of untrusted input or external data.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no input/output flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious constructs or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package initializer that imports 'cli' from a local module. It contains no user input handling, network communication, or data processing. It does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or any malicious patterns. The structure is typical for Python packages, and no anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a basic package initialization file with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
