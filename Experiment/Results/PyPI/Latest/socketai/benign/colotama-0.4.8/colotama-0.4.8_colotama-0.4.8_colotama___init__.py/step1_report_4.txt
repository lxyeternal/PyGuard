{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a package by importing a CLI component for command-line interface functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .cli import cli indicates reading the 'cli' module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or potentially harmful operations.",
  "flows": "The package likely uses the 'cli' component when invoked, but no data flows are explicit in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal init file that only imports a 'cli' component. It does not perform any operations, data processing, or contain code that could be malicious. The structure is typical for a Python package setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple initializer for a CLI-based package. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
