  "purpose": "Package initialization for the 'colotama' module, exposing the 'cli' component.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .cli module",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Importing 'cli' from local module during package load",
  "anomalies": "None observed; minimal code, no suspicious constructs or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py file that imports 'cli' from a local module. It contains no input handling, network activity, or data processing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and standard pattern suggest benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The import statement is standard for Python package initialization, and no suspicious behavior is detected.",
