  "purpose": "Attempt to initialize and use the pyprettifier.EmojiConverter if the package is available; otherwise, log the import error to a temporary file.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pyprettifier', writing to '/tmp/a' in case of ImportError",
  "sinks": "Writing error message to '/tmp/a', which could potentially be accessed or manipulated, but not inherently malicious",
  "flows": "Import 'pyprettifier' -> instantiate 'EmojiConverter' -> on ImportError, write to '/tmp/a'",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code detected; the code only attempts to import and instantiate a class, and logs errors to a temp file",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function 'after_install' that tries to import 'pyprettifier' and create an 'EmojiConverter' object. If the import fails, it logs the error to '/tmp/a'. This could be used for debugging or error tracking. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no code injection, and no malicious behavior observed. The code appears to be benign, serving a utility or setup purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not contain malicious intent. It attempts a conditional import and logs errors, which is typical for setup or optional feature handling. No security risks or malware are detected.",
