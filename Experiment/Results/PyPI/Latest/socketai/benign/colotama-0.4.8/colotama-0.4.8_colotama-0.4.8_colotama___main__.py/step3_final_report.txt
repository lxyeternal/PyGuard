  "flows": "Import attempt -> exception handling -> writing to '/tmp/a'",
  "anomalies": "Writing exception message to a fixed file path '/tmp/a', which could be used for signaling but is standard for error logs",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import with error handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data exfiltration is present. Writing to '/tmp/a' is a common error logging pattern, though the fixed path could be slightly suspicious if exploited. No complex flows or secrets are involved. The scores across reports are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import check with error logging. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The minor concern about writing to a fixed log file does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent.",
