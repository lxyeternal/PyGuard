  "conclusion": "The code contains potentially malicious behavior by executing arbitrary scripts during installation, which could compromise systems if the scripts are malicious or tampered with. The actions justify high malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated, but the execution of external code during setup is a significant security concern."
