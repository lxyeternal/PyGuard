{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script that installs the 'colotama' package and executes a post-install task which installs 'pyprettifier' and runs a script named 'colotama' from the installation directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads the installation directory path ('dir') and the system's executable path ('sys.executable') to run commands; it also reads the 'colotama' script from the installation directory.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'colotama' script via subprocess call; installation of 'pyprettifier' via pip during setup.",
  "flows": "The setup process triggers '_post_install', which runs 'pip install pyprettifier' and then executes the 'colotama' script from the installation directory.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of arbitrary scripts during installation without validation; use of 'shell=True' with formatted strings; running external code during setup; no validation or sanitization of the 'colotama' script.",
  "analysis": "The code executes a pip install command and runs an external script during setup, which could be malicious if the script or package is compromised. The code is straightforward but performs actions that are risky in supply chain security, such as executing unverified code during installation. The use of 'shell=True' increases potential for command injection if variables are manipulated. The lack of validation or verification of the 'colotama' script indicates a high security concern. The reports are empty, but based on the code, the actions suggest high malicious potential and risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains potentially malicious behavior by executing arbitrary scripts during installation, which could compromise systems if the scripts are malicious or tampered with. The actions justify high malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated, but the execution of external code during setup is a significant security concern.",
