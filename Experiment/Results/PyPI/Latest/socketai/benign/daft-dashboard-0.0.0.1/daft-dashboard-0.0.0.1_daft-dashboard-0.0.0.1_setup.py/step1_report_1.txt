  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields; no suspicious code, backdoors, or unusual behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with basic package metadata, including name, version, description, and classifiers. All fields are either standard or empty placeholders. No dynamic code, user input, or secret handling present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, non-malicious package setup script with placeholder metadata. There are no suspicious or malicious indicators.",
