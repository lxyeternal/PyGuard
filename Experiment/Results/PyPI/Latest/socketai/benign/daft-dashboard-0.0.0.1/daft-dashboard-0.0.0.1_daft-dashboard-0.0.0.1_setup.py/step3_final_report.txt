  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, author, author_email, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields; unconventional version string '0.0.0.1'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static, hardcoded metadata. No dynamic input, no code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The anomalies (empty author fields and unusual version) are benign placeholders. No suspicious patterns, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with placeholder metadata. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. The existing scores accurately reflect its safety, and no modifications are necessary.",
