  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'daft-dashboard' Python package",
  "sources": "Import statement for setuptools, and setup() function call with package metadata",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines package metadata",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields, but this is not inherently suspicious; no hidden code or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It imports the setup function and invokes it with package metadata, including name, version, description, and classifiers. There are no dynamic or malicious elements, no user input handling, and no code execution beyond standard library calls. The code appears to be a placeholder or minimal setup script, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
