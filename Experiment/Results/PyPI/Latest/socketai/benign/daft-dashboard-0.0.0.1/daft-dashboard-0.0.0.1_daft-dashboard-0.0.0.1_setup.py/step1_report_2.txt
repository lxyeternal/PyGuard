  "purpose": "Define the metadata and configuration for packaging the Python project 'daft-dashboard'.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function and its parameters, specifically 'name', 'version', 'author', 'author_email', 'description', and 'classifiers'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields are unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. The version string '0.0.0.1' is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network activity, file modification, or obfuscated code. The parameters are straightforward and typical for a package configuration, with minor anomalies like empty author fields and an unusual version number, which are not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual version and empty author fields are not security issues but are atypical. Overall, it appears safe.",
