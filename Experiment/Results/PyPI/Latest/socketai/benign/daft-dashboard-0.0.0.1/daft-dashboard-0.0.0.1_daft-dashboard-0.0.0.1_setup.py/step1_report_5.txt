  "purpose": "Define and configure the metadata for a Python package named 'daft-dashboard'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string literals for package metadata; no input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform data output, network operations, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sensitive data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The version string '0.0.0.1' is unconventional but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with package metadata, including name, version, author details, description, and classifiers. It appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic is present. The code simply defines package metadata without performing any other actions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical package setup script.",
