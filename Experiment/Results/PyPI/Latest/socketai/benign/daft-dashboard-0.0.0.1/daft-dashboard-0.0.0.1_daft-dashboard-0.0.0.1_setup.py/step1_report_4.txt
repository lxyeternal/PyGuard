  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'daft-dashboard' with basic metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement for setuptools, package metadata fields (name, version, author, email, description, classifiers).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no sinks where data could leak or be misused.",
  "flows": "Import from setuptools → setup() call with static metadata, no dynamic or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures; all code is standard package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls 'setup()' with static, hardcoded package metadata. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns. The package description indicates it's a placeholder, and no credentials, network calls, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It functions as a basic package metadata definition without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
