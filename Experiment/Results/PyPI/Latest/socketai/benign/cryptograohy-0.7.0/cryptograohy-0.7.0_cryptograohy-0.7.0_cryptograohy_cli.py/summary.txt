  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import and error logging. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The minimal security concern relates to error info leakage, which is common in debugging but not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
