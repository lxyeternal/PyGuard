  "purpose": "Attempt to import 'pyprettifier' and convert a string to emojis; log import errors to a temporary file.",

  "flows": "Import attempt -> success or failure -> error message written to '/tmp/a' if failure.",
  "anomalies": "Logging import error details to a temporary file; no other unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly attempts to import a module and instantiate an object. If the import fails, it logs the error to a temp file. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious commands are present. The error logging could leak error details but is typical for debugging. No obfuscation or malicious code detected. The code's simplicity and benign behavior are consistent across reports. The error message logging is the only minor concern, but it does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import and error logging. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The minimal security concern relates to error info leakage, which is common in debugging but not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
