  "purpose": "The script attempts to import the 'pyprettifier' library and uses it to instantiate an EmojiConverter object, then processes a hardcoded string. If the library is not present, it logs the error to a file.",
  "sources": "The import statement for 'pyprettifier' and the hardcoded string 'Hello, World!'.",
  "sinks": "Writing to '/tmp/a' when ImportError occurs.",
  "flows": "Import 'pyprettifier' -> instantiate EmojiConverter -> process string; ImportError -> log error to file.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the writing of error details to a temporary file, which is standard logging; no suspicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports a library, creates an object, and processes a string. Error handling writes to a temp file, which is benign. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious system interactions. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import and object creation with minimal error handling. It does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior. The only notable action is logging an import error, which is benign.",
