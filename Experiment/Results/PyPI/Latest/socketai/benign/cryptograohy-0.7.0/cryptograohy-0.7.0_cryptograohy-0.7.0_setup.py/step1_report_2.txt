  "purpose": "To configure and prepare the 'cryptograohy' package for installation via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading package information, author details, dependencies, and entry points from the setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'cryptograohy.cli:cli' entry point, but no direct untrusted data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Package metadata flows from setup() parameters to the installation process; no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in package name ('cryptograohy' instead of 'cryptography'), but no malicious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious code operations are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No external input handling, no suspicious code execution, no obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The typo in the package name may be a mistake or an attempt to mimic a legitimate package, but it is not malicious per se. No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with a typographical error in the package name. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code snippet.",
