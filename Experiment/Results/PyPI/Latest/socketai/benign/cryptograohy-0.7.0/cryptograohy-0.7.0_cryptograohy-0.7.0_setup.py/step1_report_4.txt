{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package named 'cryptograohy' with its configuration details for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version, author info), dependencies ('pyprettifier'), and entry point for CLI commands.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from metadata and dependencies to the package installation process, but no data flows from external sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'cryptograohy' appears misspelled, which could indicate a typo or attempt to mimic a legitimate package. No other anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily uses setuptools to define package metadata and configuration. It includes no dynamic code execution, user input, or environment variable usage. The misspelled package name may be a typo or an attempt at obfuscation or typo-squatting. There are no suspicious network calls, credential handling, or code injections. The code appears straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a potentially suspicious package name typo but no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It warrants a review of the package name for legitimacy.",
