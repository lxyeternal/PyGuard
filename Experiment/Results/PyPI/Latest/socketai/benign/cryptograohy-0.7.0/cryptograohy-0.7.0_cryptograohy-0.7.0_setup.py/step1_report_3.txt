{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'cryptograohy', used to configure and install the package with specified dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user-provided package name, version, author info, and install_requires dependencies, specifically the 'pyprettifier' package.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the package installation process and execution of the 'cryptograohy.cli:cli' entry point, which could run code upon installation or execution.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the setup configuration into the installation process and triggers execution of the CLI entry point, potentially running the 'cli' function in 'cryptograohy.cli' module.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated sections, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be standard setup script with typical parameters.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic. The only minor concern is the misspelling of 'cryptograohy' which might be a typo but not malicious. No dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for package distribution with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply sets up the package 'cryptograohy' with its dependencies and CLI entry point.",
