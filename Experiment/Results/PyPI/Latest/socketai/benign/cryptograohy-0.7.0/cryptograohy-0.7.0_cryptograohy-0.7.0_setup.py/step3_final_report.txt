  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points for the 'cryptograohy' package.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including package name, version, author info, install_requires, and entry_points.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform runtime actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Static configuration data flows from the setup script to the package installer; no dynamic or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'cryptograohy' is consistently misspelled, which could be accidental or an attempt at typo-squatting. No other anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration with no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. The only notable point is the misspelling of the package name, which could be benign or malicious. All reports correctly identify the code as benign with malware and obfuscation scores of 0. The risk scores are low (around 0.1-0.2), justified mainly by the typo suspicion. No evidence of malicious intent or malicious code is present. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the overall assessment is that the package is benign, with the only concern being the package name typo that warrants further verification outside this code review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only potential issue is the misspelled package name, which could be accidental or an attempt at typo-squatting. No security risks are evident from this code snippet.",
