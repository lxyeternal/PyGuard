{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'cryptograohy', intended to configure package metadata and installation requirements.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package information (name, version, author, email, requirements) and package directories. It does not take external input data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or user input; the script only defines package installation parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the script purely defines package configuration without dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'cryptograohy' appears misspelled (likely intended as 'cryptography'), which could be a typo or an attempt to mimic legitimate packages. No other anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It specifies a package named 'cryptograohy' with a dependency on 'pyprettifier'. No code execution, network activity, or dynamic behaviors are present. The misspelling of 'cryptography' is suspicious but could be accidental or a tactic to evade detection. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a standard package configuration file with a potential typo in the package name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code. The misspelling might be an innocent mistake or an attempt to mimic legitimate packages, but no malicious intent can be confirmed solely from this code.",
