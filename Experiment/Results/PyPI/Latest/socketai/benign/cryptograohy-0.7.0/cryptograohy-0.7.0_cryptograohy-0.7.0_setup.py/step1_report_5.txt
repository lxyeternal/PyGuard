{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'cryptograohy', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Input data from setup() parameters such as package name, author info, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; setup script primarily defines package metadata and dependencies without executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "N/A – the script does not process untrusted input or data flows; it only sets up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in package name ('cryptograohy' instead of 'cryptography'), but no malicious anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a package configuration. No user input or external data processing occurs. The code is straightforward, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and console scripts. The misspelled package name appears to be a typographical error rather than malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The setup script does not perform any runtime actions beyond package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with a typographical error in the package name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign package configuration script.",
