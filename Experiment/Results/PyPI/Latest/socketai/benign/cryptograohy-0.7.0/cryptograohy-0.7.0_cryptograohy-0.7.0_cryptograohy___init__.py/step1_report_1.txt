  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package and invoke its command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'cli' object from the local module 'cli'.",
  "sinks": "Calling the 'cli()' function, which may execute command-line interface code.",
  "flows": "Import of 'cli' -> execution of 'cli()' function upon import.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a 'cli' function or object from a local module and immediately executes it. This pattern is typical for CLI entry points. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Since the 'cli' function's implementation is not provided, potential malicious behavior could originate there, but from this snippet alone, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code initializes a CLI tool by executing 'cli()' on import. There is no visible malicious activity or security risk in this fragment; it appears to be standard CLI entry point code.",
