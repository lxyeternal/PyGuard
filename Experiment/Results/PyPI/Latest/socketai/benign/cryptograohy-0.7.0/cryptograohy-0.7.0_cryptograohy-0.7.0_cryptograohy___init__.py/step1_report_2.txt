  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by executing its CLI command.",
  "sources": "Importing 'cli' from the local module 'cli'.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'cli()' which likely executes command-line interface functionality.",
  "flows": "Import of 'cli' -> invocation of 'cli()' function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'cli' function from a local module and immediately executes it. This suggests that when the package is imported, it will run its command-line interface. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or other suspicious activities visible. The code is minimal and standard for CLI entry points, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply initializes and runs the CLI component of the package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
