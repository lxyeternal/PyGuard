  "purpose": "Standard CLI entry point that imports and executes the 'cli()' function upon module import.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.cli' module; execution of 'cli()' function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'cli()' which may process untrusted input or perform actions, but not evident from this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import of 'cli' -> immediate call to 'cli()' upon import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in this minimal code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pattern for CLI tools in Python, importing a 'cli' function and executing it immediately. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The security risk and malware scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of this pattern. Without inspecting the 'cli()' implementation, malicious behavior cannot be confirmed, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point with no evidence of malicious activity or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
