  "purpose": "Import and execute the CLI entry point for the asciidrawing package.",
  "sources": "The module imports the 'cli' function from the local 'cli' module.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'cli()' likely invokes command-line interface code which may accept user input.",
  "flows": "Import 'cli' -> invoke 'cli()' function",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward import and invocation of CLI function.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports the 'cli' function from a local module and executes it immediately. This pattern is common in command-line tool packages to run the interface when the package is executed as a script. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns such as hidden network calls, data leaks, or obfuscated code. It does not handle any sensitive data directly or contain code that could be exploited maliciously in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical entry point for a CLI tool, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
