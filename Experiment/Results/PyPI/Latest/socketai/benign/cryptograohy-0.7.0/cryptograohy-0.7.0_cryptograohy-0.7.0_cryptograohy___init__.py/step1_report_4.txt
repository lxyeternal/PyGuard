  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by invoking its command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Importing cli from the local module 'cli'.",
  "sinks": "Calling the cli() function, which may execute code or scripts.",
  "flows": "Importing 'cli' and immediately executing cli(), which runs the command-line interface logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets detected; straightforward import and function call.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'cli' object from the local module 'cli' and immediately invokes it. This pattern is typical for CLI entry points. No external data input sources, environment variable manipulations, or network communications are evident. The code is minimal and appears standard for a CLI wrapper. Without inspecting the 'cli' implementation, no malicious behavior can be confirmed, but based on this fragment alone, it seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as an entry point for a command-line interface by calling a function imported from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
