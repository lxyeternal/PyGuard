{
  "purpose": "This code defines a server for handling a 'say hello' tool, which responds with a greeting message based on input.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from 'arguments' in 'call_tool' function; input schema is defined via pydantic 'SayHelloInput'.",
  "sinks": "Output is sent as a list of 'TextContent' objects; potential for data leakage if untrusted data is mishandled, but currently only echoes input.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are validated and then used to generate a greeting message; no external or untrusted data flows outside controlled input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward server setup.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a server with tool listing and calling capabilities. It uses standard libraries and well-defined data models. The 'call_tool' function only constructs a greeting message based on validated input, with no external network or system interactions. The error response in case of invalid tool names is well-contained. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or potential malware signals are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a server handling a simple 'say hello' function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a straightforward, safe, and controlled example.",
