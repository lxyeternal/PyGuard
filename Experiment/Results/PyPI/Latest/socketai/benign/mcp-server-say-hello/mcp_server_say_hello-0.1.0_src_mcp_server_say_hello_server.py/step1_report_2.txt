{
  "purpose": "This code implements a simple MCP server that registers a 'say_hello' tool to respond with a greeting message based on input.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'arguments' parameter in the 'call_tool' function; 'arguments' are provided externally when invoking the tool.",
  "sinks": "The 'arguments' are used to construct a 'SayHelloInput' object, which is then used to generate a response. The response is a TextContent object. The code does not write data to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'arguments' flows into 'SayHelloInput(**arguments)', then used to generate a greeting string. No external network or file sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic. It relies on well-known libraries. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The server registers a tool 'say_hello' that accepts a 'name' parameter. When invoked, it returns a greeting message. The code uses standard async functions, the pydantic library for data validation, and proper enum usage. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No external network connections are made, and the code does not process or store sensitive data beyond constructing and returning a greeting message. The structure and logic are clear and typical for a plugin-like server implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a simple greeting server tool. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks.",
