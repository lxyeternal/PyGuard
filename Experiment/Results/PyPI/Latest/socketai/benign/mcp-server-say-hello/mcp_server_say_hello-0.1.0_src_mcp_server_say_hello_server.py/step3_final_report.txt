  "purpose": "A Python async MCP server providing a 'say_hello' tool that greets the user by name.",
  "sources": "Input arguments 'arguments' parsed into SayHelloInput; no external data sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "Response via TextContent objects; error message serialized with json.dumps.",
  "flows": "Arguments received, validated, and used to generate a greeting; error handling serializes error info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward async server with input validation and response formatting. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with no external network interactions or secrets. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The error message uses json.dumps, which is standard and safe in this context. The overall structure and flow are clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a greeting server tool. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The security and malware scores are appropriately low, with no indications of sabotage or malicious intent.",
