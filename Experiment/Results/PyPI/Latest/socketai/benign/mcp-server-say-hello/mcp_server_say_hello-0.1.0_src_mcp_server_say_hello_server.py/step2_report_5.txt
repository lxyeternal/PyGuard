  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a simple, asynchronous MCP server exposing a \"say_hello\" tool.\n- Input is validated via Pydantic, and responses are straightforward.\n- No network calls, no secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- All reports consistently conclude benign intent, with malware scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's purpose and data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No issues; standard libraries, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) is acceptable, given the minimal potential for issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scoring:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, correct.\n- **Security Risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable given the simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal security risk, consistent with the reports.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and their scores are reasonable. No adjustments needed. The code is a safe, benign implementation of a greeting server.",
