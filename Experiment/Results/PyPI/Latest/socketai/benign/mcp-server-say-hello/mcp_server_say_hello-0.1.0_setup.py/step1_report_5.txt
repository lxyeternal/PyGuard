  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'mcp_server_say_hello', including package discovery, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration parameters and dependencies from the script itself; specifically, the package source directory 'src' and the listed dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Installation process that might trigger package installation or build steps; entry point 'mcp-say-hello' execution point calling '__main__.main' within the package.",
  "flows": "The setup script reads configuration data, installs dependencies, and registers entry points; no untrusted data flows are evident in this static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code constructs, or unusual behaviors are present. The code strictly adheres to standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script employs standard setuptools methods to define a Python package, including package discovery in the 'src' directory, dependency specification, and console script entry point. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated parts, or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a typical package setup script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
