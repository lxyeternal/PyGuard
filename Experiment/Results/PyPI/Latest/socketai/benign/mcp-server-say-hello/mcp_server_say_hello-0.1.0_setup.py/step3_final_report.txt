  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for a Python project, defining dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static configuration data within setup(), find_packages(), and install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input is processed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with static package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing is involved. All five reviews correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence scores. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the script. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are detected. The entry point references a main function in the package, but without inspecting the actual implementation, there is no evidence of malicious intent. The dependencies are common for web services, and the package structure is standard.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
