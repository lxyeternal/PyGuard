{
  "purpose": "Defines package setup configuration for the 'mcp_server_say_hello' Python project, specifying dependencies, package location, and entry point for installation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for package name, version, package directory, dependencies, and entry point. No external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data flows are present. The setup configuration does not execute or incorporate untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script solely contains static configuration for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code follows standard setup patterns without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setuptools setup script. It specifies package details, dependencies, and entry points without any dynamic code execution or untrusted data handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The dependencies are common for web services and do not suggest malicious intent. No anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
