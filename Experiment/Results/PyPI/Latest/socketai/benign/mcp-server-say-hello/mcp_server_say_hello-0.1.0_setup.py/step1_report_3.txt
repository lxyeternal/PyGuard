  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The setup script reads static package information and dependencies; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions from setuptools, defines package metadata, specifies package location, dependencies, and entry points. All elements are static configuration with no dynamic execution or user input. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code follows standard packaging practices and does not contain any code that could be malicious or maliciously manipulated.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup configuration script for a Python package. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
