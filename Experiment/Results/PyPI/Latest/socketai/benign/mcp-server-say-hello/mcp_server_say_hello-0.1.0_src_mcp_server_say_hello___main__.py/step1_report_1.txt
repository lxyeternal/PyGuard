{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main function from the 'mcp_server_say_hello' module, likely to start a server or a process that says hello.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from 'mcp_server_say_hello', and the call to 'main()'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function from the imported module, which could contain further untrusted actions.",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' from 'mcp_server_say_hello' → call to 'main()' executes the imported function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a main function from a module and executes it. No additional logic, data handling, or security-sensitive operations are visible. The behavior depends entirely on the contents of 'mcp_server_say_hello', which is not provided. The minimal code structure does not show signs of obfuscation or malicious activity directly.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward entry point that calls a main function from another module. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this snippet alone. The overall security depends on the implementation of 'mcp_server_say_hello'.",
