  "purpose": "The script imports a main function from a module named 'mcp_server_say_hello' and executes it.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from 'mcp_server_say_hello' module.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function which may contain untrusted operations depending on the module's implementation.",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' from the module, followed by execution of 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in this snippet; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function 'main' from a local module and immediately calls it. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'mcp_server_say_hello.main', which is not provided. The code itself appears benign and standard for a Python entry point.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this minimal script, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security depends on the imported module's implementation. The code appears legitimate and safe.",
