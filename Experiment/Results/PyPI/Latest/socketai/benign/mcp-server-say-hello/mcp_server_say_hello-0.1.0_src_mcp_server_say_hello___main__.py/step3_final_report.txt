  "purpose": "A minimal Python script that imports and executes the main function from an external module, serving as an entry point.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from 'mcp_server_say_hello'",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' which depends on external module implementation",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' -> execution of 'main()' function",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple script importing and executing a function from another module. Its security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'mcp_server_say_hello.main()'. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code itself appears benign, with minimal risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1-0.2) are consistent with this assessment. Without inspecting the external module, the potential for malicious behavior cannot be confirmed, but the code snippet itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward entry point with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the external module's implementation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
