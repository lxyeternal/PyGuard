  "review": "Let's analyze these reports and the code snippet step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n```python\n# __main__.py\nfrom mcp_server_say_hello import main\nmain()\n```\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n- The code is minimal, importing a single function `main` from the module `mcp_server_say_hello`.\n- It then immediately calls `main()`.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are visible.\n- The behavior entirely depends on the implementation of `mcp_server_say_hello.main()`, which is not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are directly present in this code snippet.\n- **Security concerns:** None apparent at this level; the code is straightforward.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports correctly identify that the security implications depend on the imported module's implementation.\n- No flawed reasoning or assumptions are evident in the reports; they appropriately state that the code appears benign but that the actual risk depends on `mcp_server_say_hello`.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`. This is reasonable given the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal risk based on this code alone. This seems appropriate, considering the code is a simple entry point.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.2, which aligns with the minimal code and the unknown content of the imported module.\n- Since the code is a straightforward import and call, higher risk scores would be unjustified unless the imported module is malicious, which cannot be determined here.\n\n### Malware Score Justification:\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is justified given the minimal code and no signs of malicious activity.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- All reports assume that the security risk depends on the imported module, which is correct.\n- No report claims any suspicious behavior based solely on this snippet, which is appropriate.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Estimated scores based on the provided snippet and reports:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.1** |\n\n- **Malware:** 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1, reflecting minimal risk due to reliance on external code, which could potentially be malicious, but cannot be assessed here.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code itself is benign, and the security implications hinge entirely on the implementation of `mcp_server_say_hello.main()`. Given the information, I agree with the assigned scores and see no reason to adjust them.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain scores at Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.",
