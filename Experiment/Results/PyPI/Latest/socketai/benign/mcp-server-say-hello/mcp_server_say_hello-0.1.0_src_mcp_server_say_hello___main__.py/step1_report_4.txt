  "analysis": "The script imports the main function from a module named mcp_server_say_hello and executes it. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code in this snippet. The behavior appears straightforward and typical for a startup script. Without inspecting the mcp_server_say_hello module itself, no malicious activity can be identified here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple script to run the main function of an imported module. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
