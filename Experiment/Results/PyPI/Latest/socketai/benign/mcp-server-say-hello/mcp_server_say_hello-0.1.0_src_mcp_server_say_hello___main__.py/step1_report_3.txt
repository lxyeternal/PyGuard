{
  "purpose": "The script imports and executes the main function from the 'mcp_server_say_hello' module, likely to start a server or application that says hello.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the import statement and the execution of the 'main' function in the 'mcp_server_say_hello' module.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of 'main()' could lead to various actions depending on the imported module, potentially including network communication, file operations, or other system actions.",
  "flows": "Code execution flows from the import statement to the call to 'main()' in the imported module, which then executes whatever logic is contained within that function.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns in this minimal script. It only imports and runs a function.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward, importing a single function and executing it. Without access to the 'mcp_server_say_hello' module, no further assessment can be made. The code itself does not contain malicious patterns or hardcoded secrets. It relies entirely on the imported module's implementation, which could potentially contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code by itself appears benign and serves as a launcher for the 'mcp_server_say_hello' module. No malicious behavior is evident from the snippet provided, though the security risk depends on the content of the imported module.",
