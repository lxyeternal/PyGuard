{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main function from the mcp_server_say_hello module, likely to run a server or process that outputs a greeting.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data directly; it relies on the imported module, which is not shown.",
  "sinks": "The code calls the main() function, which could potentially execute any code, including malicious actions, but no specific sinks are identifiable in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow is visible; the only flow is from import to function call within main().",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports and runs a main function from another module. Without access to the implementation of 'mcp_server_say_hello', we cannot evaluate its behavior. The code itself is standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Its simplicity suggests standard operation, though full assessment depends on the contents of 'mcp_server_say_hello'.",
