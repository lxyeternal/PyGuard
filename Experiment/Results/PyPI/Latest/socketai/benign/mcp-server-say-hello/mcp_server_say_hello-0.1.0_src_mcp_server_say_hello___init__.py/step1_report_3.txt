{
  "purpose": "To run an asynchronous server component by importing and executing the 'serve' function from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.server' module, invocation of 'serve()' function within asyncio.run()",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks, network calls, or external effects are evident in this snippet",
  "flows": "The code imports 'serve' from a local module and executes it within an asyncio event loop",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The script imports a 'serve' function from a relative module, then runs it asynchronously when executed as the main program. Without the implementation details of 'serve', there is no indication of malicious activity. The code appears to be a typical entry point for a server application, relying on external, presumably safe, logic. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this limited code fragment, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is a standard server launcher pattern. However, full assurance depends on the implementation of the 'serve' function in the 'server' module.",
