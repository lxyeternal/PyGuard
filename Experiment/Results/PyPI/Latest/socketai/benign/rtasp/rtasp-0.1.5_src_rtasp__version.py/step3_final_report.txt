  "purpose": "Provides static version information for the rtasp package.",
  "sources": "Reads a hardcoded version string '__version__' and assigns it to 'version'.",
  "sinks": "Returns the version string via get_version(), no untrusted data involved.",
  "flows": "Source: static variable '__version__' -> sink: return in get_version() function.",
  "anomalies": "Unused variable 'version' assigned the same string as '__version__'; no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static version string '__version__' and an alias 'version'. The function get_version() returns this string. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic behavior are present. The variable 'version' is assigned but not used elsewhere, which is benign. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code is straightforward, serving as a version info provider with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version string provider with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
