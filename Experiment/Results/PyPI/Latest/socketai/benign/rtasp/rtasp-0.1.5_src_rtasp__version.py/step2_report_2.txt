  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n1. **Code Verification:**\n   - The code is a straightforward version info snippet:\n     ```python\n     \"\"\"Version information for rtasp package.\"\"\"\n     __version__ = version = \"0.1.5\"\n     def get_version():\n         \"\"\"Return the current package version.\"\"\"\n         return __version__\n     ```\n   - No dynamic code, external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation.\n   - The variable `version` is assigned but not used elsewhere; this is benign.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Evaluation:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No anomalies or unusual constructs are present.\n   - The code simply provides a static version string via a function.\n\n3. **Score Assessment:**\n   - The reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Since the code is straightforward, no change in scores is necessary.\n   - The code does not contain any hidden malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Even if the code were slightly more complex, the current implementation does not warrant any higher risk scores.\n   - The absence of dynamic behavior or external data sources means no threat of malicious activity.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The malware score remains at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score remains at **0**.\n- The overall security risk remains at **0**.\n- Confidence remains high at **1**.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No adjustments are necessary. The code is a benign, standard version info snippet with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, confirming the code's benign nature.",
