  "purpose": "Documentation and metadata declaration for the 'rtasp' package, describing it as a secure voice AI interface for children with parental controls and local processing.",
  "sources": "Package metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __email__) and the initial comment docstring.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing, external calls, or input/output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static metadata and comments are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials beyond standard metadata, no obfuscated or dynamic code, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a descriptive comment, followed by package metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __email__). There are no functions, input/output operations, network calls, or logic that could indicate malicious activity. The metadata indicates the package is aimed at providing a secure voice AI interface, but the code snippet itself is standard metadata declaration with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as package documentation and metadata declaration. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are detected.",
