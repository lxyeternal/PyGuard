  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code Content Summary:**\n- Only contains descriptive comments, metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __email__), and a docstring explaining the purpose.\n- No executable code, functions, data processing, input/output, network calls, or external interactions.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious indicators.\n\n**Review of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, serving as documentation and metadata.\n- No anomalies, suspicious activity, or security risks are identified.\n- The confidence in these assessments is high (confidence=1.0), and all reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities are evident in this fragment.\n\n**Critical Considerations:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable given the code snippet.\n- Since the code is purely metadata and documentation, there is no basis for higher scores.\n- The purpose of the code (a header/metadata for a library) does not warrant concern for malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The provided code snippet is benign.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a harmless header/documentation segment with no security concerns. The current scoring accurately reflects its benign nature.",
