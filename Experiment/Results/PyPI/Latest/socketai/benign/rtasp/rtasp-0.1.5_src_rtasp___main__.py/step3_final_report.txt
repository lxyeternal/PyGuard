  "purpose": "This code serves as the entry point for the 'rtasp' module, providing a command-line interface for launching the application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 're', 'sys', 'os', 'json', 'subprocess', 'traceback', and 'typing' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code contains only imports and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module header with a shebang, descriptive comments, and import statements. No executable logic, data handling, or external calls are demonstrated. The imported modules are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The comments clarify its purpose as an entry point, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The absence of data flows, system calls, or data leaks suggests a benign state. The code's simplicity and lack of executable content support a conclusion of no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module entry point with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current snippet does not warrant any concern or escalation.",
