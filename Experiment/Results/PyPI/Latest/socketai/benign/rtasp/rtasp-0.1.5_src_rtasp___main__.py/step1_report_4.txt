  "flows": "N/A - code snippet does not include operational code or data flow beyond imports",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet is a typical Python entry point script with import statements and comments describing its purpose. There are no executable code blocks, function calls, or data processing shown. No sources, sinks, or data flows are visible in this fragment. The imports are standard for a command-line utility, and no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, benign entry point setup for a Python module. Further code beyond this snippet would need to be reviewed for a comprehensive assessment.",
