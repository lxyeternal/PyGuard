  "purpose": "Entry point for the rtasp module, enabling command-line execution of the application.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include environment variables, command-line arguments, and external scripts called via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include subprocess calls, file operations, or environment modifications (not yet shown in the snippet).",
  "flows": "Data may flow from user inputs or environment to subprocesses or file I/O, but no such flows are explicitly shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in the provided snippet; the code is primarily import statements and module documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal starting point with module documentation, shebang, and import statements. No executable logic, data handling, or external calls are present to analyze further. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments are evident. The imports are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. As this is only the initial part of the module, the full behavior cannot be assessed, but based on the current content, there are no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a foundation for further implementation, and no security concerns are evident at this stage.",
