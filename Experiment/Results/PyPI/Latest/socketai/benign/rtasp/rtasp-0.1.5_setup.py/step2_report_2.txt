  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- The main concern raised is the use of `exec()` to execute `_version.py`. While common, this pattern can be risky if `_version.py` is malicious or tampered with.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are detected.\n- The code appears safe assuming the integrity of `_version.py`.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly describes the script's purpose.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Notes the use of `exec()` but considers it standard for version extraction.\n- **Concerns:** Slight concern about `exec()` but considers it low risk if `_version.py` is safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; the risk is minimal but acknowledged.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Highlights `exec()` as a potential risk if `_version.py` is malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher, but justified given the `exec()` pattern.\n\n#### **Report 4 & 5**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Both agree that the script is standard and safe, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n\n- The only potential security concern is the use of `exec()` on `_version.py`. If this file is compromised, malicious code could execute during installation.\n- All reports correctly identify this pattern as a common but slightly risky practice, depending on the trustworthiness of `_version.py`.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the reliance on `exec()`, a small but real risk exists if `_version.py` is compromised. A conservative estimate would be **0.2** to reflect this, aligning with the highest report's assessment.\n- **Malware risk justification:** No malware present; the concern is the potential for malicious code if `_version.py` is tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a typical, safe setup script.\n- The only minor concern is the use of `exec()` to execute `_version.py`. If `_version.py` is trusted and controlled, the risk is negligible.\n- The reported scores are reasonable; I would suggest:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 0.2 |\n\nThis reflects that the code itself is safe, but the pattern used introduces a slight potential risk depending on external file integrity.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure `_version.py` is stored securely and verified to prevent malicious code execution during setup.",
