{
  "purpose": "Setup script for installing the rtasp package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, reading _version.py for version information.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, no network, file, or environment variable outputs present.",
  "flows": "Reading files (README.md, _version.py) to gather package info; no data flows to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated logic, no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading description files, extracting version info, and configuring metadata. It uses safe file reading methods, and no untrusted input handling or external network interactions are present. All code appears to be standard and straightforward for a setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, and the implementation follows best practices for package configuration.",
