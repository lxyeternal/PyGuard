{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for installing the 'rtasp' Python package, handling package metadata, version extraction, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; executes '_version.py' to obtain version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data flows; only local file reads and execution.",
  "flows": "Reads files into variables; executes '_version.py' via exec() to set version; passes data to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on '_version.py' without validation; standard pattern but potentially risky if the file is malicious or tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks with no malicious intent. The only notable point is the use of exec() to dynamically load version info, which could execute malicious code if '_version.py' is compromised. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package distribution. The risk primarily hinges on the trustworthiness of '_version.py'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The main concern is the exec() call, which is common but could be risky if the version file is compromised. Overall, the package appears secure, with a very low security risk.",
