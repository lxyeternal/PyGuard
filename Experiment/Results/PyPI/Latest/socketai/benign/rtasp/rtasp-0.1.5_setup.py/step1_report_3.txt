    "Use of exec() to run the contents of _version.py, which could execute arbitrary code if the file is malicious",
    "No validation or sandboxing of the _version.py content before execution"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup tasks, which are generally safe. The critical point is the exec() call that executes code from src/rtasp/_version.py. If this file is compromised or malicious, it could execute arbitrary code during installation. However, this is a common pattern for dynamic versioning. No other suspicious or malicious behavior is present, such as network activity, file manipulation, or backdoors. The code appears standard for a setup script, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The risk hinges solely on the integrity of the _version.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with standard practices. The only concern is the use of exec() to read version info, which, if the _version.py file is malicious, could lead to arbitrary code execution during installation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware in this script itself.",
