{
  "purpose": "Setup script for installing the rtasp package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, reading _version.py for version info.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sinks or external calls for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setting LONG_DESCRIPTION; Reading _version.py -> setting version; setup() configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard setup.py structure, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup routines. It reads a README file for long description, which is standard. It retrieves version info by executing _version.py, which is common but should be checked for malicious code, though not inherently suspicious here. All setup parameters, URLs, and email addresses appear legitimate. There are no external data inputs that could be malicious, no code injection points, and no suspicious network activity or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign, standard setup configuration for a Python package. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
