{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to facilitate the installation and setup of the 'rtasp' Python package, including reading the README, extracting version info, and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, reading _version.py to get package version",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious execution",
  "flows": "Input from README.md and _version.py files flow into setup configuration parameters, which are then used to install the package",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the use of exec to execute _version.py could be a minor concern if the file is malicious, but it's standard for dynamic version extraction in setup scripts",
  "analysis": "The code reads static files: README.md and _version.py, then passes data to the setup() function for package configuration. The exec call on _version.py is a common pattern for dynamic version extraction, assuming _version.py contains only safe, controlled code. No external inputs, environment variables, or untrusted sources are involved. The package configuration appears standard and well-structured. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. No obfuscated code or malicious side effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no indications of malicious intent. The only minor note is the use of exec for version extraction, which is a common practice but could be slightly risky if _version.py is tampered with. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
