  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script is a standard `setup.py` for a Python package.\n- Reads `README.md` for long description.\n- Executes `src/rtasp/_version.py` to obtain the version number.\n- Calls `setuptools.setup()` with package metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code performs typical setup tasks.\n- Uses `exec()` to run `_version.py`, which is common but could be risky if the file is malicious or tampered with.\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Finds no anomalies or malicious activity.\n- Correctly notes that the code is straightforward and safe.\n- Assigns malware score 0, risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, notes the use of `exec()` as a minor concern but standard.\n- No malicious activity.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies minimal risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Highlights the `exec()` on `_version.py` as a potential risk if the file is malicious.\n- Correctly states that the code itself is standard but the risk depends on the integrity of `_version.py`.\n- Assigns malware score 0, but notes security risk 0.2 due to the exec pattern.\n- **Justification:** The use of `exec()` is a known pattern but can be dangerous if `_version.py` is compromised.\n- **Recommendation:** The malware score remains 0 because there's no evidence of malicious code in the script itself, only a potential vector if `_version.py` is malicious.\n\n**Report 4 & 5:**\n- Both agree that the code is standard, with no suspicious or malicious activity.\n- No untrusted data sinks, no obfuscated code.\n- Assign malware score 0, risk 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** No. The script is a typical setup script.\n- **Use of `exec()` on `_version.py`:** Slightly risky if `_version.py` is malicious, but common practice. The report appropriately notes this.\n- **Malware score:** Remains at 0, as no malicious code is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the standard nature, 0 is appropriate, but the potential risk from executing `_version.py` could justify a slight increase if `_version.py` is compromised.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to `exec()` usage, but no actual malicious activity)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\nThe setup script is standard, safe, and does not contain malware. The only minor concern is the use of `exec()` to load version info, which is a common pattern but could be risky if the `_version.py` file is malicious or tampered with. No evidence suggests malicious intent or malware in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the nature of the code.",
