  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign or inconclusive, but some exhibit signs of obfuscation and malicious activity. The current scoring system is appropriate, with a recommended slight adjustment to Report 2's malware score. The overall security posture remains moderate, emphasizing the need for further static or dynamic analysis for suspicious cases."
