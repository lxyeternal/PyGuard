  "purpose": "Implement cubic spline-based approximations for sine, cosine, and tangent functions over a specified range using precomputed CSV tables.",
  "sources": "Reading CSV files 'sin_spline.csv', 'cos_spline.csv', 'tan_spline.csv' from a 'data' directory relative to the script location.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation functions (_eval) compute trigonometric approximations; tangent functions raise exceptions at poles.",
  "flows": "CSV data loaded into tables and breakpoints; input 'dt' values are used to find corresponding spline segments; spline evaluation computes approximate sine, cosine, tangent values based on 'dt'; functions handle full-circle inputs with symmetry.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors observed. Repeated definitions of 'sin_full_dt', 'cos_full_dt', 'tan_full_dt' indicate potential redundancy, but do not suggest malicious intent. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected. Use of exception handling at tangent poles is standard for mathematical functions.",
  "analysis": "The code loads precomputed spline data for sine, cosine, and tangent functions, then evaluates these functions efficiently using spline interpolation. It handles full circle computations via symmetry and quadrant logic. All file paths are derived from local file references; no external network communication or data leakage mechanisms are present. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. Redundant function definitions are likely programming artifacts but do not pose security risks. The code appears to be a mathematical approximation implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a mathematical spline approximation for trigonometric functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It loads local data, performs computations, and handles mathematical edge cases appropriately. No malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
