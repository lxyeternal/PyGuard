{
  "purpose": "To load and evaluate cubic spline tables for sine, cosine, and tangent functions in degrees (0-100 DT°) and support full circle calculations (0-400 DT°).",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files ('sin_spline.csv', 'cos_spline.csv', 'tan_spline.csv') from the 'data' directory relative to the script location.",
  "sinks": "Uses the loaded spline tables to compute trigonometric functions; no untrusted data sinks evident. No network, file, or external system calls.",
  "flows": "CSV files are loaded into memory, then spline evaluation functions process input angles to produce sine, cosine, or tangent values. No external data flow beyond initial file reading.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as obfuscated logic, hidden code, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. Functions are straightforward, with standard mathematical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The script loads spline data from CSV files for sine, cosine, and tangent calculations, then provides functions to evaluate these functions for given input angles in degrees or full circle (0-400 DT°) using spline interpolation. It handles quadrant symmetry to compute full-circle sine, cosine, and tangent values. No external system calls, network operations, or suspicious code segments are present. The code appears purely mathematical and data-driven, with no malicious behavior. It also includes proper error handling for tangent calculations near poles.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of spline-based trigonometric evaluations with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions as a mathematical utility module. No malware or security risks detected.",
