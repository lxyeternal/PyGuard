  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured mathematical utility for spline-based trig calculations. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the CSV data files, but this does not indicate malicious code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting the external data dependency but no inherent threat."
