  "purpose": "Implementations of sine, cosine, and tangent functions using cubic spline interpolation from CSV data files, supporting calculations over various ranges including full 0-400 DT° cycle.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files ('sin_spline.csv', 'cos_spline.csv', 'tan_spline.csv') for spline table data; uses Path to resolve file locations.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed within the module; no evident output or network communication; no sinks that handle untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "CSV data loaded into tables; input 'dt' values are processed via _eval; functions like sin_full_dt, cos_full_dt, tan_full_dt convert inputs, handle quadrants, and evaluate spline functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. The code appears to be a straightforward mathematical approximation module.",
  "analysis": "The script loads spline data for trigonometric functions, evaluates them via cubic spline interpolation, and handles full 0-400 DT° cycles with quadrant symmetry. It contains no external network calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious data handling. The code is well-structured and adheres to standard mathematical implementation practices. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected; data loading from CSVs is standard for such approximation tables. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of mathematical functions based on spline interpolation, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior identified. It performs normal mathematical calculations with proper handling of domain-specific edge cases.",
