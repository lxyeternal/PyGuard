{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for calculating sine, cosine, and tangent of angles represented in a custom 'DecUnits' system, with precomputed tables for efficiency.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it initializes a lookup table at import time and processes input angles passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions return mathematical results based on the input; no data is sent over the network or written to files. No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input angle (angle_du) → processed through _fold() → lookup in _sin2_table → mathematical calculations → output result.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses precomputed tables for efficiency; no unusual code structures, obfuscation, or hardcoded credentials are present. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code precomputes sin² values for a quadrant at import time, then folds any angle into the first quadrant with appropriate sign considerations. The functions dec_sin, dec_cos, and dec_tan perform standard trigonometric calculations based on these precomputations. There are no external data inputs, no network operations, no file manipulations, or obfuscated code segments. The use of mathematical functions and table lookups is standard for performance optimization in numerical computations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a mathematical utility module implementing trigonometric functions using lookup tables for efficiency. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and does not exhibit any anomalies or signs of obfuscation.",
