{
  "purpose": "Provides trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) using a precomputed sine squared lookup table with angle folding into quadrants, optimized for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Input angle in DecUnits (angle_du parameter), which is used in the _fold function to determine the quadrant and index.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; the functions return computed float values directly. No data leaks or external communications are involved.",
  "flows": "Input angle_du → _fold (determines index and sign) → lookup in _sin2_table → sqrt to get sin value → dec_cos uses dec_sin with shifted angle → dec_tan computes ratio of dec_sin and dec_cos.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward. The only minor potential anomaly is the ZeroDivisionError in dec_tan when cosine is near zero, but this is a standard safeguard and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code precomputes sine squared values for efficiency, folds any angle into the first quadrant with appropriate sign, and computes sine, cosine, and tangent functions based on this lookup. The functions are deterministic, free of external dependencies, and contain no obfuscation or malicious code. The angle folding ensures correct quadrant-specific sine and cosine calculations. The tangent function handles division by zero explicitly. Overall, the implementation is standard, correct, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, efficient mathematical utility implementing trigonometric functions with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
