{
  "purpose": "The code implements a sine, cosine, and tangent calculation using a lookup table based on the Holoman sin² method, for use with angles in DecUnits.",
  "sources": "The code reads static constants (_TABLE_SIZE, _DU_PER_QUAD, _STEP), input parameter 'angle_du' in functions dec_sin, dec_cos, dec_tan, and data from the precomputed _sin2_table.",
  "sinks": "The functions output floating point results for sine, cosine, and tangent calculations; no data is sent elsewhere or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Input angle_du is processed through _fold to determine lookup index and sign, then used to access _sin2_table, with the result used for trigonometric calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The table is precomputed for efficient lookup. No dynamic code execution, network access, or file I/O is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lookup table for sin² values for a quadrant and functions to compute sine, cosine, and tangent based on angle input in DecUnits. The functions use standard mathematical operations and index calculations without any external dependencies or malicious logic. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a standard mathematical utility module implementing an optimized trigonometric calculation method.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of trigonometric functions using precomputed tables for efficiency. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility module with no suspicious or malicious features.",
