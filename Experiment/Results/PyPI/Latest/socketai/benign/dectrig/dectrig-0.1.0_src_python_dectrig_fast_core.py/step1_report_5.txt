{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for computing sine, cosine, and tangent using a lookup table and angle folding in DecUnits, intended for trigonometric calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only initializes a lookup table at import time and processes function parameters provided by callers.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted. The functions return computed trigonometric values based solely on inputs.",
  "flows": "Input angle_du is processed through _fold to determine lookup index and sign, then used to retrieve a value from _sin2_table, followed by mathematical operations to produce sine, cosine, and tangent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is straightforward, with standard math operations and a precomputed table.",
  "analysis": "The code precomputes a sine squared table for a quadrant and folds any input angle in DecUnits into an appropriate index and sign to retrieve sine squared value and compute sine. The dec_cos function uses the identity sin(100 - θ) for cosine, and dec_tan computes tangent with a check for near-zero cosine. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network access, data leakage, or code injection. The lookup table and calculations are standard mathematical techniques, and no external data is fetched or transmitted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of trigonometric functions using a lookup table and angle folding. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a benign utility module for angle calculations.",
