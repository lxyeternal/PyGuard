{
  "purpose": "This code provides mathematical functions for sine, cosine, and tangent calculations based on a lookup table, intended for use with angles in a custom 'DecUnits' scale. It precomputes a sine squared table for performance efficiency.",
  "sources": "Reads input angles in DecUnits from function parameters: dec_sin, dec_cos, dec_tan, and _fold.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, file I/O, or environment variables are present. No data leaks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input angles are processed through _fold to determine table index and sign, then used in dec_sin, dec_cos, dec_tan functions for calculations. No external data flows or untrusted data propagation are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual dynamic behaviors. The table precomputation and mathematical functions are standard. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs mathematical sine, cosine, and tangent calculations using a precomputed sine squared lookup table for performance. The _fold function wraps and quadrant-corrects angles in DecUnits, returning indices and signs for lookup. No external data inputs, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. The functions are straightforward mathematical implementations with no indication of malicious intent or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of trigonometric functions optimized via lookup tables. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within this code segment.",
