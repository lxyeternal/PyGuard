{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package named DecTrig that exports mathematical functions related to trigonometry, specifically sine, cosine, tangent, and a specialized sin² function.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current module's import statements and the __all__ and __version__ variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks or untrusted data handling points in this code.",
  "flows": "The code's flow is limited to defining the exports and version information without processing external input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and primarily consists of import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a relative module 'fast_core' and exposes them via __all__, along with setting a version string. There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or data manipulation. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving as an API surface. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization file that exports specific functions. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign, straightforward package setup.",
