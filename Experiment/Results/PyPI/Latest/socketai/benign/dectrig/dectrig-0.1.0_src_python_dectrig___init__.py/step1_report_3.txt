{
  "purpose": "Export functions related to trigonometric calculations, specifically for sin, cos, tan, and a custom holoman sin² core.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions from a local module (.fast_core). No input reading or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only exports functions defined elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward module export with version info.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines an export interface for a package, importing functions from a local module and setting a version. No input handling, external data access, or suspicious code constructs are present. The functions are imported from a relative module (.fast_core), which appears to be part of the same package, not external or suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior signs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, harmless module export file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely exposes functions related to trigonometric calculations and contains no suspicious elements.",
