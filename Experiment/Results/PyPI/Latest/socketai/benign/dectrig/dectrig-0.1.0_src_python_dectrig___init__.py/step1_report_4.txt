{
  "purpose": "Export mathematical functions related to the Holoman sin² core, as part of the DecTrig package.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.fast_core' which likely contains the implementations of the functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks, as no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "The module imports functions from a local file and exposes them via __all__, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package initialization file that imports specific functions from a local module and defines exports and version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code patterns. It contains only package metadata and import statements, with no network activity, data handling, or runtime logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign package initializer for DecTrig, exposing functions from the local 'fast_core' module. No malicious intent, no security risks evident.",
