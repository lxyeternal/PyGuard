{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer (__init__.py) that imports specific functions from a local module (.fast_core) and exposes them via __all__, along with setting a version string.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data; it imports functions from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process untrusted input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions from .fast_core and exposes them; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and typical for a package's __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package setup file that imports functions from a local module and exposes them. It contains no dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or hardcoded secrets. The functions imported are from a local module, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns are detected, and the code's purpose is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are justified and accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
