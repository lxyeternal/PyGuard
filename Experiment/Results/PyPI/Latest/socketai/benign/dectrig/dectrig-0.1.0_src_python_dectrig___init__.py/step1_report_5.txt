{
  "purpose": "Define and export mathematical functions related to the DecTrig package, specifically for sin, cos, tan, and Holoman sin² core calculations.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from the local module '.fast_core'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no external input/output operations or network interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code only sets up exports and version information without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with standard imports and exports. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module and declares an export list and version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The functions imported are presumably mathematical operations, with no indication of malicious intent. The code appears to serve as a simple interface or API for other modules or users.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic module setup defining exports and versioning without any malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears safe and intended for mathematical computations related to the DecTrig package.",
