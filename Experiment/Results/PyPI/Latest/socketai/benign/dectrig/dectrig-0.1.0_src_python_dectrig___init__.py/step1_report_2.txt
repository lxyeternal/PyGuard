{
  "purpose": "To export mathematical functions related to the DecTrig package, specifically trigonometric functions and a Holoman sin² core.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions from the relative module '.fast_core'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points involving untrusted data or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported functions in '.fast_core' to the exported symbols in the module's namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code is straightforward, mainly dealing with imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific functions from a local module '.fast_core' and defines what symbols to export and the version number. No dynamic execution, external network access, or handling of untrusted input is present. The structure is minimal and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. Without inspecting '.fast_core', no malicious behavior can be inferred from this snippet. The code appears to serve as an interface layer, exposing mathematical functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving solely as an interface for exporting functions within a mathematical package. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious data handling, or suspicious behavior in this fragment.",
