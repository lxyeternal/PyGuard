{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for verifying the accuracy of trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) implemented in a custom module 'dectrig' using pytest framework.",
  "sources": "Input data is generated via parameterized tests with numeric ranges; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are observed; the code only performs mathematical assertions within test functions.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve parameterized test inputs through custom 'dectrig' functions, compared against Python's math library for validation; no data leaks or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The imported 'pytest' and 'math' are standard libraries; 'dectrig' appears to be a local or third-party module, but usage is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple test functions using pytest to validate the accuracy of custom trigonometric functions. The tests are parameterized with numeric ranges, ensuring comprehensive coverage. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation. The imports are standard, and the test logic involves simple assertions. No external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are present. The module 'dectrig' is imported but not detailed; however, its usage here appears benign, intended for mathematical computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for mathematical functions with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs accuracy validation within a controlled testing environment. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious code elements identified.",
