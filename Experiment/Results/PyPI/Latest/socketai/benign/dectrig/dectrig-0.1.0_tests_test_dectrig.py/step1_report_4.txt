{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for functions related to trigonometric calculations in a module named 'dectrig', likely for validating their correctness.",
  "sources": "Imports math, pytest, and the src.python.dectrig module; uses test parameters for input values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted input or data; the code is only executing mathematical functions and assertions.",
  "flows": "Input values (x) are generated and passed into dt.sin_dt, dt.cos_dt, dt.tan_dt, and their 'full' variants; no data flows from untrusted sources into sensitive sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code strictly performs mathematical testing with predefined parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries for testing mathematical functions and executes a series of parameterized unit tests on trigonometric functions. It compares custom implementations in 'dectrig' against standard math library results with tight tolerances. There is no handling of external input, network activity, file I/O, or other potentially malicious operations. The code's structure is typical for test suites and contains no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward test suite for validating trigonometric functions within a specified module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It is purely for testing correctness of mathematical functions.",
