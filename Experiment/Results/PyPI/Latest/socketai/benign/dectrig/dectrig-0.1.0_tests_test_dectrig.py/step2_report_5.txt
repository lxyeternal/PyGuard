  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard test suite for a custom trigonometric module 'dectrig', with no external or untrusted input, no network or file I/O, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- The code only performs mathematical assertions using pytest and standard libraries.\n- The 'dectrig' module functions are compared against Python's math library, with appropriate tolerances.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are identified.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, and a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. The tests are straightforward and correctly structured.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- **Scores assigned:** Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. Risk scores are 0, reflecting no security concerns.\n- **Malware justification:** Since the code performs only testing of mathematical functions with no malicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives; all assessments are consistent with the code's functionality.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The code is purely a test suite for mathematical functions, with no external data handling, no network activity, and no embedded malicious code.\n- The 'dectrig' module's implementation details are unknown, but based on the tests, it appears to be a custom trig library, likely for performance or precision reasons.\n- The tests verify correctness, not security, and do not expose any vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n**The code is a benign, standard test suite for a custom trigonometric library. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and risk.**\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n**Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.**",
