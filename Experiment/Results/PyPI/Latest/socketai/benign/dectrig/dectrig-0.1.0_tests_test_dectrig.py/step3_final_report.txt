  "purpose": "Test suite validating the correctness of the 'dectrig' module's trigonometric functions against Python's math library.",
  "sources": "Function calls to dt.sin_dt, dt.cos_dt, dt.tan_dt, dt.sin_full_dt, dt.cos_full_dt, dt.tan_full_dt with constant input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Assertions comparing output of 'dectrig' functions to math library results; no external data or untrusted input sources.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (hardcoded in parametrize) flow into 'dectrig' functions, with outputs compared via assertions; no data leaks or external effects observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard pytest tests with clear structure and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of pytest-based tests for a custom trigonometric library, performing correctness checks across a range of inputs. No external data, network, or file I/O is involved. The functions are called with fixed inputs, and their outputs are compared to math library calculations with tight tolerances. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The module 'dectrig' is assumed to be a benign implementation of trig functions, and the tests serve purely for validation. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for a trigonometric library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
