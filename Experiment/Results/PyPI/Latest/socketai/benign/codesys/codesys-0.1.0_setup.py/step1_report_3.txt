{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'codesys' Python package, intended to configure packaging details for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, reading __version__ from __init__.py.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data is being written or executed in a dangerous way.",
  "flows": "Reading files to assign to variables; no dangerous data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures: reading a README for long description, extracting version info from __init__.py, and calling setup() with static parameters. There is no execution of untrusted code, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no inclusion of malicious payloads. The reading of files is static and controlled. The code appears typical for a Python package setup script with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and intended solely for package configuration purposes.",
