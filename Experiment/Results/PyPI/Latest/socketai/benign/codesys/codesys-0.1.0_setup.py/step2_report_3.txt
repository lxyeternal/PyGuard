  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a standard setup script for the 'codesys' Python package.\n- They note that the script reads static files (README.md and __init__.py) and calls `setup()` with static or read-in data.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is observed.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a security risk near 0, indicating no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code indeed reads the README.md and __init__.py files as described.\n- It extracts the version string in a straightforward manner.\n- The setup() call uses only static data or data read from files, with no external input or dynamic execution.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The code is standard for Python packaging, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score (0):** Correct, no malicious code or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Correct, the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk (0.1 or 0):** The first report assigns 0.1, but given the analysis, this is overly cautious. The code does not handle untrusted data, execute code dynamically, or perform network operations. A score of 0 is more appropriate.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The extraction of version info from __init__.py is standard and safe.\n- The code does not contain any signs of backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Overall, the code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.**  \n**Scores should be:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The cautious security risk score of 0.1 in the first report could be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n- No further concerns or flags are warranted.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The current scores are appropriate, with the exception of slightly overestimating the security risk in the first report.",
