{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'codesys', reading metadata and dependencies for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads version information from __init__.py within the 'codesys' package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; setup configuration is standard and does not process untrusted data at runtime.",
  "flows": "Reads input files (README.md and __init__.py) and uses the extracted data for package setup; no untrusted data flows to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file reads to gather package metadata and prepares package setup configurations. All operations are standard for Python packaging. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks detected. The code does not include any network communication, data exfiltration, or dynamic execution. The version is obtained from a likely benign __init__.py file, and no user input is processed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified. It appears safe and standard for package distribution.",
