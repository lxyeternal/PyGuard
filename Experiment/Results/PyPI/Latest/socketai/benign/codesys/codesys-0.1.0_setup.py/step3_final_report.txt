  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'codesys' Python library, reading metadata from files and invoking setup()",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading '__version__' from 'codesys/__init__.py'",
  "sinks": "None; static file reads without executing untrusted data",
  "flows": "File reads (README.md, __init__.py) -> Data stored in variables -> Passed to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic execution; straightforward file I/O and string parsing",
  "analysis": "The code performs static file reads to obtain package metadata and calls setup() with these values. No untrusted input, network activity, or code execution occurs. The version extraction is simple string parsing, unlikely to be malicious. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk (~0 or 0.1). Given the benign nature, the risk score could be adjusted to 0, but 0.1 remains acceptable as a conservative estimate. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The code aligns with standard packaging practices and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, standard setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 are appropriate; a risk of 0 could also be justified. Overall, the code is secure and trustworthy.",
