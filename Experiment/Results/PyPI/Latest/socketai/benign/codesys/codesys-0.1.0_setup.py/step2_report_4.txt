  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, their reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is detected.\n- The code only reads static files and passes data into `setup()`.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- The version is extracted from a presumably benign `__init__.py`.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports confirm the code is benign and standard. No issues are present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are identified in the code.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and very low `securityRisk`. These are reasonable.\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified. No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 or 0 is reasonable, considering it's a standard setup script with minimal risk.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No evidence suggests higher malware or security risk. The scores seem accurate.\n- The reports' confidence levels are 1.0, consistent with the clear, benign nature.\n\n### Consistency and Recommendations:\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment.\n- No changes needed in the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, my estimated scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Very low, standard package setup, minimal security concern.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, with no suspicious or malicious activity.**",
