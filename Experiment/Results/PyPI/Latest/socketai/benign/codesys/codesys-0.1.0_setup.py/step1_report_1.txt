  "purpose": "This script is used to configure the packaging and distribution of a Python SDK named 'codesys'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads __version__ from __init__.py to set version number.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input data is passed to potentially dangerous functions or external commands.",
  "flows": "The code reads data from files, processes version info, and passes data into setup() without external input or dangerous handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script loads static files and assigns their contents to variables, then calls setup() with these parameters. It uses standard practices for Python packaging. No external untrusted data handling, no network activity, no credential management, and no malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and normal.",
