{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'codesys', intended to facilitate package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description and the __init__.py file within the 'codesys' directory to extract the version number.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that process untrusted input; it only reads files and sets up package metadata.",
  "flows": "The version string extracted from __init__.py flows into the setup() function to define the package version. No other data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code performs standard setup procedures with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for packaging, reads the README file for documentation purposes, and extracts the package version from a __init__.py file. It then calls setup() with static and dynamically read parameters. There are no external inputs that could be manipulated or malicious code injections. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script appears benign, performing standard package configuration tasks without any malicious intent or security risks.",
