  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'codesys' Python package, handling package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description, reading __version__ from __init__.py.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data used in vulnerable ways.",
  "flows": "N/A, no untrusted data flow to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. The code performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files for package metadata without executing or evaluating untrusted data. It extracts version info from __init__.py using straightforward string parsing, which is typical. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling detected. The setup parameters are standard and do not include any suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks securely.",
