{
  "purpose": "The code imports an 'Agent' class or object from a local module named 'agent' and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.agent', reading the local module; setting of __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Import from local module is straightforward; no data flow from external untrusted sources; setting version is static.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code constructs observed; minimal code with no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal module that imports from a local 'agent' module and defines a version string. No external inputs, no data processing, no network activity, or other suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears standard and benign. Without additional context from the 'agent' module, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of a simple import and version assignment with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
