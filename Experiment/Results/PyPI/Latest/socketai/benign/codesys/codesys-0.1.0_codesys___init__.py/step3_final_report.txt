{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization, importing the 'Agent' class from a local module and setting a version string for package identification.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data: the import statement and the version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static assignments and import operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; it is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local class and sets a version string, with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The import is relative, typical in package modules. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are all zero or very low, aligning with the benign nature of the code. The overall structure and content are standard for Python package modules, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
