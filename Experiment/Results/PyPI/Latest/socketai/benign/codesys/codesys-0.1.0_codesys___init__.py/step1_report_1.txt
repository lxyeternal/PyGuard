{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up a module by importing an 'Agent' class or function from a local 'agent' module and defining the package version.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .agent import Agent' indicates reading from a local module; '__version__' is a hardcoded string assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks, such as network operations, file writing, or use of environment variables, in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs static assignments and imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module and defines a version string, which is typical for a Python package. No external data input, network activity, or complex logic exists. The import is relative and limited to a local context, and the version string is static. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward module initialization snippet with no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security issues. It appears benign.",
