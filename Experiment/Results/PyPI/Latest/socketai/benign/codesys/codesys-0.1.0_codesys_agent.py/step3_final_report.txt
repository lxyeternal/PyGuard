  "purpose": "A Python SDK wrapper for interacting with the external 'claude' CLI tool, facilitating prompt execution and tool management.",
  "sources": "User input prompts, additional_args dictionary, allowed_tools list, and tools parameter in run_with_tools method.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess command execution with arguments constructed from user inputs and internal variables.",
  "flows": "Input prompts and parameters are used to build command-line arguments, which are then passed to subprocess.Popen or subprocess.run for execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. Argument handling is safe, and subprocess calls are properly managed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs command-line arguments securely as lists, avoiding shell injection risks. It manages subprocesses with proper exception handling, supports streaming output, and allows temporary modification of allowed tools. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The external 'claude' CLI's trustworthiness is outside this code's scope but assumed benign. Overall, the implementation is straightforward, secure, and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented SDK wrapper around an external CLI tool. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk score reflects standard subprocess execution risks. The code is safe for use in supply chain contexts, assuming the external tool is trustworthy.",
