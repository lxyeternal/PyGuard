{
  "purpose": "A Python SDK to interact with the Claude CLI tool for processing prompts with optional tools and streaming capabilities.",
  "sources": "User-provided prompt argument in run() and run_with_tools() methods; environment variables for working directory; command line arguments.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen and subprocess.run calls which execute external commands; stdout and stderr streams; printed output; raised exceptions.",
  "flows": "prompt input -> run() or run_with_tools() -> subprocess command execution -> output/stream handling or error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard subprocess execution. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a wrapper around the 'claude' CLI, configuring command-line arguments, managing allowed tools, and handling streaming output. It safely manages subprocess execution with proper capture and exception handling. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious activity is apparent. The code operates as a standard wrapper without suspicious or malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward SDK for interacting with an external CLI tool. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is a benign, functional interface for running the Claude CLI with configurable options.",
