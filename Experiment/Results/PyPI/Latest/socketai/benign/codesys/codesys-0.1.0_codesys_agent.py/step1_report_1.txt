  "purpose": "A Python SDK for interacting with the Claude CLI tool to send prompts and manage tool permissions.",
  "sources": "User-supplied parameters such as 'prompt', 'additional_args', and 'tools' list; environment variables indirectly via os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to 'claude' command, including subprocess.Popen and subprocess.run, which execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Input data (prompts, args, tools) flows into subprocess commands for execution, with output captured or streamed back.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code. No malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an interface to run an external CLI ('claude') with various options, including streaming output. It uses standard subprocess mechanisms, dynamically builds command-line arguments, and manages allowed tools. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The subprocess commands are typical for executing external tools and do not exhibit risky behavior. The class handles user interruption and error conditions gracefully. The code does not handle any user input directly that could lead to injection beyond standard subprocess argument passing, which appears properly managed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SDK for interfacing with an external CLI tool. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. No malicious intent or suspicious activities are evident. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the trustworthiness of the external 'claude' command it invokes.",
