{
  "purpose": "A Python SDK to interact with the Claude CLI tool, providing methods to send prompts and manage tool permissions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'prompt', 'additional_args', and 'tools'; environment variables used by subprocesses; command-line arguments assembled in 'run' and 'run_with_tools'.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing the 'claude' command with constructed arguments; subprocess pipes for output streaming; potential reading from environment variables indirectly via subprocess.",
  "flows": "User input ('prompt', 'additional_args', 'tools') → command-line construction in 'run' → subprocess execution → output capture or streaming.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are present. The code uses standard subprocess handling and dynamically constructs command-line calls without suspicious modifications. No obfuscated code features identified. No malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an interface for executing the 'claude' CLI tool with specified prompts and options, including allowed tools and output formats. It constructs command-line arguments securely from user inputs and manages subprocesses for streaming or capturing output. The subprocess invocations use standard practices and do not include suspicious code injection, file access beyond executing CLI commands, or network activity beyond the intended subprocess execution. No anomalies such as hidden backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present. The class encapsulates functionality in a straightforward manner without executing untrusted code or manipulating system resources maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SDK for interfacing with a CLI tool, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It securely manages subprocess execution and user inputs without dangerous patterns. Overall, it is safe and follows standard practices.",
