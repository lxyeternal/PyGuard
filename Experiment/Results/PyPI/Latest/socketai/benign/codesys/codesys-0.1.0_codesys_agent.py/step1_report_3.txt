{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python SDK for interacting with the Claude CLI tool, enabling users to send prompts and receive responses, with support for streaming output and configuring allowed tools.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-provided 'prompt' parameters and optional 'additional_args' for command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Data output occurs through returned strings, printed output during streaming, or subprocess outputs. No sinks directly transmit untrusted data externally without proper handling.",
  "flows": "Input prompts flow from method arguments to command-line construction, then to subprocess execution; output data flows from subprocess stdout/stderr to return values or printed output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code uses standard subprocess management with no obfuscated or suspicious language features. It handles exceptions properly.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward wrapper around a CLI tool, constructing command-line arguments based on user input, executing subprocesses for command execution, and managing streaming output. It does not include any external network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications. It handles process termination gracefully and captures output securely. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident. The code appears standard and functional for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign SDK wrapper for the Claude CLI with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It safely manages subprocesses and handles streaming output. Overall, it is a typical application code with no malicious behavior.",
