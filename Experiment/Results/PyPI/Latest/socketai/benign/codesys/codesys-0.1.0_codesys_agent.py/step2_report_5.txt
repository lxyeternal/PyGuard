  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Backdoors:**  \n   All reports explicitly state that no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code uses standard subprocess calls and does not exhibit suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Code Functionality & Behavior:**  \n   The code is a straightforward wrapper around an external CLI ('claude'), constructing command-line arguments based on user input, managing subprocess execution, handling streaming output, and allowing temporary tool permission modifications. It uses safe subprocess practices (list arguments, exception handling, process termination on interruption).\n\n3. **Potential Risks & Vulnerabilities:**  \n   - No evidence of data exfiltration, network communication beyond subprocess execution, or code injection vulnerabilities.\n   - Argument handling appears safe, with no signs of injection or malicious manipulation.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n   - The subprocess commands are constructed from controlled inputs, reducing injection risk.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code. I agree with this assessment.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with no obfuscation detected.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1–0.2). Given the lack of malicious activity and proper subprocess handling, these are reasonable. I concur with these scores.\n\n5. **Claims about Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly avoid assumptions of vulnerabilities; they focus on code behavior and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency & Reasonableness:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Security Risk Score:** **0.1–0.2** — Very low, aligned with the reports and code analysis.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, well-structured SDK wrapper for an external CLI tool. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities are present. The risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed to the reported scores; they accurately reflect the security posture of the code.",
