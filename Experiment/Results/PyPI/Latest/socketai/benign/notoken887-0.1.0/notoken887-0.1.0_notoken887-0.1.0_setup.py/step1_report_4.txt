  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887' including package discovery and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata (name, version, author, description, URL, classifiers, python_requires).",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data output or external data influence.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows involving untrusted input or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is standard setup script with no suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package setup parameters such as name, version, author info, description, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirement. All elements are static strings and do not involve dynamic code execution, external data, or obfuscated logic. No sources or sinks are present that could lead to malicious activity. The URL appears to be a placeholder or unrelated domain, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code follows typical package setup conventions with no signs of malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It only defines package metadata and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
