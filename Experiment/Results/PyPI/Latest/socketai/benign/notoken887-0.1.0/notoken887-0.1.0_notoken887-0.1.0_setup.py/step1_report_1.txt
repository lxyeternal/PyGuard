  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "User-provided data includes package name, version, author info, description, URL, classifiers, and Python requirement.",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; standard setup function usage.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into setup() parameters, but no untrusted data is used in a malicious way.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. All code is straightforward configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata. There are no code injections, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. The URL points to 'https://thugging.org', which may be questionable, but within the scope of this code, it is just a URL string. No hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, no obfuscation, and no malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
