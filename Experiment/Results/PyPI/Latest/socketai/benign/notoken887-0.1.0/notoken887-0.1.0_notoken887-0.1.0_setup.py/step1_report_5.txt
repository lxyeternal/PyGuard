  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging a Python library called 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Input data includes package name, version, author details, description, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The setup parameters are static; there are no dynamic flows from input to output or to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The URL points to 'https://thugging.org', which may be suspicious or malicious; however, this is external metadata and not code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script defining package metadata. It uses find_packages() for package discovery and specifies typical metadata fields. No code execution, input handling, or external communication is present. The URL provided is unusual and could be suspicious, but it does not execute or affect code behavior. No malicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script with no direct malicious behavior. The only notable concern is the URL, which may warrant further review for legitimacy, but it is outside the scope of code analysis. Overall, the script appears benign.",
