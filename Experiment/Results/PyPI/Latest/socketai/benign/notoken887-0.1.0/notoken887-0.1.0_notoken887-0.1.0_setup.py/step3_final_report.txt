  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields: name, version, author, description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no external input or data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The URL 'https://thugging.org' is unusual and potentially suspicious but is only a string literal, not active code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or malicious code. All reports correctly identify the absence of suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. The only external concern is the URL, which is flagged as suspicious but does not influence code execution or security. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero across reports. The security risk score varies slightly (0.1-0.2) due to the URL's nature but remains low, reflecting external metadata rather than code-based threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. External metadata (the URL) is suspicious but does not constitute a security risk within the code itself. Overall, the package poses minimal security concern.",
