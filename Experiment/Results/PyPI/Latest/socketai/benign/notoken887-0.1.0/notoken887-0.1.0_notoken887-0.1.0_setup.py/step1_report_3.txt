  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "User-provided setup arguments, package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks indicating malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'notoken887' and description 'my obfuscation test lib' could suggest testing obfuscation, but no malicious code is present. The URL points to 'https://thugging.org', which may be suspicious, but no active malicious code or network operations are in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, including name, version, author info, description, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirements. There are no dynamic imports, code execution, or data handling beyond static package setup parameters. The URL and package name could be indicators of potential obfuscation or testing, but these alone are not malicious. The script does not contain any code that performs network activity, file operations, or other actions that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical package configuration with no evident malicious behavior. The presence of a suspicious URL and obfuscation mention warrants caution outside this code, but the code itself appears benign.",
