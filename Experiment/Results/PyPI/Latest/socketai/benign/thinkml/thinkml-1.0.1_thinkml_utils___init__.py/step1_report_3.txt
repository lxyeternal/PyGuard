  "purpose": "The code defines a utilities module for the ThinkML project, importing and exposing data preprocessing and evaluation functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .data_utils and .evaluation_utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The module imports functions from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, with no external data flow or user input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are detected. The version string appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module exports and versioning. It imports internal utility functions for data processing and evaluation, which are not shown here. There are no inputs, outputs, or external interactions that could be malicious. The structure and syntax are straightforward, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard Python module setup for a larger project. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It appears to be a benign utility module definition.",
