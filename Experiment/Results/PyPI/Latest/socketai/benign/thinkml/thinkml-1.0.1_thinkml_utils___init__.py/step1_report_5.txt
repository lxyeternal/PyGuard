{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for data preprocessing and model evaluation in the ThinkML project.",
  "sources": "Imports functions 'preprocess_data' from data_utils and 'evaluate_model' from evaluation_utils.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission present.",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports specific functions and sets module metadata. It contains no logic that handles user input, external data, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The only notable aspect is the relative imports, which are typical for package structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports and exports functions as part of a larger package.",
