  "purpose": "Utility module for data preprocessing and model evaluation functions in the ThinkML project.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.data_utils and .evaluation_utils).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "Import statements and module metadata; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and metadata definitions with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports specific functions from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. It sets a version string and contains no data processing, user input, network activity, or code execution. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and standard structure indicate no security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and scores are consistent with this assessment.",
