  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for data preprocessing and model evaluation in the ThinkML project.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing 'preprocess_data' and 'evaluate_model' from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code only imports functions and defines metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only performs import and metadata definition.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The module imports specific functions from internal modules, indicating modular design. It defines a list of exported functions and a version string. No user input handling, data processing, or network operations are present. No anomalies or malicious code behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and aligned with standard Python package practices.",
