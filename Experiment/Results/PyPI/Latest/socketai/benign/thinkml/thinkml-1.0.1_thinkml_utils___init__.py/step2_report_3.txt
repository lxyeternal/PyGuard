  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the validity of their conclusions and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple utility module that imports functions from internal modules and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- No suspicious behaviors, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The code snippets are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are all 0, consistent with the code being clear and unobfuscated.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which seems appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code matches the descriptions; no issues are present.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** None are evident. The code is minimal and standard.\n- **Scores Reasonableness:** The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all 0, matching the reports' conclusions.\n- **Justification for High Scores:** None needed; scores are appropriately low.\n- **Malware Reflection:** The code does not perform any malicious actions; malware score of 0 is correct.\n- **Assumption-based Vulnerabilities:** None are claimed or implied.\n- **Score Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the detailed analyses.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; they all conclude the code is benign.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or security issues are identified.\n- The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions support the low risk assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\nGiven all reports and the code's nature, I agree with their assessments. However, to be thorough, I will assign my own scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious behavior observed.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is clear, straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities detected.\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a minimal, well-structured utility module with no external data handling, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk. No further action needed.",
