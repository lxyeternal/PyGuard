  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for data preprocessing and model evaluation in the ThinkML project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'preprocess_data' from data_utils and 'evaluate_model' from evaluation_utils.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The module imports specific functions from internal modules; no data flow analysis needed as it only exports these functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code behaviors observed. The module is a standard utility wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two utility functions from local modules and sets an __all__ list for export. It specifies a version number. There are no data processing, network activities, or potentially malicious code present. The code appears to be straightforward, serving as an interface for other parts of the project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only imports and exposes functions from other modules without any suspicious or dangerous operations.",
