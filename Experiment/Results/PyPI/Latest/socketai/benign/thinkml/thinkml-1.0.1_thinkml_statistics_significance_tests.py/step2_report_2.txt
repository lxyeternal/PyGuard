  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report to verify the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as performing standard statistical calculations: t-tests, ANOVA, confidence intervals.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or file operations are mentioned.\n- The code uses numpy and scipy, well-known libraries for such tasks.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The results are returned via data classes or tuples, with no side effects or external communication.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Claim:** Code is benign, standard statistical functions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's content. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Claim:** Same as above, no anomalies, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Claim:** Standard statistical functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Claim:** Same as above, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Claim:** Standard implementation, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Key points:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and use standard libraries.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### **Potential adjustments:**\n- The **malware score** is 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- The **security risk score** is 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a standard, benign implementation of statistical functions with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are reasonable and should remain as is.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores are justified given the code's transparency and lack of any suspicious features.
