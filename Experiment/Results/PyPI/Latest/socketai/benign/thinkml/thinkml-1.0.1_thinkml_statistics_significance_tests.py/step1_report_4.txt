{
  "purpose": "The code provides statistical significance tests and analysis functions, including t-tests, ANOVA, and confidence interval calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, specifically numpy arrays for statistical analysis.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations and returns structured results; it does not include any network or system commands, file operations, or other sinks capable of malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (np.ndarray objects) into statistical functions, with results returned as data classes. No untrusted data is used to control system or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs standard statistical computations with clear, well-documented procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common scientific libraries (numpy, scipy) and uses standard statistical formulas for t-tests, ANOVA, and confidence intervals. It converts inputs to numpy arrays, performs calculations, and returns results via data classes. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or system modifications are present. The code strictly adheres to conventional statistical analysis procedures without any unusual constructs or potential backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate statistical analysis code with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates solely within typical statistical computing boundaries, with no malicious sinks, anomalous behaviors, or obfuscated code detected.",
