{
  "purpose": "The code provides statistical analysis functions, including t-test, ANOVA, and confidence interval calculations, primarily for data analysis and hypothesis testing.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are received via function parameters, mainly numpy arrays and list of numpy arrays, with no external data sources or user input handling beyond parameters.",
  "sinks": "Results are returned as data class instances or tuples; no data is written to files, sent over networks, or stored persistently.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into statistical functions where calculations are performed; no untrusted data is transmitted or stored externally; results are returned locally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code performs standard statistical calculations with clear, conventional methods.",
  "analysis": "The code contains well-structured, standard statistical functions utilizing numpy and scipy for calculations. All computations appear straightforward, with no suspicious or hidden operations. No obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or external communication is detected. The functions strictly perform mathematical analysis based on provided data inputs without any side effects or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard statistical computations, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe for use in data analysis contexts.",
