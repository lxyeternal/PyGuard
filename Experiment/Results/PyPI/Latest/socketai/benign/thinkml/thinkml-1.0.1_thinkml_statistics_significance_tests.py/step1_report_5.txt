{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for performing statistical significance tests, including t-tests, ANOVA, and confidence interval calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters to functions such as group1, group2, groups, and data; no external or untrusted sources are explicitly used or accessed.",
  "sinks": "The code performs statistical calculations and returns results via data classes; no sinks for untrusted data, system commands, or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into calculations; results are stored in data classes and returned; no external or untrusted data flow to other systems or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow. The code appears straightforward and focused on statistical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of statistical functions with standard implementations using numpy and scipy; no suspicious behavior, external communication, or malicious code elements are present. All operations are computational, focused solely on data analysis, with no evidence of data leakage, command execution, or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of statistical tests with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic statistical calculations without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
