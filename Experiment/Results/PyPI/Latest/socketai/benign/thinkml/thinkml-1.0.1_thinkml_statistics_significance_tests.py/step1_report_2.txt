{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for statistical significance testing, specifically t-tests and ANOVA, along with confidence interval calculations, for analyzing datasets.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the input parameters 'group1', 'group2', 'groups', and 'data', converting them into numpy arrays for processing.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that send data externally, perform network operations, or write to files. It solely performs statistical calculations in-memory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., 'group1', 'group2', 'groups', 'data') into numpy array conversions, then through statistical functions that compute means, variances, and test statistics, culminating in returning structured results.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The code adheres to standard statistical computation practices without any obfuscated or misleading constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured, implementing standard statistical methods with proper use of libraries (numpy, scipy). It converts inputs into numpy arrays, computes basic statistics, and applies established formulas for t-tests, ANOVA, and confidence intervals. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. There are no external data transmissions, credential usage, or environment variable manipulations. The functions return detailed results in data classes, suitable for further analysis or reporting.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of statistical analysis tools without any malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard calculations reliably and securely. No indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are identified.",
