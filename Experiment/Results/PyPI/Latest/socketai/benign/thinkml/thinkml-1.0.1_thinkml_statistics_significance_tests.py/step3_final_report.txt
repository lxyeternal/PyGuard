{
  "purpose": "Provides statistical significance tests and analysis functions, including t-test, ANOVA, and confidence interval calculations for data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (np.ndarray or list converted to np.ndarray). No external data sources or user inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "Results are returned as data classes or tuples; no data leaks, network activity, or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into statistical calculation functions; results are generated internally and returned without side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical calculations (t-test, ANOVA, confidence intervals) using numpy and scipy. It converts inputs to numpy arrays, computes means, variances, and test statistics following well-known formulas, and returns results via data classes. No external data, network activity, or file I/O is present. The implementation is transparent, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of statistical analysis functions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
