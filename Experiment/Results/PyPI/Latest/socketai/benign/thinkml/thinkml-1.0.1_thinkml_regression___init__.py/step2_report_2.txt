  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a minimal Python module that imports specific classes from the 'thinkml.regression' package and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- There are no data inputs, outputs, network communications, or environment variable manipulations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward package initialization or interface module.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Security Risk Scores:**\n- All reports assign securityRisk = 0, which seems appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Purpose and Analysis:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard module setup, importing classes from a library and exposing them for external use.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- No anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is justified given the code's simplicity and clarity.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- None identified. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**My own estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are thorough and accurate. The code fragment is a typical package initialization script with no malicious or security concerns.",
