  "purpose": "Module setup for exposing regression model classes from the 'thinkml.regression' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'thinkml.regression' modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, network activity, or environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "Importing classes without any data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export of classes, no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports specific regression classes and exposes them via __all__. It sets a version string and contains no data input/output, network communication, dynamic code execution, or secrets. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign module setup. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization script with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and require no modification.",
