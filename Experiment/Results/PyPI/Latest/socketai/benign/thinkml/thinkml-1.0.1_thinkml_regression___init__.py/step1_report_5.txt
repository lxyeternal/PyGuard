{
  "purpose": "This code defines a module that imports specific regression models from the 'thinkml' library and sets versioning and export variables.",
  "sources": "The imports from 'thinkml.regression' modules indicate data or model access, but no input reading from external sources such as user input or files.",
  "sinks": "The code exports certain classes for external use; no sinks are evident related to untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the code solely imports and exposes classes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three regression models from an external library, sets a version string, and defines the module's exported classes. No data reading, user input, or network activity is present. The code is minimal, standard, and has no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module for exporting regression models from the 'thinkml' library with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
