{
  "purpose": "This code defines a module that imports specific regression models from the 'thinkml' library and exposes them for external use, providing versioning information.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'thinkml.regression' packages, specifically 'quantile_regression', 'robust_regression', and 'censored_regression'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external communications present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external input; the code simply imports modules and sets export variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets observed. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific regression classes from a third-party library and declares its version. It does not perform any data processing, input handling, or network operations. The structure is standard for a Python module exposing certain classes. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be a simple wrapper or interface for regression models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic module setup importing regression models and exposing them for external use. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
