{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an initialization module for the ThinkML regression package, exposing specific regression classes for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes from the 'thinkml.regression' package and defines metadata variables (__version__ and __all__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and conventional for package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three regression classes from the thinkml.regression submodule, sets a version string, and defines __all__ for module exports. No input/output handling, environment variable use, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The structure and content are consistent with standard package initialization files, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module setup for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It simply exposes certain classes for external use and does not process or handle untrusted data.",
