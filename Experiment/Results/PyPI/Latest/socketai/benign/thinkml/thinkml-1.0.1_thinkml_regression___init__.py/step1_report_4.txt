{
  "purpose": "This code defines imports and exports for advanced regression models related to ThinkML, likely for use in a larger machine learning framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from the thinkml.regression package: quantile_regression, robust_regression, censored_regression",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms identified",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports and exports class definitions without data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected; code appears straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific regression classes from the thinkml.regression module, sets a version string, and defines an __all__ list for module exports. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, no network activity, or other suspicious behavior. The code is purely declarative, setting up module exports for regression models. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are apparent. The simplicity and clarity suggest this is a standard module file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module that imports specific regression classes and prepares them for external use. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, straightforward component of a larger machine learning package.",
