  "purpose": "Define and export advanced regression models for ThinkML by importing specific regressors from their modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'thinkml.regression' modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink for untrusted data or actions; no network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "Imports from thinkml.regression modules are straightforward; no complex data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports three regression classes from a library named 'thinkml'. It sets a version string and defines __all__ for exports. No data input, network communication, or sensitive operations are present. The code is minimal, straightforward, and appears to be a standard module setup for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module initialization script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports and exports regression models, serving as a part of the larger ThinkML package. There is no evidence of malware or security threats.",
