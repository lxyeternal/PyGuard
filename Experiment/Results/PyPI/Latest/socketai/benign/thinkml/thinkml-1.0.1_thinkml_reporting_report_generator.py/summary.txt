  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard report generation utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware score of 0 is justified. External process invocation via pdfkit and filesystem access are typical for such tasks but should be used with secure environment controls. Overall, the code is safe for production use, and the scores in the reports are consistent with the analysis."
