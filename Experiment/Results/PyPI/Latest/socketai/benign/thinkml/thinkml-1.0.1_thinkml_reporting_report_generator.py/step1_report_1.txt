{
  "purpose": "To generate a comprehensive report for machine learning experiments including visualizations, data summaries, preprocessing steps, and model evaluation results.",
  "sources": "User-provided data in the data_summary, preprocessing_steps, models_results parameters; data read from data_summary dictionary; files written to disk (HTML or PDF output).",
  "sinks": "File system (writing HTML and PDF files), base64 encoding of images, HTML rendering via Jinja2, and PDF generation via pdfkit from HTML content.",
  "flows": "Data from input parameters flows into visualization creation, which encodes images into base64 strings; these are then injected into an HTML template, which is either saved as an HTML file or converted to PDF and saved. The file output steps are the primary sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior detected. Use of third-party libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, jinja2, pdfkit) appears standard for report generation. No signs of code obfuscation, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard report generation module, creating visualizations, rendering HTML templates, and exporting to HTML or PDF formats. It uses well-known libraries and straightforward logic. No dynamic code execution, network calls beyond PDF generation, or suspicious handling of input data are observed. The flow of data is typical for report generation. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate report generation tasks without any malicious intent. It leverages common libraries and standard data handling procedures. No signs of malware or security risks are present. The overall security risk score is very low.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
