{
  "purpose": "The code generates comprehensive reports for machine learning experiments, including visualizations and HTML/PDF outputs.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include data_summary, preprocessing_steps, models_results, and potentially external template files for report generation.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output files (HTML or PDF) and encodes images in base64 for embedding in reports.",
  "flows": "Data flows from data_summary and other inputs into visualization functions, which generate images encoded in base64; these are embedded into HTML templates rendered and saved as files or converted to PDF.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are present. The code utilizes standard libraries for visualization and report generation. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports common libraries (os, base64, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, jinja2, pdfkit, io) and defines functions to generate visualizations and assemble reports. Visualizations are created based on input data summaries and are encoded in base64 for embedding into HTML. The report generation process involves rendering templates with data, then saving as HTML or converting to PDF via pdfkit. All data handling appears confined to report generation purposes, with no external data sources or network connections involved. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or malicious logic is detected. The code relies on external template files, which should be inspected separately for potential malicious content, but in this module, no malicious code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard report generation module that utilizes open-source libraries to produce machine learning experiment reports. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain risks based on the provided code. Its operations are limited to data visualization, template rendering, and file writing. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment.",
