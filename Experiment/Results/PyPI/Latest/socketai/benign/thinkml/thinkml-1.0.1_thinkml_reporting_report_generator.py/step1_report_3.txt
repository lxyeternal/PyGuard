{
  "purpose": "Generate comprehensive reports for machine learning experiments, including visualizations, summaries, and model evaluation results.",
  "sources": "Input data in 'data_summary', 'preprocessing_steps', and 'models_results' parameters, as well as environment variables indirectly through file paths for templates.",
  "sinks": "Writing HTML or PDF files to disk, encoding images as base64 strings, and rendering templates via Jinja2. No direct data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries into visualization functions, then into HTML rendering, and finally to disk or PDF generation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. Usage of external libraries like pdfkit and Jinja2 is standard for report generation. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input data for report generation and creates visualizations stored as base64-encoded images. It renders an HTML report using a template file in the same directory. The generated report can be saved as HTML or converted to PDF via pdfkit. There are no suspicious or malicious activities such as network communications, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code. The use of external libraries is typical for report creation, and no hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard report generation module for machine learning workflows. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is solely to produce visual and textual reports from provided data. The code appears benign.",
