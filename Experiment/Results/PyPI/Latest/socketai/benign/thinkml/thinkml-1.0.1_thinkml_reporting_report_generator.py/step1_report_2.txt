{
  "purpose": "Generate comprehensive reports for machine learning experiments, including data summaries, preprocessing steps, and model evaluation results.",
  "sources": "Reads data from data_summary dictionary, uses environment variables to load Jinja2 template, reads image data from BytesIO buffers, and loads a template file from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Writes HTML reports to disk, converts HTML to PDF via pdfkit (which may invoke external processes), encodes images in base64, and potentially reads template files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (data_summary, preprocessing_steps, models_results) into visualization creation; visualizations are embedded into HTML; HTML content is written to file or converted to PDF.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment-based template loader (could be misused if environment is maliciously set), no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily creates visualizations from provided data summaries, encodes them as base64 images, and renders an HTML report using a Jinja2 template loaded from the filesystem. The report can be saved as HTML or converted to PDF using pdfkit. The use of environment variables to load templates and standard libraries for plotting and file operations are typical and not inherently malicious. No suspicious network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code does perform file I/O and external process invocation (pdfkit), but these are standard for report generation. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward report generation module with standard practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It relies on external libraries and filesystem access for template loading and report saving. Overall, the risk of malicious intent is very low.",
