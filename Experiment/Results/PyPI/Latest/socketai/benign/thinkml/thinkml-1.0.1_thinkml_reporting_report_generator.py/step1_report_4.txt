{
  "purpose": "To generate comprehensive reports for machine learning experiments, including data summaries, preprocessing steps, and model evaluation results.",
  "sources": "Reads input data via the data_summary dictionary, including feature types, missing values, class distribution; uses environment loader to read a template file; reads and writes files to disk; generates visualizations and encodes them in base64.",
  "sinks": "Writes HTML reports to disk; calls pdfkit.from_string() to generate PDFs; potentially processes base64 encoded images; reads template file from filesystem.",
  "flows": "Data flows from data_summary into visualization functions, which generate images encoded in base64; visualizations and other data are passed to HTML template rendering; final HTML is written to disk or converted to PDF.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment-based template loader (no immediate anomaly); no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious file operations beyond reading template files and writing reports; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code creates visualizations based on dataset summaries, encodes them, and inserts them into an HTML report via Jinja2 templates. It then saves the report as HTML or converts it to PDF using pdfkit. The functions appear standard and do not exhibit malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious external connections are evident. The only external system interaction is with the filesystem for template loading and report output, and with pdfkit for PDF generation. Overall, the code seems benign and intended solely for report generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate report generation module with no signs of malicious behavior. It reads dataset summaries, generates visualizations, and outputs reports securely. There are no indications of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration.",
