{
  "purpose": "Utility module for evaluating machine learning models, providing metrics, plots, and cross-validation functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy, pandas, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.model_selection, matplotlib, seaborn; no external input or untrusted data sources are read within functions.",
  "sinks": "Model.predict, model.predict_proba; data arrays X, y, X_test, y_test; plotting functions for visual output.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into predict methods, metrics calculations, and plotting functions; no external or untrusted data flow into sensitive sinks outside provided data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed; all code functions are standard for model evaluation; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard machine learning evaluation utility with functions for computing metrics, generating plots, and cross-validation. It handles data inputs and model predictions in a typical manner, with no signs of malicious data handling or obfuscated code. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The plotting functions visualize model performance. The functions rely solely on passed-in data and models, with no hidden or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for model evaluation, with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It is a standard implementation that performs metrics calculation and visualization for ML models.",
