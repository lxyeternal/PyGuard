{
  "purpose": "The module provides utility functions to evaluate machine learning models, including metrics computation and visualization, primarily for classification and regression tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data: function parameters X, y, X_test, y_test; model predictions via model.predict and model.predict_proba.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include plotting functions (matplotlib, seaborn) and model.predict/predict_proba calls; no evidence of data leaks or malicious output manipulation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through prediction functions, into metric calculations, and into plotting functions; no untrusted external data sources or sinks are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present; code follows standard ML evaluation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard evaluation utility with functions to compute metrics, generate plots, and perform cross-validation. It uses common libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn) in conventional ways. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious activity is evident. The only potential concern might be the extensive use of plotting which could be manipulated for visual deception, but this is typical for evaluation scripts and not malicious. The code does not include any network operations, file writing, or hidden backdoors. Overall, the code appears benign and intended solely for model evaluation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard machine learning model evaluation utility without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs metrics calculation and visualization securely and transparently, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
