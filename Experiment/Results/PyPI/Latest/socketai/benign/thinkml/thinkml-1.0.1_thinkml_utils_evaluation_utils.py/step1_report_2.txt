{
  "purpose": "The module provides utility functions for evaluating machine learning models, including metrics computation, plotting, and cross-validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn; functions taking model, data, and evaluation parameters.",
  "sinks": "Predictions, metric calculations, plotting functions.",
  "flows": "Model predict and predict_proba methods generate predictions -> metrics calculations use predictions -> plotting functions visualize results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; standard evaluation procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical model evaluation tasks with data conversions, metric calculations, cross-validation, and plotting. It dynamically determines task type, handles binary and multi-class classification, regression, and creates visualization plots accordingly. All operations are standard for ML evaluation. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, file operations, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on well-known libraries and methods for model assessment without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign utility for model evaluation without any malicious intent or security risks.",
