  "purpose": "Provides functions for evaluating machine learning models, including metrics calculation and visualization.",
  "sources": "Model predictions, input features (X), target labels (y), optional test data (X_test, y_test).",
  "sinks": "Predictions used for metrics; no external data or network activity; no data leaks or sensitive info handling.",
  "flows": "Model.predict() outputs feed into metrics and plots; data flows from inputs to evaluation outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard ML evaluation utility relying on common libraries. It performs predictions, computes metrics, and generates plots for classification and regression tasks. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation observed. The logic is straightforward, with proper handling of metrics and cross-validation. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The code's behavior aligns with expected evaluation workflows, and the scoring of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured ML evaluation utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the confidence in this assessment is high.",
