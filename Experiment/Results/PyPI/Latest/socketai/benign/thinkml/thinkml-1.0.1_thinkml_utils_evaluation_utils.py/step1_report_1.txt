{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for evaluating machine learning models, including metrics calculation, plotting, and cross-validation.",
  "sources": "Input data (X, y, X_test, y_test), model predictions, cross-validation scores.",
  "sinks": "Predictions (model.predict, model.predict_proba), plotting functions (matplotlib, seaborn), cross-validation scoring.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into model predictions and metric computations; predictions and metrics are used to generate plots; cross-validation scores are computed and visualized.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. Use of common libraries and functions appears standard for model evaluation.",
  "analysis": "The module uses well-known machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for model evaluation and visualization. It performs model predictions, metric calculations, and plotting without any evident malicious behavior. There are no hidden network communications, data exfiltration, or code that could be used maliciously. All data handling and computations align with typical model evaluation workflows. No suspicious anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The code is well-structured and consistent with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard machine learning evaluation utility with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It performs model assessment tasks securely and transparently, with no suspicious behaviors identified.",
