  "purpose": "Provides statistical test and significance analysis functions by importing them from a local module.",
  "sources": "Imports from .significance_tests module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output sinks are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; import statements are static and do not process external data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module and exposes them via __all__, setting a version string. There are no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious activities observed. The code appears to be a simple module interface definition without any malicious components or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module definition for statistical functions with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
