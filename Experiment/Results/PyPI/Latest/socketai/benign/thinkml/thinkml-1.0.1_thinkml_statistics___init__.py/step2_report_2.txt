  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code presence and behavior:**\n   - The original code is a simple Python module that imports three functions from a local module (`significance_tests`) and exposes them via `__all__`. It also sets a version string.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Security and malicious activity:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n   - The structure is typical for a package interface or `__init__.py` file.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious flows, or obfuscation are detected.\n\n3. **Scores assessment:**\n   - **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated:** All report 0, which is correct.\n   - **Malware:** All report 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n   - **Security risk:** All report 0, as no security issues are present.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is a simple interface module with no malicious or risky behavior.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on static inspection.\n\n5. **Score justification:**\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate; there's no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is correct.\n   - The overall security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Additional considerations:**\n   - Since the code only imports and re-exports functions, any security concern would stem from the imported `significance_tests` module itself, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|--------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0      | No malicious activity detected; code is purely import/export setup.        |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      | Clear, straightforward code; no obfuscation present.                        |\n| Security Risk      | 0      | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.                           |\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard module interface with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.",
