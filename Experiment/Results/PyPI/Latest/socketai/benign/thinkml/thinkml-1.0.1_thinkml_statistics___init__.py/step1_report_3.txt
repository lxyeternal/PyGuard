  "purpose": "Provides statistical tests and significance analysis functions by importing them from a local module.",
  "sources": "Imports from a relative module '.significance_tests'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only sets up exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is straightforward module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module for statistical testing functions, importing specific functions from a relative module. It sets a version string and exports the functions for external use. There are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code performs a typical package setup with no external network access or data handling that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports functions from an internal module, with no suspicious features detected.",
