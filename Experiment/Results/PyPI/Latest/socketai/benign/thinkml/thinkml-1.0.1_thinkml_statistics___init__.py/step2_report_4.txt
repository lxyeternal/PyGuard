  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the code in question.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a minimal Python module that imports three functions (`t_test`, `anova_test`, `confidence_interval`) from a local module named `.significance_tests`.\n- It sets a version string and defines `__all__` to specify what symbols are exported.\n- The code contains no data processing, input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and typical for a package interface.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review of Reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no suspicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security risks.\n- They correctly identify that the code only imports functions from a local module and exposes them, with no external data handling or network activity.\n\n**Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**\n- None of the reports claim or imply any vulnerabilities, exploits, or malicious intent that would warrant concern.\n- The reasoning is consistent and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are evident.\n\n**Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n- Since the code only imports and exports functions, any potential malicious behavior would likely reside in the imported module `.significance_tests`.\n- Without inspecting `.significance_tests`, we cannot fully rule out malicious content there, but based on the reports, the focus is on this module alone, which appears safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n- The code and reports collectively indicate a benign, standard module interface.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, benign interface module for statistical functions, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports correctly reflect this assessment.",
