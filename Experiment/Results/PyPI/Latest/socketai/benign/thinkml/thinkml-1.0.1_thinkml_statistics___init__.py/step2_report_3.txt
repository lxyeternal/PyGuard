  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a simple Python module that imports three functions from a local module named `significance_tests` and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- It sets a version string.\n- There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, no input/output operations, and no obfuscation.\n- The code appears to be a standard package interface or `__init__.py` file.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious components. All reports agree on this point.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** The security risk score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the straightforward, benign code.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning errors:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this is a simple module setup with no security concerns.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities that are not present.\n- The analysis correctly dismisses any suspicion of malicious activity.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The scores assigned are all 0 for malware, obfuscated, and 0.5 or below for security risk, which is appropriate.\n- Since the code is purely import/export setup, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports do not mention any hidden or malicious code, which is accurate.\n- No suspicious behaviors or code patterns are suggested or observed.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty about benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the evidence, I agree with the reports' conclusions that this code is benign and poses no security risk. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional note:** Since the code is just a module interface, it cannot be malicious unless the imported functions themselves are malicious, which is outside the scope of this review.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
