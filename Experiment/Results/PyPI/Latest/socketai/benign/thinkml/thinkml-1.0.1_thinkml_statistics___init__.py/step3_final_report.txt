  "purpose": "Provides statistical tests and significance analysis functions by importing them from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .significance_tests module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or external outputs",
  "flows": "Importing functions and exposing them via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export of functions",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module, likely an __init__.py, importing three functions from a local module and exposing them through __all__. It sets a version string. There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or secrets. The code's simplicity and structure indicate a benign package interface. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The imported functions are external to this snippet, but within this code, no malicious activity or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package interface module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and structure.",
