  "purpose": "Provides statistical testing and significance analysis functions by importing from a local module.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the relative module .significance_tests",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; code defines module exports only",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to output; module imports and exports only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific functions from a local relative module and exposes them via __all__, with a version attribute. It contains no user input handling, no external network calls, and no suspicious logic or obfuscation. The code appears to be a standard module setup for statistical functions without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple interface for statistical testing functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
