  "purpose": "Provides statistical testing functions and significance analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from a local module .significance_tests.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "Imports functions which could be used elsewhere, but no data flow or execution flow indicates malicious activity within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward, with only import statements and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as an initialization or module interface file, importing functions for statistical tests from a local module. It sets version info and exports a list of functions. There is no code execution, input handling, or data processing that could be malicious. The content appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module interface setup for statistical functions with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks identified.",
