  "purpose": "Provides statistical tests and significance analysis functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from a local module named significance_tests.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; import statements are static.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and follows typical package structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports three functions from a local module named significance_tests and exposes them via __all__. It sets a version string and does not perform any data processing, network operations, or untrusted data handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The structure and content are consistent with a standard Python package component.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as a module interface for statistical functions without any signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
