  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:  \n   The provided code is a minimal Python module that imports three functions (`t_test`, `anova_test`, `confidence_interval`) from a local module named `.significance_tests`. It sets a version string and exposes these functions via `__all__`. The code contains no data processing, no user input/output, no network operations, and no obfuscation.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   - **Code correctness**: The code appears syntactically correct and logically straightforward.  \n   - **Malicious behavior**: No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.  \n   - **Obfuscation**: None detected.  \n   - **Security risks**: No data handling, external communication, or security-sensitive operations.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - All reports consistently describe the code as benign, straightforward, and free of suspicious activity.  \n   - They correctly identify that the code is a simple interface module.  \n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n4. **Score Justification and Recommendations**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign `0`. Correct, as no obfuscation is present.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign `0`. Justified, as there's no indication of security issues.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores**:  \n   - Since all reports agree on zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores, and the code is straightforward, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   - The code relies on a local module `.significance_tests`. Without inspecting that module, potential risks could exist there, but based solely on this snippet and reports, there's no evidence of malicious intent.  \n   - The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly emphasizing the benign nature.\n\n7. **Final Assessment**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n   - **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a standard, harmless module that imports and exposes statistical functions. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate** after careful review:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
