  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the 'thinkml' Python library, reading static README.md, defining dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads static README.md file; no untrusted input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static data used throughout.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, straightforward setup script for Python packaging. It reads a static README file, specifies dependencies with fixed versions, and sets package metadata. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no network activity, and no suspicious logic. All reports correctly identify this as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code structure and content are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or security issues. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
