{
  "purpose": "Provides data preprocessing functions for machine learning workflows, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling, and outlier treatment.",
  "sources": "Reads input data (X) which can be a numpy array or pandas DataFrame; reads target data (y); accesses DataFrame columns for feature selection and encoding.",
  "sinks": "Transforms data via imputation, encoding, scaling, and outlier treatment; outputs processed numpy array data, potentially including encoded features or scaled values.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input; missing values are imputed; outliers are handled; features are scaled and encoded; target labels are transformed if needed; final numpy array is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code performs standard data preprocessing tasks; no external network calls or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data preprocessing steps with no indications of malicious intent. It uses established sklearn transformers and pandas for data handling. All operations are standard, with no suspicious logic, network activity, or backdoors. Data transformations are confined to the provided dataset, with no external data fetching or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard data preprocessing utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It adheres to typical data transformation practices without including malicious or suspicious code segments.",
