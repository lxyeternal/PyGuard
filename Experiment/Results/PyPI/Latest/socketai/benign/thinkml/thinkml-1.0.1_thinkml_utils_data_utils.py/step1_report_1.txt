{
  "purpose": "The module provides functions for data preprocessing and manipulation, including handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and handling outliers.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input variables X and y, which can be numpy arrays, pandas DataFrames, or Series.",
  "sinks": "Processed data is returned as numpy arrays. No data is written to external sources or network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables through transformations such as imputation, encoding, scaling, and outlier handling, and is ultimately returned as processed arrays.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard libraries and functions without any suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are evident. The encoding process properly handles unknown categories with 'ignore'. The outlier handling replaces outliers with the mean value, which is standard practice. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data preprocessing steps using well-known sklearn functions, with input validation and feature type detection. It transforms data for machine learning pipelines without any external network operations, system modifications, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears clean, standard, and safe, focusing solely on data transformation tasks. No signals of malicious intent or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data preprocessing utility with no signs of malicious behavior. It employs common techniques and libraries appropriately. No security risks or malware indications are identified.",
