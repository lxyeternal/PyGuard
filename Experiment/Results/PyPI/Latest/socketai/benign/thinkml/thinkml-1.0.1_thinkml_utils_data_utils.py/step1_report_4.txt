{
  "purpose": "Provides data preprocessing functions for handling missing data, encoding, scaling, and outlier management for machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data X (np.ndarray or pd.DataFrame), optional target y, and feature lists for categorical and numerical features.",
  "sinks": "Transforms data via imputation, encoding, scaling, and outlier adjustment; no direct data leakage or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through imputation, outlier correction, scaling, and encoding steps before being output as a numpy array; target y is optionally transformed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the code appears standard for data preprocessing without obfuscated constructs, hidden behaviors, or malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data preprocessing utility using well-established scikit-learn methods. It converts input types, identifies feature types, handles missing values with common strategies, optionally manages outliers via mean substitution, scales numerical features with standard, min-max, or robust scalers, and encodes categorical features via one-hot or label encoding. The optional transformation of target labels is also standard. No external network calls, hidden code, or data exfiltration routines are present. The code operates solely on provided data, with no evidence of malicious intent or covert behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard, benign data preprocessing utility without malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. It adheres to typical data handling patterns and uses common scikit-learn methods, presenting no security concerns.",
