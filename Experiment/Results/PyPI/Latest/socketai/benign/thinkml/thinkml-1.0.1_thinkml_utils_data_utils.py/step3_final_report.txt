  "purpose": "This code provides a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline for machine learning tasks, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and managing outliers.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from numpy arrays or pandas DataFrames; accesses feature columns for processing; reads target variable y if provided.",
  "sinks": "Transforms data in-place during imputation, encoding, scaling, and outlier handling; outputs processed numpy array features and optionally the target variable.",
  "flows": "Source data (X, y) -> feature identification -> missing value imputation -> outlier correction -> scaling -> encoding -> final numpy array output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code converts input to DataFrame if necessary, identifies feature types, imputes missing data with standard strategies, optionally handles outliers by replacing outliers with mean, scales numerical features with selected scaler, encodes categorical features via one-hot or label encoding, and finally converts processed data back to numpy arrays. No suspicious external calls or malicious logic are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and employs common data processing techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data preprocessing utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal security risk score of 0.1 are justified and appropriate.",
